Permalink",False,"I'll admit that I've never seen ""Waiting for Guffman"", 1997's critically acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town thats that stages a pageant. When the advertising for Best in Show had the tagline ""From the Team That Brought You Waiting for Guffman"", a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film. For shame, critics, for shame times two! Any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn't want to share the film's wealth with the rest of the world, but this is one film that I hope people will experience, now that its video/dvd. ""Best in Show"" is, without a doubt, the best comedy of 2000.

The film begins with a mockumentary style, introducing the main competitors (not to mention screwballs) of the annual Mayflower ""Best In Show"" competition, where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog. We have the loveable and gullable Harry Pepper (Guest) with his bloodhound, the simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy & O'Hara) with their terriors, nut-case yuppies Hamilton & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), the gay dog groomers Scott Dolan & Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins & McKean), and the airheaded millionare Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) along with her trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch). They all have their minds on one simple object: The Blue Ribbon, which will be awarded to the best dog. And...do I have to tell you the rest?

Director/writer/star Guest's idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at, and that the idiocy of films like ""American Pie"" or other pointless ""teenage"" flicks won't take over the world after all. His idea is simple: make your comedy not just funny, but SMART funny. But instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like ""Zero Effect"" and ""High Fidelity"", he used a rather unusual approach (and as I understand, he also used this approach for ""Guffman""). Whether you notice or not, a very large part of the film is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script, maybe even not even dreamed of by Guest and co-writer/star Levy. But with a gentle hand from Guest, he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have flopped if handled by other, less adept actors. Now that's smart!

The cast is, of course, what makes improv work the most. All of them are a (comedic) marvel to behold, especially Guest as Pepper. But the real standout has to be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, the clueless announcer at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream of...that is, if the announcer was trying to be funny. Williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can bench press. There's even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing strategy: have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like ""have a doggie-style of a time"". Its priceless, as is his performance.

I hope that people engage in this 90-minute ""dogumentary"". The film deserves so much recognition. It did get nominated for Best Picture-Comedy at the Golden Globes, but didn't win. I can't see why. I mean, in the comedy department, it is best in show.

Permalink",False,"You would almost have to have seen the dog show world first hand to understand all the delicious inside jokes, but even if the extent of your dog show experience is an occasional glimpse of the Westminster Dog Show telecast, you'll howl with laughter.

Conformation dog showing is a world of illusion in which everyone tries to make perfect dogs out of something less. Best in Show strips the illusion away in a brutal satire that undoubtedly had every dog person on the planet cringing in horror and delight. ""Isn't that just like so-and-so?"" and ""I'm nothing like that!""

Christopher Guest may have topped his supreme masterpiece ""Spinal Tap"" with this signature mockumentary in which he skewers all of dogdom. You will recognize Fred Willard's vapid and obnoxious television host as none other than Joe what's his name from Westminster, and the tension between him and Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock) is a thinly veiled roman a clef of David and Joe at the Big Show.

There are a few gaffs, like the fact at all the dogs at the Show are supposed to be champions before entry, but that doesn't detract from the fun. John Michael Higgins, who steals the show as the uninhibited handler, and Michael McKean are hilarious as the gay couple going out of their way to be outre. Co-writer Eugene Levy (American Pie) is perfect as the husband finding out that his wife Catherine O'Hara might be Miss Congeniality of all time. I also loved Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock as the overwrought yuppie couple who project all their angst on their poor dog. Larry Miller turns in a great cameo as one of the countless men in O'Hara's past.

A lot of people didn't get this gem. To them I can only say Bad Dog, Bad Dog! For the rest of us, it's Sit, Stay, and Enjoy!"

Permalink",False,"Best in Show (2000) Directed by Christopher Guest. Written by Guest and Eugene Levy. Starring Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock, Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgins, Michael McKean, Guest and Fred Willard. Running Time: 90 minutes Rated PG-13

Dog people, and the dogs that own them, are often amusing in real life. But in the hands of master mock documentarist Christopher Guest, the amusement is marvelously magnified. (Guest practically invented the ""mockumentary"" with his 1984 rock band send-up, ""This is Spinal Tap."")

In the days leading up to the Mayfair Kennel Club Dog Show, several sets of contestants make their way to Philadelphia to realize a dream of being ""Best in Show."" There's a pair of New York yuppies (Posey and Hitchcock) who are even higher strung than their willful weimaraner. A gay couple (Higgins and McKean) shows up to show off their shih tzu. A Florida husband and wife (Levy and O'Hara) make the trip with their terrier, discovering along the way that every man they meet is one of her former lovers. And finally, springing fully-grown from a country music song, lonely guy Harlan Pepper (Guest) arrives from North Carolina in a pickup truck with his droop-faced bloodhound. Once at the show, the odd assortment of owners conduct their canines toward a ""best in show"" showdown, where brilliantly inept color commentary is provided by Buck Laughlin (Willard).

Even though fairly well known actors play the primary roles, Guest achieves a documentary feel, mainly because much of the dialogue seems improvised. As writer-director, he deserves credit, either for writing sharp dialogue, or for directing in a way that inspires creativity in his actors.

Some of the best lines come from Posey and Hitchcock, the yuppie couple who met when their eyes locked as they sipped coffee at separate but close-by Starbucks, and whose pooch becomes paranoid whenever they get intimate in its presence. The other cast members ably deliver lines that define their quirky characters. Especially good is O'Hara as a woman with a past who is nonetheless devoted to spouse Levy, who literally has two left feet. Even the background extras, probably real-life dog handlers, are fascinating to watch, and seem to inhabit their own documentaries, waiting for their own close-ups.

The last third of the film brings the entire cast together for the ""Best in Show"" competition. This is where Willard, who seems to have wandered in from a slow day at the XFL, delivers his wildly comic commentary, which amazes and befuddles his more serious partner. (For a while, there was actually some Oscar buzz for Willard's performance here.) Though the film pokes fun at the dog show circuit, it also reveals a fondness for the people involved. It may not inspire you to become a dog show person, but it just may have you looking in the classifieds to see when the next real-life show is coming to your town.

Rating: 3.5 stars out of 4

Permalink",False,"This is the only Christopher Guest movie that rivals Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for sheer entertainment value, but somehow never gets near the recognition. The plot surrounds the contestants--dogs--and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dog...OK, it's about a dog show. The owners truly are characters, as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs. That's really all there is to it, but that makes it funny enough.

You'd never be able to convince me that a mock-u-mentary about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's house on TV...but that's really all it takes to convert any doubters. Spinal Tap was non-stop hilarity, joke after joke whereas Best in Show was had a few more lulls (and by that I mean say 3 minute at MOST where something riotously funny doesn't happen), but the big laughs are even bigger.

The casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in, uh movies in general Parker Posey does a fine job. In fact, her tirade directed at Ed Begley Jr. and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the film.

What's amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot, simple as it was, around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction. I guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot. Everyone's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely over-the-top. The realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman. I actually encounter wierdos like this now and then. If you like Guest's stuff at all, you should definitely own this one."

Permalink",False,"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. However, I have laughed harder at plenty of movies. This is because Best In Show's brilliance lies not in slapstick or one-liners, but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit. The improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke, but only until after several jokes build on one another, each disarming your senses until the jokes climax and you can't help letting loose.

It's a well-shot film, but what makes it extraordinary is the acting. I was impressed on my first viewing, but when I watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised, I was amazed. It was thoroughly enjoyable to see the comedians work off each other, build jokes out of nothing, and completely immerse themselves in their characters.

I imagine the golden days of Second City were like this.

Permalink",False,"In the era of the Farrelly Brothers and the Jackass series, to have a movie made and performed by Americans come out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is well-nigh miraculous. This ensemble has been behind some other efforts, most recently ""A Mighty Wind"" which was so subtle it seemed to be an actual documentary without the overlay of entertainment, but ""Best In Show"" hits on all cylinders. It is superbly cast with some of the best of current US actors, Parker Posey, who exudes energy even when she stands still, Eugene Levy as tolerant everyman who is nobody's doormat, even when he appears to be (or maybe, 'indomitable doormat'). The brilliant stylings of Fred Willard, the understated performances of so many others, which is a characteristic not normally associated with Americans or American actors. One of the few humorous movies I can watch again and again.

Permalink",False,"Right before turning in, the girlfriend said that if I was still up working into the wee hours I should take a break and turn on the telly. Best in Show would be on and although she hadn't seen it, she'd heard it got great reviews.

I kept working and forgot the time. The telly was on but I ignored it. All of a sudden I began hearing this very weird dialog. 'We like the same things - soup, snow peas, talking - and not talking.' I thought to myself 'what is this - some kind of weird porn movie?' And I continued ignoring it for a while longer until I heard the voices of Levy and Begley Jr. It was then I remembered what the girlfriend had said.

I looked the movie up at the IMDb quickly and was surprised to see who was behind it: Christopher Guest aka Nigel Tufnel, the man with the extra loud guitar amplifier. I knew then I was lucky to still be awake to witness this one.

I made two more checks at the IMDb before getting back to the movie: the number of awards and nominations and the box office. Not surprisingly this was a low budget venture, and not surprisingly either it's garnered tonnes of awards and nominations. The studio made a profit off this one, but it's pocket change in comparison to the big blockbusters. Still, it must be a kind of Woody Allen and Orion kind of thing: movies like this make the studio look good.

On to the movie: it's a riot, a bloody riot. It might not be your cuppa, but then OK - turn it off or watch something else. But there is so much in this one - it plays a bit like an Altman. Lots of hand-held too. And when you finally get to the show itself on comes Fred Willard and takes it away. He uses Jim Piddock as a foil - actually he uses almost everything as a foil. And if you think his portrayal is too much over the top, reflect on the fact it's supposedly a copy of an actual commentator at shows of this kind.

This type of movie is either extraordinarily difficult or admirably easy to make, and I suspect it's a bit of both. Some of the skits are just too much, and everywhere you turn the acting is inspired. One scene with I believe Posey in a pet shop is precious - and not only her work but the shop assistant's. Amazing stuff.

Mostly my sympathies went to Begley Jr who was the receptionist at the hotel. Meeting all these weird types and trying to remain accommodating and representative - it must be difficult if not impossible. There are some very weird characters in this one.

And you may be asking yourselves 'watch a mockumentary about a dog show and its participants?' And that's the whole point - it's hilarious; it's a riot.

I give it an 11."

Permalink",False,"Before the lights went out and the movie Best in Show began, the representative from Warner Bros. asked the audience two questions: ""Any Spinal Tap fans?"" and ""Any dog fans?"" The audience responded affirmatively in both instances, and such began the movie. If you answer yes to both of these questions, this is a must-see movie. If you answered no, you should still see this satirical romp following the actions of the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. The director, writer and star of Best in Show, Christopher Guest, is no newcomer to fake documentaries. As the lead guitarist in the aforementioned This Is Spinal Tap (1984) and the director, writer and star of Waiting for Guffman (1997), he is perhaps the master of the field, exploring a common theme, as reflected in the Guffman tag line: ""There's a good reason some talent remains undiscovered."" Guest explores this theme further in Best in Show, looking at ordinary people not mockingly but almost tenderly. You understand the characters' fears and insecurities, and you can only see too much of people you know or yourself in them. More importantly, you like these characters. When Eugene Levy's character Gerry Fleck reacts to his wife Cookie's (Catherine O'Hara) past wild sex life, you know that this is a man who loves his wife and whom his wife loves, despite his huge dorkiness and her having slept with almost every man they meet. ""Pookie and I work as a team,"" he says, and they do, singing in harmony about their beloved terrier. The other characters are as banal and human as they can be; the braces-wearing yuppie couple, played with aplomb by Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock, take their dog to a therapist because the dog is depressed and angry about having seen the couple in the Congress of the Cow Kama Sutra position. They wax poetic about having been ""raised amongst catalogues,"" extolling the virtues of J. Crew and L.L. Bean, and describe their similarities as loving ""soup, outdoors, snowpeas, talking and not talking."" These two are perhaps the most caricaturistic and one-dimensional of the characters in the film, but you feel sad for them for their transference of parental instinct onto their woeful dog. Best in Show has its share of comedic highs, most notably, the interplay between Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), the hopelessly clueless commentator, and Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock), the British dog expert. As Buck barrages Trevor with inane and hilarious questions, Trevor brings up the most specific detail about the different breeds and the particular judges. Buck reminds me of my Uncle Bob, the man who doesn't know anything about anything but talks about it anyway, and it's perhaps the funniest part of the movie. This movie is kind to its characters while making fun of them, and the result is hilarity. While I'm curious about the new Tim Meadows' vehicle The Ladies Man, this is the most original and, arguably, the funniest comedy out right now."

It follows several contestants of the Mayflower Dog Show and their dogs.

Other contenders include Michael McKean, Michael Hitchcock, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Parker Posey and in a exceptional effort as a man with 2 left feet, Eugene Levy (he also co-wrote the script with Guest).

Permalink",False,"You know, this movie reminded me so much of so many people I know, I think that's the reason why I loved this movie so much. I was just on the floor laughing because this had such a serious and document feel to it, but the dialog is so hilarious, that you can't help but have a good time. Basically the movie is about these crazed dog owners who are competing in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best. Whlie it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously, it turns out the owners are just as insane. Megan, one of the dog owners, goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special bee squeaky toy for her dog.

There is another couple that is just great, Gerry and Cookie, this complete nerd and attractive woman that are just so lovable. In the beginning of the movie, Gerry describes how many boyfriends Cookie had. Throughout the movie, her ""lovers"" see her and hit on her even in front of Gerry! It was just great and fun to watch Gerry's looks. This whole movie is just a hoot, and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up. It's a great movie is just fun to watch, I'd highly recommend it! Now, I have to find a nice way of showing this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves. :D

Permalink",False,"This movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history. Its cousins A mighty wind, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are terrific in their own right but Best in Show takes the cake.

A movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs competitively, it's the intricacies of the characters that make it so good. After watching the movie about 75 times I have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film. There is very little interaction between any of the ""groups"" of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film.

If you watch this movie and don't find it as funny as I am billing it as, watch it again. The first time I saw it I thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious. It is a film that grows on you. Defininatly a movie that you will find yourself quoting frequently.

Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A+ if you get the DVD check out how these characters were ""born"" amazing that these two could hit it so on the head. And to find out that they really didn't go by a script and sort of made it up as they went.

Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: A Cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the Cookie character. Gerry (Eugene Levy) delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half.

Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan- A+ Find me a funnier character than Scott Donalan, I DARE YOU! He will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was very good as well and they interplay here (and a brief appearance with the Gugglemans) goes to show why he is always in these films. A great actor with razor like wit.

Harlan Pepper- B+, I don't want it to seem like he isn't funny, he sure is but being the only ""Solo"" act he can't be quite as funny as the others above. He does use the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies going for him.

The rest are all great as well, there is no weak character. See this film at least twice. Buy it, you will not regret it."

Permalink",False,"This is the best of the films (so far) that Christopher Guest has created using his very talented ensemble cast. Previously, they'd made the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and following BEST IN SHOW, they made the very enjoyable A MIGHTY WIND. As for their latest, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, the less said the better.

The film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. You follow these few chosen dogs from pre-show preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious ""Mayflower Kennel Club"". However, none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. Amazingly, even though the characters are rather outlandish, there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodying--as decades ago I had some experience with dog shows and this is a VERY cutthroat group of people! My favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility. I also loved the openly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and clever. However, the best performance probably wasn't from any of the couples but from Fred Willard who played the world's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history. His comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed him as an incredibly stupid person--how he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyone's guess. The other contestants featured were also quite funny--the high-priced professional poodle handler and its rich owner, the country boy and his hound as well as Winkie's ""parents"" who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the show.

Despite the improvised style of film making, the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story--one that is NOT for dog owners only. Exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. Clever and consistently funny.

By the way, try to find this on DVD as the extras were actually worth seeing. While a bit painful to watch, I loved seeing Harlan Pepper and his beach ball collection in particular!"

Permalink",False,"Best in Show is a delightful comedy, a pseudo-documentary about dog lovers and their dogs. The characters themselves are delightful, both human and canine. The comedy varies from very subtle to obvious but never becomes ridiculous. Many things will not be noticed on the first viewing. This is one of those films that can be trotted out frequently and still be as funny as ever. The film was written by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy who also star in it; Guest directed it. They and much of the cast were also in Waiting for Guffman. The cast consists predominantly of improv comedians from Second City, National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live. The scene concepts were planned but there were no rehearsals; the actors improvised the dialogue, resulting in very spontaneous interaction between the characters. The actors could plan things that they wanted their characters to say but they might not get the chance to use much of what they planned; it all depended on what the other characters would say. Different takes of the same scene could be completely different. Over sixty hours of film were taken and the editing took about eight months. The film culminates in the big Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. There are two commentators: one, Trevor Beckwith (British actor Jim Piddock, who was required to study everything that he could about dogs and dog shows), is an expert on dogs and the local, Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard, who was instructed to learn nothing about dogs), obviously knows nothing about dogs except, perhaps, that they have four legs and two genders; they interacted with great hilarity. Three of the five dog show judges were actually show dog judges; the other two were actors. Most of the dog handlers in the show were not actors. The film is one of the funniest that I have ever seen; when I was not laughing, I was at the edge of laughter."

This humor is not for everyone. IT's rather subtle and not too physical, so some people may not relate. However, as a dog lover (and a dog show fan), I loved this movie. There are so many funny lines in it! My daughter and I quote them to each other often. I find it amazing that these people can ad lib so much funny material for each movie!

Permalink",False,"After watching ""Best In Show"" my first question was, ""Why did so many rate this movie so highly?"" My wife walked out after 10 minutes. In a fit of generosity I gave it a ""6"" of 10, only after I viewed the DVD version with the director's commentary turned on.

The director and co-writer is Christopher Guess, who also stars as Harlan Pepper, a country bumkin who is showing his bloodhound, and studies ventriloquism on the side. The other co-writer is Eugene Levy who stars as Jerry Fleck, who meets up with another of his wife's ex-lovers almost everywhere they go. Jerry as two left feet, literally.

To say the movie was ""written"" is a bit of a stretch because, as Guess and Levy explain, all scenes and dialog were improvised, with no rehearsals. Except for Parker Posey, who plays the out-of-control housewife, all the actors are veterans of improvisation, and most have worked together in other movies. The whole film has the feel of ""improvisation"", and the look of a hand-held home movie, but with better sound. Instead of using selective focus to isolate the subject, almost everything is in focus in most scenes.

Fred Willard was the most entertaining. Many of us have seen him regularly in comic skits on the Jay Leno late night TV show. He was one of the two announcers at the dog show, and his questions and comments never fit, but were funny because of that. ""How do they get those Scnauzers to become minature? Do they shrink them? Do you know they eat dogs in some cultures? That judge, examining the dog's testicles, I would be uncofortable on a date with her!""

The dog show brings forth the gay couple, the quarreling couple, the March/December couple, and so forth. After ""best in show"" is picked, and everyone goes their separate ways, the short epilog shows how the show influenced them and what they did afterward. The funniest was the calendar the gay couple were making, showing two dogs posed as various famous movie characters.

Why do I think this is a mediocre movie? It is obviously a vanity project. Guess and Levy apparently said, let's make a comedy with lots of funny people and sight gags, let's use improvisation, and use a dog show in Philadelphia as a reason for following the lives of all these ""fringe"" personalities. I found it entertaining for the most part, but also found Parker Posey's acting to be too much ""over the top"", and found myself cringing instead of laughing. Too many of the ""gags"" came across as forced humor. While I admire the project, having made many home movies myself when my children were growing up, overall the effort misses the ""entertainment"" mark of a major film."

Permalink",False,"Director Christopher Guest has spent the past twenty years of his career working on an ever-growing list of comedic ""mockumentary"" features on varying topics. Farcical and amusing misadventures presented as ""real life"" documentaries, starring some of the best minds in comedy working today. This is somewhat appropriate, as the film that arguably made him a star was the fantastic ""This is Spinal Tap"", which he co-starred in, in addition to co-writing. From the amusing and quirky ""Waiting for Guffman"", to the surprisingly heartfelt ""A Might Wind"", Guest's films have been consistently hilarious and have maintained a frankly shocking degree of freshness through the years.

While individual tastes vary between fans, and while everyone has their own personal favorite Guest film, I know I'm certainly in no minority to feel that the greatest achievement of his career is the incredible and frankly brilliant 2000 release ""Best in Show."" A film I feel is amongst the most underrated and under-appreciated comedies of all time. Sure, it does have a fan- base, but even still... it's a film that is so unique and so special, that it deserves a far greater audience and far more recognition that it currently receives from its moderate but very dedicated cult audience.

It's time again for the annual Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show, a prestigious dog-breed competition held in Philedelphia. The ""documentary"" follows a varied and very peculiar collection of contestants as they prepare to depart for their show with their beloved canines. Among them are Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara), a friendly and seemingly average middle- class couple who hope their terrier has what it takes; Harlan Pepper (director Guest), a southern man with a pronounced drawl who raises bloodhounds and has some interesting aspirations; Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock)- the most stereotypical upper-class yuppie- hipsters you could ever imagine; camp gay couple Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof (John Michael Higgins, Michael McKean) and their Shih Tzu and Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy trophy-wife and two- time winner of the competition.

A film made heavily through improvisational comedy and a clever, high-concept hook, ""Best in Show"" is such a wild success thanks to the incredible cast of performers assembled, and the delightfully bizarre characters they cultivate. From the pretentious Swan duo losing their minds over a squeaky toy by the name of ""Busy Bee"", to the delightful interactions between Donlan and Stefan, and certainly to the pure and very relatable giggles the average-seeming Flecks bring about... everyone is at the top of their game creatively, supplying some of the best subtle (and not-so-subtle at times) humor I've ever seen. Director Guest skillfully pulls out non-stop moments of charm and laughs from the amazing cast, and puts together one heck of a show.

Though the film's appeal may be lost on those looking for a more general joke-a-minute-riot, ""Best in Show"" encapsulates many of the best instances of clever comedy to emerge in recent memory. It's a film more about delivering smirks and chuckles than out-loud belly- laughs, where quirky characters and oddly personal stakes take center stage and the plot often takes an overt back seat. The great fun of the film is seeing people who feel like they could very well exist, even if they are exaggerated for comedy, in a situation that's just odd enough that the average person would find it fascinating. It's about people first and foremost... it's about the men and women behind the dogs. And how the show is more about them than the canines on display.

""Best in Show"" is in my mind one of the greatest comedies of all time. It's clever. It's entertaining. It's enthralling and charming. And it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10. Sit! Stay! And prepare to laugh!"

Permalink",True,"This movie brought together some of the old Spinal crew for another mockumentary film, this time revolving around the world of the Dog Show, how their owners prepare and train for the show before moving on to the show itself.

We meet several teams as they hope to win the top prize- The Fleck's, Cookie who seems to have slept with every man ever, and Gerry who tries to cope with his wife's old escapades and the fact that he literally has two left feet. Harlan, whose dog talks to him, and enjoys ventriloquism. The Swan's who have taken far too much coffee and scream at each other. Donalan and Vanderhoof the gay couple, and Cabot and Cummings who have won the last two years. Fred Willard commentates on the show, and is very funny as always. Funny scenes include the 'Look at me!' scene, and any with Levy. Unfortunately some of the best scenes were deleted or filmed later- Willard interviewing Leslie Cabot, and the alternative epilogue with Gerry is one of the funniest things i have ever seen. If these had been included, i would give the film an extra mark. But...

And what can you say about Fred Willard and Eugene Levy...

It's a mockumentary about a dog show and a bunch of wacky dog owners. Don't expect to be moved in some epiphanatical (I might have just made up a word) way after watching this movie, but if you just let yourself get caught up in the absurdity, you'll probably have a few good laughs.

Permalink",False,"Considered by many who have watched all three of Christopher Guest's ""mockumentary"" films as his funniest, ""Best In Show"" is guaranteed to evoke a number of laughs and offend someone.

This is a typical modern-day comedy meaning that sex jokes dominate and there is both a gay and lesbian ""couple."" So, if you've heard this is about dog shows, don't rush out and rent this and watch it with the kiddies. It is anything but family fare.

Yet, despite all the sleaze factor - and there is a lot of it - I still found this ""charming,"" for some reason. The laughs range from crude to subtle and the characters who enter their dogs in professional shows are really the subject of exaggerated ridicule here: from Yuppies to gay men to redneck hunters to dog trainers to nerdy types to whatever. No one pictured in this movie is a healthy, normal person. Everyone is ""whacked"" to some degree, except the announcer. However, his sidekick, the color man (played by Fred Williard) is brutal!

The message, obviously, is that some people just take their pets a little too seriously!"

Permalink",False,"Functioning as a sort of midpoint between ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""A Mighty Wind"", ""Best in Show"" portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate. Some are weird, some crazy, and otherwise, but they all make the movie good. Director Christopher Guest is particularly funny as gay Harlan Pepper, very much trying to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara, and Bob Balaban also do great jobs (I can't imagine them not doing great jobs, at least not in a Christopher Guest movie). As someone who's never attended a dog show, this movie is my main exposure to them. They sure look neat.

Permalink",False,"I have read several of the bad reviews, and some of them say this movie has a really bad script. Those people are WRONG. The dialogue is hilarious, but the beauty of it is, there is no script. This movie is entirely improv.

Any way, this movie follows five teams hoping to win the Mayflower Kennel Club Best in Show award. There's Harlan Pepper (Guest) a redneck from Florida and his bloodhound. There are Meg and Hamilton Swan (Posey and Hitchcock,) a yuppie couple who are obsessed with their dog. There are Cookie and Gerry Fleck (Levy and O'Hara,) who love their terrier. There are Sherry Cabot and Christy Cumming (Coolidge and Lynch), one of whom is a gold digger and the other is a trainer for the poodle. Lastly, there are Stephen Vanderhoof and Scott Donlan (McKean and Higgins) who play gay lovers who own shih tzus. They all want to win the top prize, but who will truly win? From there, the mayhem is out of control. The jokes in this movie are great. From a kid who wants to strap a toy parachuter to the terrier and throw it off the shed, to a man with two left feet, to Buck Laughlin (Lilard) that steals the show with his unknowledge about dogs. This movie is flat out hilarious. If you can, get the DVD because it has great deleted scenes. 10/10 Rating: Couple talking about their dog watching them ""mate,"" gay scenes (not extreme) and some language."

Permalink",False,"So who was the ""Best in Show?"" Was it the incredibly neurotic Meg Swan (Parker Posey). I mean, can you believe how she went ape over that bee toy? Can you believe that she or that husband of hers (Michael Hitchcock) should ever be allowed to own a dog?

How about Gerry (Eugene Levy) and Cookie (Catherine O'Hara)? I was just cracking up over how he had to deal with her promiscuous past.

Then, there is Scott (John Michael Higgins) and Stafan (Michael McKean). Naturally, they would own the Shih Tzus. Scott's costumes were too much, but they were supposed to be. I cracked at the line: What Shih Tzus need rescuing anyway? You don't see Shih Tzus straggling around the streets in an old coat ""help, alms for the poor"".

The repressed lesbian, Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge) and her new partner Christy (Jane Lynch), who said, ""The heart and the soul which was what my mom did, that was her role, she was there for the unconditional love and it worked for my family, you know... until my mom committed suicide in '81.""

Or, was it Harlan (Christopher Guest), who looked just like his dog. Do people still do ventriloquism?

Best in Show? It goes to Buck (Fred Willard). He was a hoot, and he didn't even have a dog!

You can be sure that I will be watching the other mocumentaries to see these actors again."

Permalink",False,"""Best in Show"" is a mocumentary on dog shows, brought to us by the same team that made the classic ""Spinal Tap"" We follow several groups of dog handlers as they prepare their dogs for the biggest dog show in the country. They are all pretty stereotypical dog owners (in that they are eccentric and self obsessed), but all very different.

The second half of the movie is the dog show, where the movie kicks into overdrive, thanks largely to the commentary of Buck Laughlin, played by the brilliant Fred Willard. He seems to be a frustrated ex sports commentator who is now resigned to the lower rating ""sports"". He knows nothing about dogs and bumbles through by asking dumb questions, making poor analysis and adding some sexual innuendo. Just awesome.

Very well written, excellent cast and plenty of laughs.

Permalink",True,"From director/writer Christopher Guest (one of the band members in This Is Spinal Tap, and acting in the film), and co-writer (and actor) Eugene Levy (American Pie), this is an interesting comedy with a hardly interesting contest, but it does actually become fun. Basically an array of characters from all walks of life, and all as unusual as each other, are preparing their dogs for the 25th Annual Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. A film crew is filming all individual contestants, and the judges, including Harlan Pepper (Guest), Gerry Fleck (Levy) along with his admirer Cookie Fleck (Home Alone's Catherine O'Hara), Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean), Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins), Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (American Pie's Jennifer Coolidge) and Buck Laughlin (American Pie: The Wedding's Fred Willard). There are some giggly moments of dialogue, and small gross or silly comedy, and the winner of the contest is almost obvious, but worth it. It won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 44 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments, and it was number 30 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Good!

What we're left with is a fitfully funny, faux behind-the-scenes look at dog competitions with characters that lack the authenticity of the small-town performers in ""Guffman"" and the washed-up metalheads of ""Tap""--these people (down to Eugene Levy's 2 left feet and Parker Posey's braces) smack of artificiality. While the film is funny and ultimately satisfying for fans of Guest's observational brand of humor, I found myself smiling more than laughing at ""Best in Show.""

Permalink",False,"BEST IN SHOW (2000) ***1/2 Christopher Guest, Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock, Eugene Levy, Catherine O' Hara, John Michael Higgins, Michael McKean, Patrick Crenshaw, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, Bob Balaban, Don Lake, Jim Piddock, Fred Willard, Ed Begley, Jr., Larry Miller.

Christopher Guest is fast becoming one of the best mockumentary filmmakers with his latest triumph, a pointed take at dog show contestants and their addled owners.

The setting is the annual Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show in Philadelphia which brings together some very memorable characters for competition. Included are in no particular order, all equally funny: Meg and Hamilton Swan (Posey and Hitchcock), the most obnoxious WASPs ever satirized on the big screen, whose `baby' Beatrice, is a purebred Weimaraner they dote on including extensive psychotherapy thanks to their dog witnessing their sexual antics; Gerry and Cookie Fleck (co-writer Levy and O'Hara, `SCTV' alums) who have unique characteristics as well: he literally has two left feet and she an apparent sexual history to rival Wilt Chamberlain, and their prized Norwich terrier Winky; gay couple Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins - best known as David Letterman in HBO's telepic `The Late Show', and Guest's fellow `Spinal Tap'per partner in crime McKean), NYC hair salon stylists and their Shih Tzu they adore if not more than themselves; Leslie Ward Cabot and his decades younger trophy wife Sherri Ann (veteran character actor Crenshaw best remembered for his recurring appearances on tv's sitcom `Alice' and Coolidge, the sexy mom in `American Pie'), a buxom Anna Nicole Smith manque, whose standard poodle is represented byaward-winning handler Christy Cummings (Lynch eerily echoing Anne Heche), as a competitive not-so-secret lesbian lover of the bodacious and vacuous Sherri Ann; and finally Guest himself as the drawling North Carolina bred good ol' boy and fly fishing shop proprietor Harlan Pepper, sporting the most unusual shade of burnt sienna hair not unlike a Crayola and his beloved bloodhound, Hubert, who also shares a predelection for ventriloquism.

Along the way Guest allows his very talented cast of actors to improvise their way into uncharted hilarity skillfully skewering the vacant, pompous and ridiculous extents people will take to preen over their pets (like his previous films, Guest outlines a script rather than provide extensive dialogue and it clearly is his forte) oblivious to their grotesqueries.

There are so many side-splitting scenes from cuckolded Levy constantly being bombarded by frank sexual talk about his betrothed (particularly in a stop over to O' Hara's numerous exes, memorably played by a horny Miller); the anal retentive hotel manager portrayed by Begley (who accomodates from one extreme to the other but ultimately on the hygenic ways his staff will go to at lengths whenever the dog show is in town); to the flamboyant double entendres tossed by Higgins and his flashy clothing (8 count 'em 8 silk komonos for a 48 hour stint!). But hats off to Willard who steals the show as the event's color commentator Buck Laughlin whose inept improvisatory will have you laughing out loud and reveling on the nice riff he does of all those doofus sports announcers who think they know everything and kudos to his straight-man Piddock as Trevor Beckwith, who manages to implode with dignity.

Easily one of the funniest films of this year or in any year and it's always a pleasure to have a most welcome Guest as the host to showcasing limited talent so eloquently."

Permalink",True,"Doesn't matter. We are not talking ""mocumentary"" here. Christopher Guest remarked after making the first of his many wonderful satires, that if THIS IS SPINAL TAP were nothing but mockery, the film would have been over in fifteen minutes. And he was right. In BEST IN SHOW, Guest (and writing pal Eugene Levy) struck a kind of comic apotheosis; they don't mock AKC-type shows at all, but they have a wonderful time dishing up a fictional set-in-Philadelphia dog show to show the many off-center but All-American type dog owners and their interaction. Fred Willard plays the TV color man, whose every remark strives for wit but bespeaks a deep, deep ignorance of the topic (""The sporting dogs; those are the 'jocks' of the dog world, aren't they?"")

Perhaps it's Guest's British origin that gives him the required comic distance to craft a view so wonderfully skewed as in BEST IN SHOW. Certainly his many years in the USA give him great comic insight into the type of people whose foibles ""play"" in a movie. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are the Swans, a couple of shrill perfectionist yuppies from suburban Chicago. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hare are the Flecks, a very typical middle-class couple from Ohio except that he has two left feet and she has round heels (a running joke in the film, as she is forever running across past lovers, to hubby's consternation). The ever-funny Jane Lynch plays a lesbian kennel owner with an eye for a rich man's wife (Jennifer Coolidge). Michael McKeon and John Michael Higgins are gay beauty-salon operators; the McKeon character could pass for straight but when Higgins' flames, he is a holocaust. And best of all, C. Guest himself plays Harlan Pepper (love that name!), a molasses-mouthed, low-key North Carolina hunter.

All I can do is sketch the players and open the way to the real treat of this movie: the comic dialog, much of it improvised. I would rather not deal with that here, because the lines and their delivery are the real spoilers and the reason this film transcends mere sketch humor and becomes something of a study in tragi-comic American types. Highly recommended. If you think American movie comedies have gone to the dogs, try this one; it's full of canines but there isn't a ""dog"" to be found anywhere in BEST IN SHOW!

This cute lampooning of the complete dog lover looks at a handful of stereotypes (gays, yuppies, a good old boy, etc.) and their pooches as they prep for, converge on, and participate in a dog show spectacle.

Permalink",False,"The world of dog shows is ripe for the picking, when it comes to mocking your subject and the characters that inhabit it's rings. But that is not really what Christopher Guest has ever done.

I watched this to remind myself what I love about this style of film. The characters develop naturally, by shedding layers of pretense when they ""don't know we are watching"" and suddenly pulling themselves together in a vain attempt to convince the viewer that we just caught them at a bad moment. It's a brilliant way to show us the lives of people on a mission. When you allow yourself to forget that you are watching a movie, and plunge into the documentation of these people's lives, you experience the sheer joy of being in on the joke, through the eyes of the camera crew. The behind the scenes workers who toil away on big budget films, and get to see the reality behind the surreal world of personas and personalities. Guest takes us deep into the lives of the ordinary person, who is trying to live an extraordinary life. This time, they do it through the dogs they own, or show.

They have dreams, and delusions, but the one thing you feel with Guest, that I appreciate now more than ever, is that he genuinely enjoys the human condition. He likes people. He cares about his audience, and he is in on the joke with us. We are not the butt of the joke, and we are never insulted for loving Dog Shows, Community Theater, or even the Rock Stars in a giant arena. Everybody loves a show, or to be a part of the show. NOT everybody gets to be a big star. To be the winner. To be noticed for what they feel is their unique gift or talent. Rather than exploit that, and ""mock"" it in a cruel and unfunny fashion, Guest reminds us that within our little circle, and in our own ways, we can all feel like stars. And it nobody has to get hurt in the process. I watched this film, in part, to recover from what I felt was an abysmal failure to make a Mockumentary style film about writers. Authors Anonymous. It fails where Guest shines. There are people acting their hearts out in old citrus warehouses, and others are packing up their RV's to head out to another dog show. These life stories, and their sometimes absurd details, make for hopeful films that salute the human spirit.

The spirit of competition is a theme Guest tackles with grace, and a divine objective ""everyone can be a star"" sensibility that pays homage to our desire to feel special, and rewards it at times, in the most delightful fashion. The underdog. That is what he brings us time and again, in new forms. This time, with actual dogs in the mix! Mock umentary should mean ""mocking the style of the documentary film"" Not mocking the people who are the subject of the film Even when the film is about insufferable boobs. We learn enough about them to begin to understand what makes them tick, what holds them together, and what causes them to come unglued. We end up caring.

Dog Shows are silly, but the people are far more complex. Dog shows are filled with pretentious snobs, in ""real life"" Easy prey. Not so easy to make a movie that works, much less can make us root for these people on any level, but he did it again. And is it ever fun to watch."

Permalink",False,"While not as brilliant or as quotable as This Is Spinal Tap, writer/actor/director Christopher Guest's character driven mockumentary Best In Show-which is centred on the world of dog shows-still has plenty of wonderful, well-observed moments of dry wit, and is one of those films that I believe can only improve with repeat viewings.

The film owes much of its success to its superb cast: Guest plays Harlan Pepper, redneck owner of a prize bloodhound; Eugene Levy is superb as buck-toothed Gerry Fleck, husband to Terrier owner Cookie (Catherine O'Hara), who has been around the block a lot more times than her dog; Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey are the neurotic yuppie owners of a pampered Weimaraner; Jennifer 'Stifler's Mom' Coolidge plays Sherri, rich owner of a champion poodle, while Jane Lynch plays her lesbian dog trainer; and Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins play a camp gay couple who are showing their Shih Tzu. Meanwhile, Fred Willard shines as the hilariously un-PC co-host of the dog show, whose every remark is a howler.

7/10, but this rating may well go up in the future."

Permalink",False,"No dogs were harmed during the making of this film. In fact, never has there ever been a film where dogs stayed so stoic in the face of a ton of foolishness. Best in Show, while on the surface a Christopher Guest mockumentary about competitive dog owners and over-the-top prestigious dog pageants, makes a particular comment on humans in comparison to animals. The humans make stupid decisions, overreact at things that don't matter, argue, scream and fight tooth and claw to win the blue ribbon, while the Dogs sit peacefully, seemingly unaware, or totally aware and choosing to ignore it.

Best in Show is a hilarious movie. The entire time, I had a big smile on my face. Guest has a knack for taking average situations and dissecting every peculiar aspect to poke fun of. He also knows the effortlessly unique qualities of middle Americans and how funny they actually are. Yes, these are seasoned improv comics portraying middle Americans, but in everyday life, you've seen these kind of people before. Take for instance, Harlan Pepper (played by Christopher Guest), a southerner who owns a fishing bait/tackle shop and talks incessantly about what he knows including every kind of nut in existence. Or, how about my personal favorite, the Flecks. Cookie Fleck (played by Catherine O'Hara) is the dutiful wife of Gerry Fleck, whose apparently slept with hundreds of men, quite literally, in fact, every man who comes in contact with her recognizes her. Her husband, Gerry Fleck (played by Eugene Levy) is the perpetual cuckold with two left feet, big bucked teeth and midwestern ""aw-shucks"" sensibility that everyone around him, especially his own wife, takes advantage of. Eugene Levy is the runaway stealer of the entire show. He's laugh-out-loud funny without even trying to be. He's the most natural improv comic in that he's entirely real in his delivery and knows how to react to awkward situation as we all would.

Best in Show is less about the dog's competing, as it is about the people. Guest puts them on display for us to decide who receives the blue ribbon. But dog lovers won't be disenfranchised, as the film proudly displays it's affection for these perfect creatures and how they never leave the side of their owners no matter how flawed they might be."

Permalink",False,"If you want good comedy and a chance to see the funny interaction of people and their dogs, you must watch this. The portrayal of the owners is so cliché as it matches the idea some people may have already established about how far people will go in their treatment of their pet. Of course, the dogs are portrayed as ""normal"" while the personality of the owners is on the borderline of obsessed. Very entertaining and a great movie for the whole family. It will bring a smile to your face!

Besides being a movie about dogs at a dog show, it focuses on the personality of the owners and their crazy lives, which are embellished to the point of comic ridiculous.

Great for the whole family.

Permalink",False,"""Waiting for Guffman"" may just be my favorite comedy of all time; hardly a scene goes by without a dozen hilarious little lines and moments. It would, therefore, have given me nothing but pleasure to report that ""Best in Show,"" the first of Christopher Guest and ensemble's attempts to recapture the blissfully goofy chemistry of that earlier effort, was a rousing success. Unfortunately it's not. There are quite a few amusing moments, but the film never inspired in me much beyond a modest chuckle.

Mostly to blame, I think, is the fact that Guest enlarges his ensemble too much, with the result that no one really has enough screen time to create full characters with personalities of their own. The film feels much more episodic, and the actors even more than in ""Guffman"" play caricatures rather than people.

Still, these complaints will probably only pose a problem -- or at least problems to the same extent -- if you are as much a fan of ""Guffman"" as I am to begin with.

Best in Show was filmed without a script using only ideas to shape the direction of the film. Many takes and hours of footage leave the viewer completely satisfied and laughing out loud.

Each character is finely crafted and unique especially the characters played by SCTV graduates Eugene Levy and Catherine O Hara. This film allows both actors to display their talents.

The film includes all the regular Christopher Guest regulars and is clearly a film that fans of Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman can enjoy.

Permalink",False,"I recently watched ""Best in Show"" on the advice of a few of my friends who thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The flow of the film is very interesting. The beginning is very much like watching a documentary similar to those on cable channels like E! and the end flows more like a traditional motion picture (other than the final interviews, of course). Overall, I can't complain about my viewing experience, which though it seemed to drag at times (like most documentaries do), went by much more quickly and painlessly than I would have thought. The plot and script are pretty predictable, but the storyline follows exactly how it should, however expectable it may be. The dialogue is held together by countless (and hilarious) one-liners that can entice a chuckle out of the audience...even those members who have seen the movie many times. I loved the roles of Hamilton and Meg Swan as well. I think that more than anyone else, they demonstrate how serious some take competitive dog showing. Good, funny flick. Not great, or groundbreaking in any way, but fun to watch and worth a rent. 7 out of 10

Permalink",False,"A true fan of Waiting for Guffman and This is Spinal Tap, I was enthralled to hear of the US release of Best in Show. I deliberately avoided reading advance press, fearing I'd read overmuch into comments and references from other media. Now I almost wish I'd waited for it to come out on DVD. Best in Show was cleverly filmed, but it left me ambivalent about whether I'd lost or invested 1.5 hours.

The banality of the yuppies-mit-braces was pretty surprising. At the end of the film, I didn't believe for a *second* that they'd ever even heard of the Kama Sutra, much less practised it behind unlocked doors. The sum of narcissism, projection and earth tones isn't humor - adding the bland (smug? ""freaked-out""?) weimeraner isn't terribly funny, either.

Where did Leslie go? Wherefore? The sexual politics involved in this relationship are only intermittently provocative or funny. There's an old-ish SNL skit about a Loni Anderson liking soup - if it's come to the point of Christopher Guest offering homage to anything on NBC, I'm sad.

Happily, Guest's caricatures were handled gracefully. The Pine Nut native is treated with dignity, which is rare in a country rife with ""you're a redneck if..."" jokes. A sight gag involving a weird appendage only receives fleeting attention; likewise, Cookie's hoydenish past doesn't seem gratuitous. The gay couples aren't painted with too wide a brush - flamboyance is matched nicely with moments of genuine caring interaction and intelligent interplay.

If you're priding yourself on being edgy, stay home and watch Spinal Tap again. Branch out and rent Pi. If, however, you want a not-too-threatening-periodically-smirking movie to take up a bit of your wallet, go ahead and see Best in Show."

My 16 year old sister, who loves dogs, did not like it at all. Throughout the 90 minute movie she looked at her watch wondering when it would be over.

Permalink",False,"A hard movie not to like. I liked it in large part because of the dogs. And I've finally analysed my vague feeling of dissatisfaction: there aren't enough dogs.

The camera focuses only on the dogs whose owners we follow; even during the competition itself, we have to strain our eyes to catch a glimpse of any others. And the central dogs (shih tsu, bloodhound, Weimeraner, Norwich terrier, and one of those enormous white poodles that have somehow been transformed into toys) scarcely have any personality at all. Bad mistake: the less personality the dogs have, the less their owners have. It's lucky that at least some of the owners have so much anyway. (The best of them is Eugene Levy's Fleck - a gauche yet humane man who isn't so much jealous of his wife's former lovers, as sick to death of running into them.)

I suppose the jokes could have been zinged up a bit, too - making a film out of improvised humour is probably a mistake, even when the improvisations are this good.

It's still funny. Maybe my ""vague feeling of dissatisfaction"" only became worthy of notice when I'd seen it for the third time."

The screaming tense couple, I just hate it when a comedy has these irritants, I just cringe everytime they are focussed on. Catherine and Eugene made the best of their roles, the ongoing bit about her being with just about every man she met was very funny. The handler and the owner were also a good giggle, though you could see the ending of that coming from a mile away. A flimsy piece to pass some time while you multi-task with some other stuff. 6 out of 10.

Generally, I like satires, which this obviously was, too much so. The movie tried to hard to make these people absurd and it was left stale with a mockumentary of cliche caricatures.

Not just because it is a wickedly funny movie, well written, well acted, and well produced, but because it makes fun of one of the most idiotic aspect of our culture, dog shows. It's not that the dog shows themselves are made fun of in Best in Show, it's the people who's entire lives revolve around preening and training their dogs to be show participants. The two characters that stand out as exceptional performances are the oafish announcer, and the guy with, well ... two left feet. Literally! The dogs themselves are great, and probably are overlooked in most reviews. They definitely have personalities of their own, and they seem very normal compared to their handlers - much like the kids who's parents make them endure high profile talent shows.

I found the characterizations in this film to be more often cruel than humorous. Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey are pitiful neurotics whose lives revolve around coffee and their show dog. Eugene Levy is apparently not funny enough for Guest - he wears buck teeth and has two left feet. In the process of getting his dog to the show, the character discovers that his wife (Catherine O'Hara) is the regional slut - not exactly a laugh a minute! Guest himself plays a 'fussy gay' dog owner. I'd recommend this one to people whose sense of humour involves feeling superior to others.

Well I saw it last weekend on TNT... very amusing as they were doing this ""home makeover"" type thing where they were putting all kinds of stuff in someone's backyard for their dogs, and the people on the program were basically just as fake and lame as anyone in the movie. Anyway, fake and lame describes almost every character in this movie with the exception of Guest's startling performance as Harlan Pepper. I feel like in a lot of ways the people being lampooned were played too heavily, especially the yuppie couple with Parker Posey. Their act was very funny at first but it wore thin much too fast for me. Likewise all the jokes about Catherine O'Hara's character being promiscuous. The first was hilarious but they kept pounding it into the ground.

All in all I feel the love for this film is somewhat displaced. I didn't enjoy it as much as ""Waiting for Guffman"" or even the later ""Mighty Wind"". But I've never owned a dog so maybe I'm missing some of the humor.

Permalink",False,"Seeing such a high rating for a comedy on the IMDB, i put this down as one of my movies to watch.

I wish i hadn't.

The whole style, every scene and line of dialogue is deadpan to the extreme. The story basically follows several different owners as they enter a dog show, through to it being won, and then briefly what happens to them after.

The problem is, every character is supremely annoying or dull and that was pretty much the only joke in the film. To me that isn't enough, and in fact the movie regularly annoyed me. I think it got about one laugh, and a couple of smiles throughout, and the rest of the time i was in pain.

If you think the idea of someone reciting a line, sometimes saying something ever so slightly odd, in a matter of fact and totally deadpan way is enough for a supposed comedy, well, you may like it, but i wouldn't class it as humorous in the slightest when done repeatedly for an entire movie. Some scenes don't even have this slight blessing, and consist of the characters just doing something intensly stupid and annoying, with that trait presumably something to find humour in.

You have been warned."

Permalink",True,"More than 18 years after its theatrical release, Best in Show remains one of the top 20 classic ""Mockumentary films"" of our age. The current IMDB user rating of 7.5 clearly contradicts how passionately film fans love and adore this movie. Christopher Guest is a remarkable film maker, not only as a gifted writer (former SNL) and director (Best In Show, This Is Spinal Tap, Waiting For Guffman, Mighty Wind, Mascots, etc.), but also for his spectacular ability to select and retain the kind of acting talent necessary to pull off fast paced films like this. With only a mere 16 pages of actual script, the bulk of the film is hilariously improvised by some of the best comedic talent in the industry. That's saying quite a lot, given the plethora of versatile actors in the theatrical selection pool. Guest is no slouch himself in the acting and improv departments. His entire appearance and accent changes with each film, from ""Heavy Metal Rock God"" to ""Red Neck Camper."" Sometimes Guest is almost unrecognizable in his own films. Best In Show was edited down from more than 60 hours of filming. The end result is a worthy and extremely funny look at people who breed and competitively ""show"" some of the most pampered and well groomed dogs in the world. The magnificent cast runs wild with line after line of beautifully executed improvisation, and it's difficult to say who makes us laugh (or cringe in some wonderfully awkward scenes) the most often. In any case, the camera rolls on. My only complaint with Mr Guest is that he does not produce more of these. Note to Ms. Jaime Lee Curtis (AKA Mrs.Guest) if you are reading this please ask Chris if he's up for another Mockumentary saga, any subject. I'm certain that no matter what he ultimately decides to write and direct will always be well received by fans and newbies alike.

Permalink",False,"'Best In Show (2000)' is a 'mockumentary' that doesn't really let its style get in the way of its story - never being about the making of itself in the meta way a lot of examples of the genre are, for instance. It uses its subtle but sure style to keep its colourful cast of sometimes quite absurd characters framed with a consistently realistic lens. The film is remarkably funny, with many more gags landing than falling short. Though some mention has been made of its supposed 'cruel spirit', I feel that it's satirical in a rather endearing way, taking its bumbling but lovable cast and making them be the deliverers of the comedy rather than necessarily the focus of it. This makes for an entertaining, if simple, tale that is never unexpected in its narrative but is often unexpected in its humour, a wonderfully straight-laced and realist interpretation of an absurdist's dream. 7/10

Permalink",False,"""Best in Show"" doesn't only call out for dog lovers, but for all people alike, as the main focus is a dog show competition, but Christopher Guest handcrafted it into a multilayer satire about how people can go to extreme lengths to win first prize.

The variety of personalities combined with the traditional cast composed of Guest's regular actors made the character development grow almost on its own.

While ""Best in Show"" will not surpass Guest's earlier films or be in a select top of satire films, it's still a decent mock on the behavior of people in a competition.

Permalink",False,"I have been in the dog field since I was a teenager, from the time I was 15, when I started volunteering at the local shelter. I am still a shelter volunteer but now work in the dog grooming industry. Let me tell you, this mockumentary nails the colourful array of people that are in the industry perfectly!

I last saw this movie in the early 2000s and I have to say, it gets better with each viewing. The cast is perfect for the roles of each eccentric who throws themselves in the world of Conformation dog showing, form the handlers, to the owners and to the announcers and host. Of course, I can't leave out the gorgeous dogs who steal each and everyone of their scenes.

Permalink",True,"Christopher Guest could point his camera at almost any group and find absurdity within their ranks. In 1984 he was the lead for the rock band Spinal Tap, who though they were leagues better than they actually sounded. In his self-directed Waiting for Guffman, he turned to a group of delusional, small-town hicks who compared themselves to the Kennedys and had aspirations for Broadway. And here he focuses on a niche group that seems so perfectly ripe for comedy it is a wonder that no one has noticed them before. Anyone who has owned a dog will know that we all get a little weird around them. We adopt a baby-style talk, and address them as if they could understand our every word. The owners who enter their darlings into dog shows take this behaviour a step further, with some hilarious results.

The film, like Spinal Tap and Guffman, is shot in the mockumentary style, with text on the bottom of the screen to introduce us to our peculiar cast, and a faux-haphazard camera that follows behind their every step. Guest is good enough not to simply let the script dictate the laughs - the first scene is a serious therapy session between two couples, talking about the supposed trauma of one of their kids, and only after holding the tension for as long he can does Guest pan over to the bored-looking Weimaraner in the third chair. The swivel is slow and incredulous, mimicking the audience's own disbelief and effectively pulling off the bait and switch. Later when the Flecks joke about Gerry's lack of coordination, they camera just ever so slightly drifts downwards to reveal his two left feet. It's the sort of joke that is dumb and obvious once you've seen it, but through the format Guest forces laughs out of us that have no business being there, by creating a persona behind the camera that is continually exasperated and shaking its head.

The intimacy of the talking head is a huge asset here, because all of the characters are inherently stereotypes. In a conventional film it would be funny enough to observe them from a distance, with all their actions and dialogue pre-planned, but it would eventually be a bit tiring. Guest's format seemingly allows them a chance to defend their reputation, and thus he creates more humour by instead making their attempts collapse into themselves. There is Jennifer Coolidge in her usual blonde bimbo role, as the trophy wife of a near catatonic sugar daddy who can barely even pretend to have similar interests as her husband outside of soup, the outdoors, frozen peas and talking. The Swans are upper-class yuppies, so of course they met in a Starbucks, but they reveal it was actually two different stores across the street from each other (they of course live in a neighbourhood where this is the norm) and are not the slightest bit aware of the ridiculousness of this little detail. One half of the gay couple has already packed six kimonos for a two day trip, so when his partner protests, he realises he may need a few more. And there is Guest himself, lovingly showing off his ventriloquy dummy like a kid on show and tell day.

Best in Show never descends into mean-spirited territory because beyond the gags, we recognise that these character's eccentricities are ultimately channeled through a love for their dogs, however unresponsive the dogs themselves may actually be. When the Swans enter the airport, they push their trolley of luggage along, but they also drag Beatrice's dog crate, which is larger than all their own belongings combined. Later when Meg is desperately trying to find a replacement stripy, squeaky bee toy for her, every attempt of logic on the shop owner's part flies hopelessly past her. They have their own crazed logic; Meg shouts at her husband that Beatrice is not listening to him, not because she is a dog, but because she is freaking out about her lost toy, all while the camera focuses once again on her bored face. The Flecks are likewise obsessed. They sing duets about Terriers with harmonies so bad they end on completely different keys, and their reaction to their baby being held hostage up on a shed roof is as if the world is ending. Eugene Levy has the natural ability to be flustered before it is even appropriate; he starts a sentence, talking about the weather on the drive-up, and has not thought on how to end it (A little cloudy coming up through West Virginia. But once we get into Pennsylvania...it's still, uh, still overcast.""). And of course their card is overdrawn - they are every bit the couple to spend more on their dog than themselves, and we chuckle and love them for it.

Permalink",False,"A keenly observed parody of the wonderful and wacky world of competitive dog showing, this is an absolutely hilarious mockumentary. It has a razor sharp script by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, though I understand that there was quite a bit of improvisation, and the former directs with great style and flair. The film is full to the brim with bizarre, outrageous and over the top characters but I sometimes got the impression that I would meet people like those on display here if I have ever entered my beloved Cocker Spaniel Freddie at a major dog show such as Crufts! It is a great exploration of a very small, insular world.

The film benefits from a brilliant cast of comedic veterans such as Guest, Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Michael McKean, John Michael Higgins, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock, Bob Balaban, Ed Begley, Jr. and Larry Miller. I have to give special mention, however, to Fred Willard who is just on another level of complete and total hilarity as the dog show's co-host Buck Laughlin, who has a serious case of verbal diarrhoea. He devotes much of his energy to insulting the judges and handlers, asking idiotic questions about dogs and their capabilities, telling lewd stories and making tortured baseball analogies. Jim Paddock is a fantastic straight man to Willard as the humourless, straight-laced canine expert Trevor Beckwith, who becomes increasingly exasperated as he is forced to endure more and more of Laughlin's inane prattle."

Permalink",False,"This is Spinal Tap (1984) is in my humble opinion perhaps the greatest comedy film ever made. By making it so good, its creators simply set the bar so high, no one else – themselves included – have subsequently ever been capable of reaching its heights ever again. So it's not really much of a criticism in pointing out that Best in Show is not as good as Spinal Tap. It is a satire on the kind of people who participate in championship dog breeding. The events revolve around a gathering called the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. There isn't really too much of a plot-line here, it's very much a character-driven comedy. It works because the actors in the ensemble cast are all adept at improvised comedy, so it's a film full of little moments rather than a major story arc.

Spinal Tap's Christopher Guest directs as well as acts in this one. He certainly has a feel for the mockumentary genre and has contributed to many of the best ones out there. I would probably describe Best in Show as amusing rather than hilarious though. There are a few laugh-out-loud funny moments though, such as the scene revealing the man with two left feet; while virtually every line uttered by the TV commentator played by the excellent Fred Willard is comedy gold. Truthfully, mixed in with the best material are some more strained jokes. However, as a whole, it works pretty well and the talented cast elevate the material when it falters on occasion. All-in-all, a solidly enjoyable movie."

Permalink",False,"It's another Christopher Guest mockumentary and with a cast full of certified comic geniuses it's hard to see how Guest could go wrong. Look at who Guest has at his disposal: Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Michael McKean, Parker Posey, Fred Willard. Is that enough? No? OK, let's toss in Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Ed Begley, Jr. And of course there's also Guest himself as a key part of the ensemble. These are hilariously funny people. Which makes the fact that this is not a hilariously funny movie a little puzzling. Best in Show is funny but not outrageously so. A funny idea, certainly a funny cast, but not a consistently funny movie. There are a few really funny moments. But the movie ends up producing more wry smiles than big laughs. It leaves you wanting more.

The movie takes place in the rather bizarre dog show world. We focus on five dogs, and their inevitably strange owners, as they make the trek to and ultimately compete in the big dog show in Philadelphia. There's a guy who literally has two left feet and whose wife apparently has slept with every man on the planet. There's a campy gay couple and a neurotic yuppie couple. A trophy wife, married to an oblivious elderly man, and her lesbian dog handler. And an aspiring ventriloquist. All in all a weird bunch. At times perhaps a little too weird for the movie's good. A lot of strange things happen to these strange people. Some of these things are funny but there are a bunch of gags and jokes which fall flat. The movie perks up a bit when we finally get to the dog show itself. That is thanks largely to the presence of Willard who plays perhaps the world's worst television color commentator. He's clearly the funniest thing this movie has going for it. All the other performers do reasonably well but there are times where things just seem a bit off. Maybe the story doesn't quite work, maybe the characters aren't really developed properly. With all these great comic stars you expect hilarity and you don't really get that. The stars do the best they can with the material but you feel that the material let them down a bit. They all have their moments. Posey in particular does really well. And even in a film chock-full of performers with such notable reputations there's room for some lesser-known actors, such as Michael Hitchcock and John Michael Higgins, to turn in good work as well. There's just the sense that director Guest didn't quite pull it all together. This is a movie with such a great cast. That cast could have been put to a little bit better use. Best in Show had such great promise. But just as only one dog can win the trophy not every film is destined for greatness. This film falls a little bit short."

Permalink",False,"Christopher Guest and friends are now making a mockumentary on the dog show circuit. It's a whole bunch of wacky characters with their wacky problems and their wacky life. Everybody is doing a great job. Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins are the gay couple. Catherine O'Hara is married to Eugene Levy with his insane glasses. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are an uptight couple. Jennifer Coolidge is married to an old geezer and Jane Lynch plays her trainer. There is a big problem in this movie. The separate teams have a hard time getting together because they don't really function as a team. They are separate and they stay separate. It limits their interactions and limits the possibility of comedy. It becomes a series of the characters separate and talking into the camera with wacky stories or having a wacky time. It's not until halfway through the movie that the characters start getting together as they prepare for the dog show.

Permalink",True,"The mockumentary form by Christopher Guest: it's something I'm quite fond of - and I've seen a few. This is the second time I've seen 'Best in Show', and this easy going, but filled to the brim with funny little details semi-roadmovie is well worth a watch.

Lots of dialogue, lots of tricky relationships and individuals that are put under the looking glass, and with the clever writing of Guest, they all come up a little or more off, but that's the whole point of it.

Well played by Guest himself (I really thought he must have gone on doing 'The Cleveland Show' after that bit in the woods) and many of the mock-regulars, such as Levy, O'Hara (in 'For Your Consideration' she does a great 'botox', here she wags her leg like no other), Posey, Willard (an imprudent commentator once again) and Coolidge.

Good fun was had by all. 7 out of 10.

Low and behold this is not only written by Christopher Guest (the writer of Spinal Tap), but directed by him as well. And while there really is no story here, the jokes and timing are so spot on that this is too fun not to enjoy, thanks to Guest's writing and the ensemble casts' hilarious performances. Whether you are a dog fan our not, this is one dog show you can go nuts about. Very funny!

Permalink",False,"I'll confess: I've been a fan since 'Guffman'. BIS delivers exactly as you hope it will, and Catherine O'Hara is always a treasure. So let's cut to the downside. In each mockumentary, Guest always takes it a little too far, and kills his own humor. For instance, in 'Guffman', it was absurd that Corky would end up owning a theatrical gift shop in NYC, but even more wrong was the 'Remains of the Day' lunchbox. It's a great joke but it's TOTALLY out of character - Corky would have no idea that this film existed. Just as, here, it is too surreal that a hotel clerk would offer a utility closet to a poor couple. It's not funny because Guest ventures beyond basic reality; aside from the ridiculousness of the clerk going so far to do this, it's insane that hotel liabilities would be overlooked. Yes, I know, this sounds picky, but a funny documentary MUST stay on earth to stay funny. Similarly, Cookie's past sex life is taken way too far, especially in the visit to the old BF. All of this would work beautifully if Guest would just keep his fantasy a little real. But: it's still a pip. See it.

Permalink",True,"This isn't really one of those comedies that makes you crack up, it's one of those comedies that's fun to watch. Fred Willard was the highlight of the film being one of the commentators for the show and made me laugh with every line that came out of his mouth. Every character was defined and fun to watch but I disliked the couple with the braces. They would freak out over everything and it's supposed to be funny, but it really isn't, it just makes you feel bad that the dog has to go through that. The movie had a satisfying ending, where it wrapped everything up with every character. Overall, if you're wanting to see a different kind of comedy or you just want to spend an hour and a half exactly watching something amusing, check it out.

Permalink",True,"Dog shows and the people involved with them would seem like a very inviting target for satire. And this effort by Christopher Guest and pals certainly hits the target, though it isn't quite a bullseye. Best in Show is a ""mockumentary"" about five show dogs and their often eccentric owners competing in what appears to be the Super Bowl of dogs shows in Philadelphia. More often than not it makes you laugh, and it certainly makes you feel sorry for the dogs in these kinds of shows.

Director Christopher Guest plays a redneck owner of an enormous bloodhound from North Carolina. This is obviously a lonely guy with maybe a few too many hobbies. We also see him as a ventriloquist, a guy who can name every kind of nut there is, and he even runs a bait shop. After the competition, he even takes a jaunt to Israel to work on one of those collective farms they have. Other contestants are a pampered standard poodle owned by a trophy wife and trained by her lesbian lover, one of a pair of tiny shi-tzus owed by a flamingly gay couple of guys, a shaggy terrier owned by a borderline white trash couple from Florida, and some other odd kind of dog owned by an annoying yuppie couple. The camera just seems to follow these people and their dogs around while the characters spout mostly improvised dialog as if they were really being interviewed instead of acting. Its good for a lot of laughs.

The redneck and the gay men get most of the laughs. Guest went to great depths to depict his Harlan Pepper character as a man with just too much going on in his own head and too much time on his hands. Michael McKeon and John Michael Higgins are good as the gay men. Maybe a little too good! Jennifer Coolidge (Stifler's mom for those of you American Pie fans) and Jane Lynch have characters that at least keep you guessing for a while about the true meaning of their relationship. I think I recognized the old codger who played Blue in Old School as Coolidge's husband! The film doesn't quite strike gold with the other two dog owning couples, though. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are WAY too over-the-top as the yuppies. They could have been fitfully annoying without the tantrums. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are believable lower income Floridians, but the script overdoes it in ramming the point home about her promiscuity. And their dog seemed the least likely to win. Was this also some kind of joke? 8 of 10 stars.

The Hound.

Mockumentary extraordinaire! Endless pithy witticisms from actor-co-writer-director Christopher Guest, whose troupe includes some really marvelous talent, all of whom get a chance to shine here. Occasionally, the targets are flabby or obvious (lots of 'bitch' jokes and a labored marital spat over a squeeze toy), but otherwise this is right on target. The outré humor which coated Guest's ""Waiting For Guffman"" in 1996 (and had, at times, a sour residue) is toyed with here in a much more loving way. I got the feeling Guest genuinely liked this group of characters better than the ""Guffman"" bunch; and though he does poke and prod at them with his camera--and encourage his actors to go all the way with the material--the nimble editing never wears them out, and the picture does not overstay its welcome. *** from ****

Permalink",False,"If you like a more subtle comedy, this is a great movie for you to watch. It features a wide variety of a bunch of odd characters and a main story situated around a dog-show.

Well, to be honest, there isn't really much story in this movie actually. It's a fake documentary, or mockumentary, focusing on the world of dog-shows and their owners. The first halve of the movie mostly consists out of fake interviews with the characters about them and their dogs, while the second halve concentrates more on the travel to- and the actual dog-show. The movie is not always made credible as a fake documentary because of its way of filming, editing and overall story-telling, so the movie is more stuck somewhere between a mockumentary and just a subtle comedy. Not that this makes the movie any less fun to watch though. It's obvious director Christopher Guest tried to make his own ""This Is Spinal Tap"", a movie and early fake documentary he was involved with previously as an actor, song writer, composer and writer. He also does all of those things in this movie by the way and then some more as well.

It's obvious director and writer Christopher Guest let his actors do a whole lot of improvisation and gave them lots of room to play. At times he just lets the camera role and let the actors do their thing. They come up with with things at times as they just go along. Some of the actors handle this better than the others. I think this is because every actor is itself is very individualistic and want to do things their way, which is not always possible when the actors opposite you is having a monologue concerning the other actor opposite and all you can do is respond to it and just go along with the other actor. Some actors on the other do know how to handle this and go along perfectly with it, such as for instance Eugene Levy. Who must have really enjoyed his improvisations was Fred Willard, as the commentator of the big dog-show. Man, some of the stuff he says is absolute great and hilarious.

The characters and the sort of not everyday and sort of odd background story of a dog-show is what makes this movie work and fun to watch. It's a real subtle sort of comedy that doesn't try to be funny in a forced way but let the actors and characters be the center of the movie its comedy instead, without trying to make them look too funny and more real and humane like, despite all of their oddness's.

It's a fun in-between movie to watch, just like this was a fun in-between movie to make for the actors involved I'll bet.

Permalink",False,"every time I see it! There are many movies that get better with age, as well as, each viewing, but this one takes the cake. I never get sick of this film. Being able to watch it on satellite this evening after a lackluster day only reinforced that fact. Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy have created a cast of eccentric characters that rival any of the Coen brothers' creations. The casting is genius as are the actors' performances. The only thing that 'ruins' this film for me is Fred Willard. His buffoon to Jim Piddock's pained straight man is as sublime a combination as you will see. Fred basically steals the film. I always get angry with myself that I had forgotten to visit the bathroom before getting ensconced to watch and thereby have to waste time later. I could go on and analyze each character and their performance, but I am sure that has been done to death...yadda, yadda, yadda. In short, if you like offbeat, quirky comedies (sorry for the cliché!), watch this film AFTER you go to the bathroom.

Permalink",False,"Although I think I only laughed once, I did find the zany caricatures of people interesting enough to cause me to watch through to the end. If you have seen any other Christopher Guest movies - this is typical of his style.

Basically, the story is about the behind the scenes activities and personalities of a group of dog show competitors. It done in the style of a interview-documentary.

The cast is broad and each set of dog owners has a different storyline going on. The choice of characters represented makes this movie amusing - there's a 40ish blond gold-digger married to the 80+ year old rich guy, an overzealous yuppie couple, an over-the-top gay couple, and more. A rich set of characters and their often embarrassing dialog gives this movie it's edge.

I recommend watching the first 5 minutes of this movie - it's completely representative of the remainder of the show. If you like the style and characters, then you'll enjoy this film.

The movie was made by the characters though. Boy those were some funny characters. Even though I'm not a dog lover or owner, I've seen enough to know that some of those characters were spot on with their antics.

While I'm praising this movie, I would be remiss if I didn't give props to Eugene Levy for co-writing this movie. I didn't check to see if this was his first writing project, but this certainly was a good one for the old resume. Write on Eugene, this was a funny flick.

Permalink",False,"When I sat down to watch this, I really didn't know what to expect, but I had spotted a good bit of small names in comedy on the cast list, so I thought 'what the hey, it might be good'. Turns out I was right. It's a great film, with plenty of commentary on dog lovers and various general issues(there is some great dialog between Eugene Levy and his wife regarding how much she dated before she met him... great stuff). The plot revolves around a dog show, and we see the various characters(read: dog lovers and friends) either going to it or talking about it. The acting is all very good, there really wasn't any performance I found anything less than satisfactory. The characters are well-written, credible and realistic, human. The dialog is real and funny. The dog lover stuff is funny, but possibly slightly clichéd or stereotypical, but never overly so. I know I laughed every time a character talked to or about a dog as if it was a human being that could understand everything it was told, instead of simply an animal that is easily trained. The film is a treat for anyone who thinks animal lovers are somewhat ridiculous and/or any fan of any of the comedians and comic actors in the film. I recommend it to anyone who finds dog lovers particularly amusing and knows of(and enjoys) at least one of the actors in the film. 8/10"

Permalink",False,"Most comedies these days are about obvious jokes, ones that allow time for audiences to laugh, then catch the next one liner. It's fun to see a movie that is much quieter, with sly jokes that seem more genuine than standard written jokes. Best In Show, directed by This Is Spinal Tap star Christopher Guest, who also directed Waiting for Guffman, is an exercise in improve comedy, and that allows for drier wit and more genuine sounding humor. No one-liners for most of the film, just characters who, yes, they are odd, but are harmless. The movie revolves around a series of dog owners, taking their pride and joy to the national championship of dog shows in Philadelphia. The film is presented as a documentary chronically the movements of the participants, so we get back stories and character studies in these people, many of which have interesting aspects. Take the Eugene Levy character (Levy by the way is a co-writer with Guest, which means he either thought of the dog show premise, or the movie's title), Jerry Fleck. Fleck is a big-and-tall salesman who happens to have two left feet, literally. And he's just the tip of the iceberg. Most of the comic performers have backgrounds in sketch comedy, and it pays off in the free-form movie. The most memorable character, probably the only one with written lines, is Fred Willard's TV reporter character. Those memorable one-liners take on sports play-by-play announcers in a character who got the Mayflower ship and Christopher Columbus mixed up. Who wins the dog show? It doesn't really matter. All that matters is that we see a comedy that is smart, and quiet at the same time."

Permalink",False,"`Best in Show', Christopher Guest's mockumentary about the dog show industry is, in my opinion, not quite as clever as `A Mighty Wind', but it is still hilarious nonetheless. There are so many hilarious and subtle touches and jabs, (for whatever reason, the fact that the two insane yuppie dog owners both have braces is comic gold to me) yet there is a heart to the film, and enough of a back story on each character where you actually have something invested in which dog wins, to make the film a little more than just a comic jab. I had seen `A Mighty Wind' shortly before this film, and marveled at the versatility of the actors that Guest uses in all of his films  generally, the characters they play in each of the films are quite different although the quiet, nervous characters Bob Balaban portrays are usually similar and brilliantly executed. Fred Willard also plays another blowhard in `Best in Show', this time as the show announcer and host who is inappropriate and ridiculous enough to make his co-host insane. None of Guest's regular troupe of actors ever really made it in my radar before watching his films; I knew who they were but they were never really in anything I care to see. I now see that they are immensely talented, and Guest is probably one of the most underrated comedic writers/directors in the business.

A mock-documentary look at the world of dog shows, there's no plot and it hits at easy targets, but it's full of essentially daft gags delivered absolutely deadpan. The ghastly self-absorbed characters can't really command your sympathy, but their petty awfulness rings horribly true. 'Best in Show' is not as outrageous as Guest's earlier film, the classic 'This is Spinal Tap', but the conjunction of solemnity and silliness works very well, and like that film, it actually convinces as a picture of its world.

The jokes are not subtle--they're not meant to be. The humor lies in how clueless each of the characters is, and their general lack of self-awareness. And while Guest (and his wonderful actors) certainly has fun at the characters' expense, there is also real affection for these people. It's funny but not mean-spirited.

Permalink",False,"As a dog exhibitor I REALLY wanted to like this movie, since it's the only movie I know of that is about dog shows. But it wasn't as funny as I had hoped, for two reasons... one, the people were a little *too* stereotyped (I realize this was the big joke, but it rubbed me the wrong way after awhile, that they were ALL screwy) and two, they make a few too many factual errors about the ways in which dog shows work. But I can overlook that, and laugh--at times, anyway. On the bright side, I can show this movie to my friends to prove just how NORMAL I am... despite my hobby LOL

As far as the acting, I have to say a wonderful performance was turned in by Am/Can Ch. Sunterra Stylish Affair ""Ashley"" the pomeranian in the toy group and her handler Douglas Stratton.

Seriously, tho, it wasn't too bad. My dog friends either liked it or hated it. For me it was less funny than I'd hoped since I had an ""inside"" look to the group being mocked, and personally I think there are much funnier people in REAL life ... ;)

Permalink",False,"To keep it brief, this movie was very funny, but like ""Waiting for Guffman"" (sp?), it tended to drag in parts. Perhaps my bias is fuelled by the fact that I was forced to watch every single feature put on the DVD at my friend's place, which was a little much.

Catherine O'Hara did an excellent job as the wicked wife of Eugene Levy, who himself was priceless. The scene of him walking uncomfortably with his dog, trying to stay balanced on his two left feet is not to be missed. This film, while funny, is best suited for a Canadian sense of humour, which is far more wry than that of Americans. However, it can be appreciated by the occasional American as well.

Overall, see it, but don't watch the DVD features before. Save those for like, 2 weeks later.

Permalink",False,"Christopher Guest again uses a mock-documentary style to skewer another of America's sub-cultures. This time around, it's the world of professional dog competitions. Guest focuses on about a half-dozen odd characters as they prepare their pampered pets for the big, national dog show. Sometimes Guest employs faux interviews, sprinkled throughout the movie, but mostly we eavesdrop on the owners as they wind their respective ways to Philadelphia and set up for the show. The judging itself is the climax of the movie.

Many of the actors are Second City veterans, and the movie has the feel of a manic, elongated and integrated Second City show. It's hysterical and enjoyable with Parker Posey, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and Fred Willard providing excellent comedic performances. Only one factor drags on the movie a little; the subject matter. ""Spinal Tap"", Guest's earlier 'mockumentary', focused on rock and roll, a subject matter with near universal appeal. But not many people are into dog shows, it's a real small sub-culture, and as such may not connect with the public at large. And that's too bad, because ""Best in Show"" is a real hoot."

Permalink",False,"This comic concoction from Guest (and many of the folks who brought ""Waiting for Guffman"" to life) is a mock-umentary on the sometimes surreal world of competitive dog shows. Here we have an array of participants, each matched with a dog who has a shot in the final round of competition--Best in Show. Guest does a dead-on backwoods impersonation as he drags his bloodhound to the competition. His usual flair for accents and unique characterizations is on full display. Levy and O'Hara are a mismatched, hilarious pair who hope their Norwich Terrier will take top honors. He is a nerd with two left feet (literally!) who gazes in amazement as total strangers seem to come out of the woodwork to reminisce with O'Hara about previous sexual encounters. O'Hara is so game with this and looks so right with her glossy make-up and trashy hair that it continues to be funny right up until the end of the film. Another couple (Posey and Hitchcock), a set of catalog-obsessed urban professionals, caters to their dog's every psychological whim, real or imagined. The favorite of the competition is a standard poodle, owned by buxom married-for-money Coolidge and trained by militant Lynch. Coolidge is mesmerizingly tacky with her lips out to there and nails constantly digging into some type of food. She is intriguingly offset by the plain, driven Lynch. The final contenders in the film are an outre and hysterical gay couple (McKean and Higgins.) Higgins portrayal is so right, so committed and so authentic despite the outrageousness, that he threatens to walk off with the picture. The film is virtually all ad-libbed and his are among the very best...including some that were sadly left out of the final cut, but which are gratefully found on the DVD. The melange of characters is just odd enough and varied enough to hold interest, yet real enough that they can create concern about the outcome. The whole shebang is given a ludicrously funny play-by-play from Willard as an unctuous commentator. His goal seems to be to crack up his painfully straightfaced cohort (Beckwith), who admirably holds it together. There are moments of extreme oddity along the way, but for a good-natured, amusing time with lots of adorable dogs, this movie is a great choice."

Permalink",False,"Give this film the blue ribbon. Best In Show was witty and entertaining from beginning to end. Although the mockumentary setup may seem recycled from Waiting For Guffman and This Is Spinal Tap, it actually lends itself better to this movie than the previous two. Christopher Guest does a remarkable job directing this cast of misfit characters. The plot seems rather simple and even childish, but the cream of this film lies in the characters, not the plot. Each one perfectly contrasts the others and provides his or her own moments of hilarity, which come from clever humor rather than the expected slapstick comedy. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara play priceless roles, and Fred Willard leaves the audience in stitches. Best In Show deserves a spot in the winners' circle of comedy.

I laughed for a solid 50 minutes, and just when the ""talking heads"" portion of the movie had about maxed out (and it was very funny stuff), here came the actual show portion with Fred Willard firing from every angle. I must admit that I get a goofy grin every time I see Fred Willard (who has been spectacularly underrated for almost 25 years), but nothing can prepare you for his ""color commentary"" of the show. Kudos as well to his British sidekick who straight-faced it all the way to the end. This movie played for over 30 weeks in a local theater in Ft.

Permalink",False,"Comedies come in many different shapes and forms. Some, like Eddie Murphy vehicles, feature a main character who is demonstrably more intelligent than any once else around him, so we, in the audience, get to feel superior right along with him. We actually derive comic pleasure out of flaunting that superiority. Another type of comedy is one in which the audience is made to feel superior to EVERYONE on screen. This is the category into which Christopher Guest's clever and zany mockumentaries, `Waiting for Guffman' and now `Best of Show,' belong.

So how does Guest manage to pull off this delicate high wire act of making us feel better than the characters on screen yet not having the movie slide over into cruelty and sadism? Quite simply, he makes us see ourselves in the characters at the very same time we are laughing at them. As a shrewd observer of human nature, Guest casts a scathing, yet at the same time utterly affectionate, eye on the bizarre rituals of small town Middle America. In the case of `Best in Show,' Guest opens up to us the strange milieu of dog show competitions and the people involved in them. As in `Waiting For Guffman,' he has assembled a cast of lovably eccentric characters to both act out the little dramas of their lives and address the audience directly in the form of mock interviews. There is no point in reiterating the specifics of the many colorful characters whose lives we follow in the course of the film. Those you can check out for yourself. Suffice it to say that Guest makes us see many of our own obsessions, peculiarities and insecurities reflected in these people. True, competitive dog shows may not be our own particular cup of tea, but we all fixate on SOMETHING that the rest of the world seems ignorantly unwilling to understand, something we may hide from our fellow men simply because they will not `get it.' `Best in Show' lets us laugh at ourselves without our having to reveal our own personal sore spot.

The large and superb cast is called upon to hit just the right comic note, ranging from subtle pathos to over-the-top absurdity  and it is a challenge the actors meet with flying colors. Perhaps to demonstrate his egalitarian spirit, Guest gives some of his funniest bits to Fred Willard as a show announcer who has not a clue as to the finer points of the competition. As the one person not initiated into the mysteries of the proceedings, Willard's character seems more out of touch than the eccentrics who get it all.

On the laugh meter, `Best of Show' doesn't rate quite as high as `Waiting For Guffman.' But for its moments of homespun cleverness and charm, it is definitely a comedy well worth checking out for yourself. `Best in Show' indeed!"

The beauty of this film is it's a tribute to the many parts that make up the human spirit. The heroic, passionate, and romantic sides of humanity are represented well in film. Guest has revealed the more awkward, vulnerable and sometimes pathetic side of humanity, and does it with great affection. I think maybe the people who hate this film are people who are afraid they are watching part of themselves up on the screen. I recognized many facets of my own personality in this film and delighted in the recognition. What he has done is simply magnify them. Seinfeld did the same thing with George Constanza.

Even days afterwards I find myself laughing at some of the lines. I reccommend seeing it twice. There's too much good stuff to take in in one viewing. Even the dogs seem to be given a deadpan almost Buster Keaton like performance.

Permalink",False,"Best in Show follows a group of people whose dogs are competing in a championship dog show. The movie is a ""mock-umentary""; that is, it's staged as if it is a documentary complete with interviews with people living their real lives. In writing this review, I found myself grappling with the task of defining a mockumentary. This is my best effort: In standard movies, we know that the people on the screen are actors playing characters. In a documentary, we know that the people are real people, not actors or characters. A mockumentary combines the two: the people on the screen are actually actors, but the characters they play are people living real lives. So the difference is that in real movies, we know that the characters are not real people. In mockumentaries, we are led to believe that the characters are real people, but we know that they're not. Perfectly clear, right?

So why is a mockumentary funny? Surely we can laugh at the real people around us, but we may do so cautiously for fear of hurting their feelings. A mockumentary is enjoyable because it lets us off the hook; we can freely laugh at these real people, because we know they're actually not real people, but merely portraying real people with all of their shortcomings.

Although the premise may be complicated, the joke isn't. Best in Show simply displays the foibles of several types of people when they are placed into an artificial situation. Literally every scene delivers a healthy giggle at the least, all the way up to true belly laughs. The show is in reality a McGuffin that lets us observe human silliness. There is the striving, hard-nosed young woman who has chosen winning dog shows as her life's work. There is the decent, sweet-hearted country boy who thinks he may be smarter than he really is, but if he isn't, that'll be okay with him. There is the thirty-something couple who place great and equal value on designer catalogues and dog toys. There is the middle-aged couple who are at once dim bulbs but who also have a lot of love for each other, awkward though it may seem. And there are the two outwardly gay men who know how to work together as a caring couple, and who aren't afraid to be their own goofy selves in public simply to enjoy their lives.

We also meet the show's broadcast host, who is a perfect portrayal of every media type who exudes enthusiasm but does so only because it's his job; he actually has no clue as to what is going on, nor does he care. And he has a trusty color commentator who is a dog show expert; we know he's an expert because he has a British accent.

Much of the comedy has nothing to do with the show. Catherine O'Hara's past love life surfaces consistently, much to her loving but perplexed husband's dismay. Ed Begley, Jr., as the manager of the hotel where the contestants are staying, cares so much about his clients that he will do anything to keep them from not having a room. Larry Davis has a small role as a man whose job it is to talk down people who have climbed tall buildings; we get to see him in action and understand why his success rate is on the smallish side.

The heart of this comedy is the fact that while all of these folks may fail to measure up in one way or another, we know that they're not bad people; they just act the way we all do. Sometimes our hearts and emotions get in the way of actually doing something important. Best in Show warms because that while we may fear looking silly, we innately know it's not a bad thing. While we fail most of the time and can look foolish while we're at it, at least we tried and did so with good intentions. Have you ever been at a party or convention and attempted making small talk with a group of people you didn't know and didn't care about, and make it sound meaningful? You'll have plenty of opportunities to laugh at yourself in this movie.

A final note: the winner of the show was the only person who really looked like they were walking their dog."

Permalink",False,"The dog world will never be the same again after the success of Best In Show. Nothing has captured the spirit and fun of the world of the dog fanciers like this film. As a Former breeder and owner/handler, (those people dumb enough to show their own dogs in a violently, political dog-eat-dog world) I could not stop laughing throughout the film. As if the characters' lines were not hysterical enough - the facial expressions of the actors said it all. The only stereotypes that were missing were the slightly loaded judge and the obvious, obnoxious power plays that take place in the ring. They should definitely be included in Best Of Show Part II. If you loved this film you will also love a new book that is out entitled: ""When Pets Come Between Partners"" by Joel Gavriele-Gold. A shrink takes a look at all the ways we ""use"" our pets to avoid dealing with our own psychological issues. I'm sure Gavriele-Gold would have given anything to have Gerry and Cookie Fleck in his office. A great film and a great read.

Permalink",False,"Best In Show is original to be sure. I had several good belly laughs which prompts me to recommend it. The characters in this film are memorable and I found myself laughing at different scenes after I left the theatre. It is a spoof on dog shows in general , especially the dog owners. The characters range from a Gay couple to a Lesbian couple to a hound dog lover and so on. The last 30 minutes you will enjoy the final awards given to the best dogs narrated by, a funnier than usual, Willard Scott. An hour and a half is perfect for this movie. You should know that there are many scenes that are simply not funny. If you can wade through those, you will be rewarded many times throughout the film. If you love dogs, you will probably like the movie even more. I gave it a 7 out of 10.

The actors were all hilarious portraying various dog owners bringing their prized pets to the fictitious Mayflower Dog Show. But more than anything, Fred Ward made this movie. His role as the show's commentator was one of the funniest performance of 2000(albeit, a lean year for comedies and movies as a whole). This is not to take away from the rest of the cast, who all were phenomenal. Definitely worth you're film dollar.

Permalink",False,"Filmed in the mockumentary style of Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show is a very good film. Its stylistic acting (like Guffman) and a cast including many of the same actors are a tribute to Christopher Guest and his direction.

Guest himself provides the greatest acting contribution to the film in his portrayal of Harlan Pepper, a very human yet highly comedic character. Eugene Levy and Fred Willard deserve mention; the rest of the acting was on par, but not much more. Eugene Levy, the perennial character actor, plays a role that we've seen a variation of on other occasions, but plays it well with quirks that I've not seen him play.

Joseph T. Garrity and Monique Prudhomme (the production designer and costume designer respectively) were integral in the mood of the film as it looked like a documentary (thank you Garrity) and the costumes were comic, but realistic (thank you Prudhomme).

One thing that has always bothered me about film was the notion of a continuity error and there is one that I could not overlook in this film. Aside from one major continuity error, the editing was good overall.

Now I come to the thing that bothered me most about this film; admittedly, it is something that should not have bothered me: my expectations. I expected to walk into the movie house and not stop laughing until I came out much like I did when I saw Waiting for Guffman; however, I didn't find it nearly as funny. Perhaps that is because I work in the theatre, perhaps because I've never owned a dog. Consider this a warning, though. Don't go into the theatre expecting to see a ""sequel of Waiting for Guffman,"" as I've read many times, expect to see a movie in a similar style on completely different subject matter with completely different characters.

Also bothersome, was the depth (or lack thereof) of most of the characters. I found most of them to be caricatures rather than human beings. However, I heard the woman behind me say that she liked all of the characters as people, so perhaps it's only because I haven't ever known anyone who has participated in a dog show.

In order to not end this review on a down note, I'd like to point out that I do recommend this film to anyone. Perhaps dog owners will appreciate it more, but it is a film that you should see."

I literally laughed until I cried. If you want a fun movie night out, this movie should be at the top of your list. You'll be surprised how many people are in it whose names you don't know but whose faces are very familiar. There are no prima-donnas in this film, it's not big budget, and there isn't much sex or violence. If that's what you crave, skip this movie. It's simply a cute story told in a highly professional manner by very good actors and actresses. The top notch writing and acting made this movie really deliver for me.

Permalink",False,"This is a very funny and yet warm movie.

It is nothing serious, and it is one of those simple films that leave you feeling all warm inside and a big grin on your face. The characters are done so well, especially the neurotic repressed Wamierauner(sp?) owners.

The dialogue in this film is so superb and it seems like it was all adlibbed. That is what makes it so amazing, here is a sample (somewhat accurate but conveys the mood and brilliance of the writing).

""We met at Starbucks"" ""No not AT Starbucks exactly you see"" ""Oh yes that's right.."" ""See he was sitting AT a Starbucks across the street drinking Late"" ""Yeah and she was sitting at the OTHER Starbucks across the street, not the one I was in bUT THE other one over there drink umm, Capuccino.. ""No Mochachino,.. ""Oh yeah right...""

Classic. Or even better:

""We have many things in common. We both like soup.""

Great characters, funny, just pure enjoyable. The movie does kind of make fun of the whole 'business of dogs and their owners', but it is harmless. I think it is even harder for actors to pull something off like this in a mocumentary as opposed to a standard film cause the characters have to come across as REAL people not actors. What a great job they did.

Rating 7.5 out of 10."

Permalink",False,"While I found the movie about dogs very funny on a superficial level, it was really quite a commentary on relationships! From the interaction between the Flecks to the interplay of the two commentators at the Mayflower, it was obvious that source of the humor was really the interplay between people, not the quirkiness of dog owners. It was only more obvious because the humans tried to use the dogs as surrogate partners if they didn't get the response that they were looking to get!

I believe the movie was at least as funny as Spinal Tap, but more meaningful. Partly because I could more easily relate to the characters, but also because we all have an interest or two, that when viewed by others, is quirky and odd.

While I found the acting and writing to be quite fresh (how much can YOU bench press?), it did on a couple of occasions revert too easily to comedic stereotypes.

Permalink",False,"If you plan on going to see this movie, I recommend going to a matinee. It will be cheaper and you will be less disappointed if you're as ambivalent about this film as I am. Positives about this movie include spectacular casting and a heavy dose of humor. Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey are the most believable couple in the entire film, and the joke they make about how they met was hilarious to me (but likely only because I used to work at a Starbucks that _was_ directly across the street from another). However, the believability of this movie as a whole was lacking. ""Dancer in the Dark,"" with all its moments that required you to suspend your disbelief, was more believable than ""Best in Show."" Also, while I understand that this is a mockumentary, I feel that like a real documentary, films in this genre should make you care about the people in it. This one didn't. This was a funny movie, but the bottom line for me is this: It's more intelligent than an Adam Sandler movie, but just as pointless.

Big Studios usually pour money into Action films with Star names and straight comedies with Star names. That's too bad, because I think that movies like these would do consistently well, if they were given more of a chance. I wonder how many great scripts are out there that aren't being filmed because they don't fit Tom Cruise's profile and there are no stunts or buildings being blown up?

This script actually required talent and well thought out characters. I miss that. I think our standards for movies today have gotten extremely low. This movie, with it's straight forward wit, raises the comedy bar a bit.

If ""Guffman"" did one thing exceptionally well it was it's use of subtlety. There were so few straight up jokes, and almost none of your typical sight gags or physical comedy. The story of these pathetic lives ran deep and by diggin into them you realized how much funnier and truer they were. The best example of this, and where Best at Show departs, is the tense hidden love of Steve, the Pharmacist, for Corky. Eluded to only in passing comments, some exceptional cheering and a quick glance of the eyes, it never really comes out and nails it on the head with a big ""HELLO AUDIENCE - STEVE IS GAY"". But then there is ""Best at Show"" which sets it up with road signs that the rich lady and her trainer (their names escape me) are hiding a little something, and then lets it rip on national television. Sure I laughed, but still wanted something a little more.

Permalink",False,"Christopher Guest proves himself again in this very funny movie about the premier dog show in the U.S. and the people who are excited by it. The ensemble of comedians, many of whom Guest worked with before in ""Spinal Tap"" and ""Waiting for Guffman"" play off each other brilliantly and keep the laughs coming. This is satire of our times at its finest. Besides the serious belly laughs provided by Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and Eugene Levy, there are the more subtle characters like Ed Begley, as the tolerant hotel manager and Bob Balaban and Don Lake as the self-serious heads of the dogshow, who provide surrealistic views of the actual people who make an event like this happen.

And then there are the dogs, each one a real champion in his own way. It truly is hard to pick just one to route for. I especially liked Hubert, the bloodhound, the shitzu and, of course, little Winky, the terrier. One charming part of this film is that the love of the owners for their dogs really came through. Especially poignant was Guest's character, coming from a rural Southern area to the show in Philadelphia, because of pride and belief in his Hubert. AND, who knew that Guest could do such a brilliant backwoods accent?!"

Permalink",False,"This is the funniest movie of the year. The last time I laughed so much, it had to be Galaxy Quest, but the jokes then were often about Star Trek and other space shows, not just the situation itself. The laughter in the audience was so different, here, though. Much stronger, probably the way Airplane was in the theaters. Made it hard to follow the movie, so many people kept laughing, you missed the next lines. A good reason to see it again.

I was a fan of SCTV about 20 years ago, even though the show was uneven, but I loved the way Catherine O'Hara acted, and she's quite good here. So is Eugene Levy.

If you don't know the plot, it's about dog show contestants. We follow six couples as they prepare to leave home for the Mayflower dog show in Philadelphia, and then we watch them in the competition. We finally see the winner after the show has long gone, about a year later. The style is mock documentary, even though we never see who's doing the ""documentary"". It's just the style.

Wish it had been longer, guess it was about 90 minutes. It never slowed down, even though there are clearly sections where they don't go for sustained laughs, especially for the guy who lives in a town called Pinenut.

The film is remarkably kind to strange people, though it uses them for laughs. It nevers flips over the edge into cruelty. For instance, there's a chesty woman who has a lot to do with Anna Nicole Smith, who has married a real, real old geezer for the money. The geezer is hilarious, even though he never says a word. If he'd said any lines, it would have been at the expense of good taste, I expect. Instead, we simply are invited to imagine what he is like.

This is the best movie of its kind. Of course, I've never seen a movie about dog shows. I'll go see it again very soon, at least to start finding all the other stuff I didn't hear over the laughter. I don't recall anything anybody in the movie said, though, which means I doubt it will have the influence of Caddyshack or Airplane. Still, the flick is funny on its own terms.

By the way, it gets the laughs without making fun of the idea of dog shows. People in the audience loved the dogs, so the jokes didn't alienate them by questioning the validity of the dog show itself.

I saw this in a small Berkeley theater. Hope it gets picked up by the large megaplexes.

Woof! Woof! Woof! (3 out of 4 woofs)"

Permalink",False,"Like author/actor Christopher Guests' other mocumentary' `This Is Spinal Tap' much of `Best in Show' is unscripted -- and it shows. While most of it works well, some of the rambling dialogue goes nowhere and a more lethal editor could have done much to move this movie along.

The beginning sequences that introduce the characters to you seem to go on forever; but it does get better.

There are some wickedly funny lines and situations: every male that comes into contact with Cookie Fleck (the incomparable Catherine O'Hara) and the resulting discomfort by her old Second City TV' pal (and co-author of this movie) Eugene Levy (Gerry Fleck) is a running joke carried out all the way to the final scenes.

There are lots of great cameos and you will spend a certain amount of time wondering ""who IS that?""

Real champion dogs were used in this film to great effect. The dogs are as beautiful as the people are strange.

It did leave me wondering just how much of this very quirky movie was based on real-life experience in the world of professional dog shows.

This is definitely a movie for dog lovers of all breeds -- but professionals in that field may be offended by its potential slice of life reality."

Permalink",False,"Writer/director Christopher Guest takes a look at the relationship between Man and that most loyal of beasts, the dog, in `Best In Show,' a humorous satire presented in the same `mock documentary' style as Rob Reiner's `This Is Spinal Tap.' It's a keen observation of human nature, as it is much more about the owners and handlers than about the dogs themselves, and much as David Byrne did with `True Stories,' Guest presents a diverse community united by a single, common thread, that being their love for their dogs, and aspirations of winning the blue ribbon in the upcoming competition that will go to the top dog overall, the Best In Show. Through a series of interviews and memorable scenes, we are introduced to the owners and their beloved canines who will soon square off in the arena at the world class Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. We get to know a bit about each of the participants, so we know just who they are and where they come from. Guest has assembled a terrific ensemble cast, who bring it all to life by creating a rich tapestry of characters culled from a true cross section of Americana: Good ol' boy Harlan Pepper (Guest), with his Bloodhound, `Hubert', from Pine Nut, North Carolina; a somewhat neurotic young couple from Illinois, Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock), members of the `Starbucks' set with their Weimaraner, `Beatrice;' Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara), a couple who could be anybody's next door neighbors, with their Norwich Terrier, `Winky', from Fern City, Florida; Leslie and Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw and Jennifer Coolidge) a wealthy couple who have a Standard Poodle, `Rhapsody In White', entrusted to the care of professional handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch); and finally, another couple, Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean), with their precious Shih Tzus, `Miss Agnes.' This is a highly entertaining, funny movie, filled with wry, subtle humor that is delivered straight and never played for laughs, which makes it believable and real, and all the more hilarious. This is quite a group of characters, eclectic to say the least, and they're all real people. You're bound to run into someone you know among them. The dialogue is sharp, and rife with dry wit. And for anyone who's ever watched any kind of sporting event on television, you'll appreciate the parody of the so-called `color commentator,' in this case a guy named Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), that is dead on the money. His comments during an interview to a nonplused Dr. Millbank (Bob Balaban) about Columbus landing at Plymouth Rock will have you on the floor. There is so much here you can relate to, and it's all done in such good fun. Rounding out the outstanding supporting cast are Don Lake (Graham Chissolm), Jim Piddock (Trevor Beckwith), Ed Begley, Jr. (Hotel manager), Linda Kash (Fay Berman), Larry Miller (Max Berman) and Don S. Davis (Best In Show Judge). The performances here are good all around, with especially notable turns by O'Hara, Levy, Guest, Lynch and Willard. Written by Guest and Levy, `Best In Show' works so well because it holds up a mirror and reflects the lives we all lead in one way or another. As we watch, we realize that even as we are laughing at all of these characters and situations, at the same time we're laughing at ourselves as well; because there's more than a little bit of each one of us in there somewhere. And it reminds us that when things seem to be getting too serious, it's time to pick up that mirror and take a good look; and thanks to the frame of reference that a movie like this provides, you just may find something to laugh about, and be able to discover the `Best In Show' in your own life. I rate this one 9/10."

Permalink",False,"As a friend of a big dog breeder and shower, ""Best In Show"" was automatically on our must see list. I assumed, having been to LOTS of dog shows, that I'd be in a good position to get all the ""in jokes"".

What Best In Show was, was a brilliantly acted, brilliantly written and subtle series of character studies. The fact that the characters were participating in a dog show was almost insignificant.

Christopher Plummer absolutely enters his character and stays there. In fact, there isn't a weak performance ANYWHERE! And the chemistry betweween the cast membbers is magic.

This is a MUST SEE MOVIE if you appreciate great acting, and truth in writing.

Don't expect it to be a story - it's done in documentary style with dog owners talking about getting ready for dog shows. The characterizations are hilarious. The glamour girl and the old man - like Anna Nicole Smith and her old guy - that was so funny. And the husband/wife team - they kept running into her old lovers who all had to remark on her love-making skills right in front of her daffy husband! This movie won't appeal to everyone. When it ended, an elderly couple in front of us stood up, and the lady turned to the man and said, ""That's the last time I'm letting you pick the show."" She looked like she wanted to slug him. We thought it was very funny - or more amusing than ""ha ha"" funny. But you do have to like quirky humor. Really - it's a hoot!!

Essentially everyone will see something of themselves in one or more of these characters. With the exception of the male gay couple, all are EXTREMELY disfunctional (to use current psychobabble) as seen from the outside but somehow work perfectly for each other within the confines of the relationship.

Like any hobby, purebred dog ownership develops a fanaticism and a subculture that is difficult to comprehend for the casual observer. That's where Best in Show starts. It is a hilarious look at what goes on behind the scenes and in preparation for a national dog show and contest. Yes, it is billed as a mockumentary, but I have to wonder how much of this tale is truly spun from the thread of exaggeration. Christopher Guest is brilliant, both as a writer and a performer in this film.

Permalink",False,"I am a dog-lover and always look forward every year to the two days in February when the Westminster Kennel Club dog show is broadcast on TV. It was with that anticipation that I went to see Best in Show, which is set around the fictional Mayflower Kennel Club dog show in Philadelphia.

I thought that the first half of the movie, where the characters and the dogs are introduced was just downright boring. I think that the storyline with Christopher Guest (as Harlan Pepper) and his bloodhound was particularly uninteresting. I think that there were probably too many characters to really develop a story for each and you don't get too involved with them. I think the story should have been about two of the dogs and their owners (I probably would have chosen the gay Shih-Tzu owners and the ultra-yuppie Weimaraner owners to focus on, they had the most potential).

Fred Willard as Buck Laughlin steals the movie as the TV announcer who obviously gets assigned the dog show because he's annoyed somebody at the network. He knows nothing about dogs and dog shows and doesn't hesitate to ask his sophisticated and knowledgeable British co-host the most stupid and embarrassing of questions. Buck just roles off one hilarious one-liner after another. It finally got to the point where the audience I watched the movie with laughed before he opened his mouth because they knew he was going to say something very funny. This is Fred Willard's finest moment in a long career.

Overall, Best in Show is OK, but not that great. It isn't in the class of This is Spinal Tap, Guest's masterpiece about an aging heavy metal band. Probably worth waiting for the video to come on this one."

Christopher Guest has done it again. He has reassembled the entire ""Guffman"" cast and added a couple of new faces to his troupe and they all have turned out another hilarious mockumentary. The plot points are somewhat predictable, but the film is enjoyable nonetheless. My only slight criticism is that after Guest has handled such subjects as rock music, theatre and the film industry, a dog show film may be slightly obscure for some people. There are some great doggies in the movie, though.

Permalink",False,"Funny THIS IS SPINAL TAP like look at dog shows and the owners who get involved in them.

In the age of broad in your face comedy that literally forces you to laugh by beating you over the head, this low key approach is like a breath of fresh air. It's not a laugh out loud comedy, but it will get you to consistently chuckle as all the quirks and flaws of these 'normal' people are slowly exposed like acne on a teenager.

Modeled after an old SCTV comedy with a 'serious' facade giving away to complete absurdity. Among the highlights are a couple who treat their dog like a spoiled child and project all their insecurity onto the pet. Also has a Florida couple who max out their credit cards and are forced to stay in a hotel utility room. Fred Willard as a off the wall dog show announcer and a six months later wrap up are also a standout.

The only real quibble is that it becomes a true comedy movie and not the mock documentary it was intended to be. The filmmakers should have tried harder to keep it more 'real'. Like showing a actual documentary crew or having a actual interviewer following these people around.

Overall a refreshing comedy for those who can appreciate the subtle, low key qualities."

Permalink",False,"I'm a cat person. My Dad always had dogs, but he never took care of them. And while I like all animals, when my Mom and I lived together after the divorce, I talked her into getting a cat. That led to more cats, and this is probably way more than you need to know about my history with pets. Oh, there's one more thing, I got a full bred Keeshond for my son last year, and the dog is a major irritant in my life right now.

I went to Best In Show to laugh at dog people, and all I can say is MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. I happen to think Christopher Guest is a brilliant filmmaker. In Best In Show, he has captured the absurd and oddly compelling pageantry of dog shows. And this is more than just a `dog owners tend to look like their dog breed' chuckle, this is an outrageous lampoon of the people who treat their pets better than people.

Best In Show is a mockumentary of a dog show, similar to the Westminster Kennel Club competition that's become must-see-TV in our house every February. In the grandly funny style of This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman, we watch interviews with different dog owners and trainers and see glimpses into their odd little lives. Of course, it all leads up to the dog show, with the requisite gamesmanship, tension and hilarity, as we follow what goes on behind the scenes and also hear the broadcast commentary. My favorite character is Fred Willard's Buck Laughlin, a former pro-athlete (think Joe Garagiola) who provides clueless and irreverent commentary during the ""broadcast."" He goes so far as to suggest the bloodhound should wear as Sherlock Holmes type hat and pipe!

Christopher Guest writes, directs and stars (Harlan Pepper, bloodhound owner) in this masterful comedy. His Spinal Tap buddy, Michael McKean (Stefan Vanderhoof), teams up with John Michael Higgins (Scott Donlan) to provide a lot of laughs as a single sex couple in love with their Shih Tzu. They even have a disparaging remark about keeshonds. I was the only one in the theater laughing really hard about that one, but for the most part, a large and widely diverse audience at the cinema on a Sunday night laughed throughout the film.

Best in Show is rated PG-13 for language and sex-related material. And, there's a bit more involved with that than a pug humping away on a man's leg, though there's just something funny about that.

And, there's a lot that's funny about Best In Show. The laughs come from material that's sophomoric and from material that's sophisticated. The important part is, the laughs keep on coming! Best In Show earns five stars, on my scale 0-5. Tail wagging good fun!"
