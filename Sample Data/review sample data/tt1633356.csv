Permalink",False,"My god this movie is horrible, I am quite a fan of shark movies and all that jazz do I looked forward to this new installment in the genre, however I must say that this movie is just ridiculous. For these movies to work I think they need to have some humor thrown in to the mix, films such as Piranha 3d know what they are and play with it but Shark Night just takes itself far too seriously and in the end it's just bad bad bad.

Even Sara Paxton and Chris Zylka, two young actors who I quite enjoy couldn't save this film. The fact that you barely even see any sharks is dumb too, basically all you see us fin and that's it, and the scenes when you do see a shark the special effects are so cheaply done that I felt like I was having a joke played on me, the special effects are not much better than the ones that you see in the SyFy TV movies like Sharktopus, but even those films are better than this garbage.

One scene when a shark literally flies out of the water and attacks a man who is hanging on to a tree is just ridiculous, these people can't be really taking it serious I hope. I strongly urge everyone to save their money and go and rent either The Reef or a SyFy film, anything is better than this. I hope Sara Paxton is able to recover."

Permalink",False,"I was not expecting something as enjoyable or over the top as last year's Piranha 3D but I was at least expecting some time killing shark attack fun. It seems however that they couldn't even pull that off.

The script is horrific and the plot is ho-hum but more importantly, takes way too long to get going. Every character is dull and hollow and the stale acting doesn't help. But in all honesty this could be forgiven had the film actually delivered on what was expected. There's surprisingly very little in the way of shark carnage. The PG13 rating means death scenes mostly consist of some flailing in red water. Other death scenes are almost completely off-screen. I'm not a gore fanatic but when the film has nothing else going for it, this could have easily saved it to a degree. They don't even capitalize on the 3D. There were a few genuinely creepy moments in the film that actually made me want to cover my eyes (something I haven't wanted to do in over 15 years)but these are so few and far between. I longed for more of these but the film seems to be too interested in silly melodramatic plot. The film also just takes itself way too seriously to the point where it just isn't fun to watch... which is all you'd be wanting going into a 3D horror movie about sharks.

It's a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of 'Piranha 3D' but without the tongue-in-cheek self-awareness or over the top gory thrills, there's very little to recommend in 'Shark Night 3D'. It could have worked as a campy throwback or It could have even worked as a more serious horror movie because I did feel uneasy at times but it really doesn't do either any justice."

Permalink",False,"This movie started out so great, it had that whole ""Jaws""-theme going on, and it really looked like it was going to be a movie that would pay homage to the classic ""Jaws"" movies, then it all came crashing down hard and went downhill.

""Shark Night"" is without a doubt one of the stupidest story lines I have ever seen in a shark movie. The whole plot was just so far-fetched that it didn't even come off remotely plausible. That whole ""oh-you-hurt-me-years-ago-and-now-it-is-payback-time"" plot didn't work at all! It was ludicrous and it really made the movie bad.

Another thing that the movie had working against it was the darkness. Most of the movie was shot at night with little or no lighting at all, and you couldn't really see what was going on at times. That was so lame. When you sit down to watch movies you don't want to be kept in the dark and have little chance to see what's going on. Had they kept the movie in daylight it would have worked so much better.

As for the characters in the movie, well you hardly got to immerse yourself in any of the characters, aside from Sara (played by Sara Paxton) and to some extend Dennis (played by Chris Carmack). The rest of the characters were nothing more than bystanders with shallow stories to contribute to the plot.

The cast themselves were good, though. The people they had cast for the various roles actually did good jobs, and that was the main thing that ""Shark Night"" had working for it.

Having seen ""Shark Night"" now I feel very disappointed and cheated out of my time, because this movie was disappointing on so many levels. It is only once in awhile that there is a really nice shark movie to hit the market, ""Shark Night"" however, wasn't one of them.

And the ending of the movie, are you kidding me? Come on! I am not going to spoil it here by revealing it, but wow, that was an ending you saw coming a mile away, and it was just so anti-climatic."

Permalink",False,"Seven young and pretty undergraduates head to a secluded lakeside cottage in Louisiana to take a load off and enjoy a wild and crazy weekend away. But things take a turn for the worst when a member of the group is attacked by a shark. Isolated with no cell service and no help in sight, the group quickly realizes they are on their own, but the water around them is not safe.

I wanted Shark Night 3D to be as fun as Piranha 3D was last year. Despite the PG-13 rating, I held onto a desperate hope that it would somehow manage to live up to that level of gleeful insanity and absolutely ridiculous trashiness. I knew deep down it would never be anywhere near comparable, but everything about the film suggested it would be an enjoyable ride.

Sadly, this is not the case.

Instead of getting a ridiculous movie about sharks mauling pretty 20- somethings that embraces the sheer silliness of the very idea, we get a deadly serious, high-concept slasher film that seems to have no concept of what fun is. Sure we get the typical horror movie wise ass quips sprinkled here and there, and some rather intriguing reasoning as to why the attacks are occurring. But in-between these moments, we get stilted dialogue, wooden performances, characters with next to no dimensionality whatsoever, and just about nothing else. Despite it being 2011, the film feels like it belongs to a different era – one where it has not realized how outrageous and frivolous the genre has become. It offers nothing new by way of ideas or story, and somehow thinks an ode to Jaws at the beginning of the film is appropriate. I initially wanted to criticize Shark Night for cribbing from Piranha. But in watching the film, it is obvious they learned absolutely nothing from Alexandre Aja and his crew.

But while the bad story and worse acting are to be expected, what is really disappointing is just how much of a grand tease the whole movie is. The rating may be a contributing factor, but the only thing it seems to cut out is gratuitous nudity. The T and A is still plentiful, and the film is actually surprisingly graphic in some instances. But the majority of deaths, the best part of any slasher film, are merely hinted at. We see characters get pulled underwater, and just when you think we will see their grisly end, the film inexplicably cuts to the next scene. Hell, we do not even get the obligatory shot confirming that a character did indeed die. How do we know they did not manage to fight off the shark and survive to fight another day? And since there are about ten people in the entire cast, most of which meet an untimely end, that is a whole lot of teasing and not a lot of pay off. I can only think of one that is explicitly shown, and even that seemed like it was pushing it based on what happens during the rest of the film. It is all very arbitrary, but it seems like a rather obscene faux pas on the part of the filmmakers.

Remember how comically bad and exaggerated the piranha looked in Piranha 3D? Somehow, the sharks in Shark Night 3D look even worse. There is nothing realistic about them. They look more cartoonish than anything, standing out as not even attempting to look like they belong in any of the scenes. They make memories of the shark from Jaws appear more frighteningly authentic than I thought possible. But this is only when the sharks are swimming around underwater, looking menacing and hungry . When they actually interact with the characters, they look absolutely absurd and preposterous. A shot involving a shark leaping out of the water to attack one of the characters as he zips by on a jet-ski looks even worse than those ludicrously awful effects you may have seen from Shark Attack 3: Megalodon. They may actually qualify for some of the worst effects in the past decade. Surely the special effects team realized they were working on an actual movie with a budget, and not some straight-to-DVD Asylum knockoff. So what could possibly be there excuse for such a terrible job?

I think the only thing I remotely enjoyed was how impressive the underwater shots looked in 3D. They were clearly shot with the format in mind, and look absolutely stunning even with a fake shark in the background. They frequently took me entirely out of the film, as they look like they belong in a significantly better project. The shots are just so tranquil and so beautiful that they may make you forget what an awful movie you are sitting through. With the exception of an over-the- top explosion, this is just about the only thing that sizzles in 3D. There are no other elements that even attempt to take advantage of the format.

When I tell you that Shark Night 3D is one of the worst films of the year, with next to no redeeming qualities, you better believe I am not lying. I was hoping it would be somewhat fun, but instead it was one of the most annoying and agonizing films I have ever put myself through. The film is too serious to be enjoyable, and fails to deliver in almost every respect. The filmmakers and cast should be ashamed of themselves. When the credits rolled, I could not leave the theatre fast enough because I was ashamed to have actually watched it. Apparently there is a rap music video after the credits conclude, featuring the entire cast. Somehow, I still do not think this could make up for the travesty you have to put yourself through to get to it.

Piranha 3D was much better!! In this movie, you could always predict who the bad guy was and exactly what was going to happen next. They never really explained where the sharks came from....left some unanswered questions. Katherine McPhee from American Idol did a pretty good job, though! I didn't see it in 3D, but i honestly don't think it would be any better! I hope they don't make a sequel!! Save your money for the remake of The Thing coming out soon!

Permalink",True,"I never wrote a review until now, but ""Shark Night 3D"" inspired me to do so.

Let me tell you something, up until the third act, the film starts out pretty decent. Like ""Piranha 3D"", which it tries to be, it opens up with someone getting killed, then opens up to an upbeat tune. It starts out funny, with Sara Paxton, Dustin Milligan, Katherine McPhee (though I liked her better in ""The House Bunny""), and Chris Zylka (soon to be seen in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" as Flash Thompson) handing in charismatic performances.

The second act comes where the comedy takes a nosedive for the horror to come around. Aside from a nicely acted monologue from Paxton where her character recounts a life-affecting tragedy, director David R. Ellis (who you may remember also directed a similar tongue-in-cheek film, ""Snakes on a Plane""), fumbles the ball when trying to jerk out tears. Especially when Malik (Sinqua Walls) explodes into a crying fit about losing his girlfriend (it's not the levels of Tyler Perry's soap opera casserole, but it doesn't register) before going out to fight a shark.

*SPOILER ALERT* But what drove the film right into the ground was the fact that the titular villains - the sharks - were almost background noise to the real villains: a redneck trio (Donal Logue, Joshua Leonard, and Chris Carmack) who use the sharks for their reality show. Believe it or not, this is an original idea, and it could've worked wonders. However, Ellis envisions the bloodthirsty madmen as... well, bloodthirsty madmen. It's done in such a borderline cartoonish way, making them over-the-top, mustache-twirling villains, and Ellis seems to take delight into pushing the envelope of their insane ways, even to a point where the main characters become background noise like the sharks. And hearing why one of the characters went into this profession is another clichéd revenge ploy. This concoction takes the joy away from the film, and it becomes bad torture porn.

Permalink",True,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS (THOUGH NOTHING CAN SPOIL THIS FILM MORE THAN ITS ARTLESS EXISTENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE)

Quite possibly the worst film I have ever watched in my 35 years of life, Shark Night 3D beats such classics as Demi Moore's 'Striptease' (barring the one scene that made that bearable, of course). The word derivative does not begin to describe it. The dialogue, plot, acting, effects and general direction is some of the most abysmal I have seen to the point that it seems as if various people involved with the film are competing to do the worst job imaginable. Unlike some reviewers, I don't even think it starts well. It's preposterous from the outset, dribbles through numerous lines of drivel and ends like a wet fart.

I found myself counting how many times something completely unlikely or discontinuous happened but lost count. Some of these lowlights include such things as sharks flying out of the water, sharks swimming just as fast as jet-skis, some bizarrely contrived plot involving a scorned love affair from years ago, the idea that people would pay some hillbillies to watch sharks eat people live on camera in a lake and a truly beyond-hilarious scene in which a one-armed man (whose limb has only just been bitten off in a previous scene) wades out waist-deep into a lake to goad a shark with a cattle-prod: a scene that would have been met with derisory parody way back in the 30s/40s when Tarzan was still wrestling with rubber crocodiles.

In my own humble opinion, however, it is the dialogue-writer who wins the award as it so accurately mirrors the pattern of writing that a slightly autistic 8-year-old boy who has just seen Jaws and some other horror b-movies might adopt. Congratulations to that person!

You would think that the 3D effects might save it as one of those 'so bad it's good and at least we get some comedy deaths and a bit of eye popping horror', right? Wrong. Besides random flying sharks, we get a moment in which mini-sharks eat a woman to death and some of them come at us quickly whilst they do so. This lacks any even mild shock or surprise value nor anything convincing, realistic-looking or genuinely horrific considering how predictable every step of the film is.

Seriously, Shark Night 3D may be rated a '15' but I think the intelligence of your average 15-year-old will be very, very insulted. I only watched this because, as a fan of horror, I wanted to know how bad horror films could be in this day and age. Now I know. They used to use the term 'straight to DVD' to describe bad movies, now it's 'straight to 3D'.

If anyone rates this film highly, it would be a good idea to go check out any other good reviews of theirs as a general guideline for what- not-to-watch.

Permalink",True,"This movie stars Sara Paxton and Katherine McPhee among other unknown people. The stars are not important. What we have here is a PG-13 shark movie. Something that is so unnatural, I'm surprised that it even exists.

A group of unlikeable college kids go to a lake and get eaten by sharks released by crazy hillbillies. Everyone was unlikeable. Joel David Moore is probably the most likable. He's the most entertaining part of this movie.

Before I saw this movie I was wondering how they were going to pull off the death scenes with a PG-13 rating. As expected, there is a lot of thrashing around in the red coloured water before they are pulled down under. As long as they don't show the blood pouring it's okay. There was a scene when a guy lost his arm and except for the blood on his clothes, there was no bleeding to be seen. I wanted to see some gory shark kills. There was only one cool kill in the whole movie that would have been elevated if this was R- rated.

The 3D in the movie is really only good underwater. Everywhere else it's not used enough to be worth the extra price. Just don't see it in 3D.

This movie is completely predictable from start to finish. After 10 minutes, you learn who the primary characters are and you realize that they will be safe the entire movie. Everyone else except for those characters are fair game for shark attacks. And that's exactly what happens. So any suspense that they try to go for is completely useless. There is no suspense.

The filmmakers took this movie way too seriously. The way to make this movie is like Piranha 3D. Everything is ridiculous and over the top and Piranha 3D embraced that. Shark Night didn't have any fun with it's absurd qualities. Lack of fun is a big problem.

I don't really recommend Shark Night 3D.

Permalink",True,"Well, in my title for this review I mentioned Deep Blue Sea and Last House on the Left.

As far as I'm concerned this film should of never been made, well it's here and apparently by the ratings on this site it's considered garbage. How could this piece of trash get sent to the theatre, good advertising I'd say.

First of all we start out with the boring usual cocky college kids with the world in the palm if their hands, then we move onto the usual band of country bumpkins that never got over their first crush. This film is telling me that the only reason for this band of misfits and letting sharks into the salt water lake is because of a girl from years ago that he couldn't have sex with? Ney Ney I say to that. Stupid upon stupid. Then we have the so called ""Sheriff"", blending in with the teenagers that decide to go for a summer getaway at the rich girls house on an island. Well, you'd think the writers would learn this fancy dancy crap doesn't work. It didn't work in Friday the 13th remake, and it doesn't work here. Showing off your richness is so boring, and undermining. Making us all think we have to be rich, is a failure to cinema in itself.

Then we move onto the ""Black Guy"" who gets his arm bit off. How unintelligent is this? Why are they always stereotyping black people in horror, a bit racist. I'm not even black and I find this racist. How annoying. Then we catch scenes from of Lilly pads growing in the water. Talk about a bad location scout. Lilly pads don't grow in salt water.

Are we just all stupid idiots for watching this crap? Or is it that we are more intelligent in realizing that Hollywood Execs are playing us like we are zombies and have no brains? I agree with the later half.

To sum it all up. There is no reason for these sharks to be were they are, second why do all this shark re-locating? Just to be a sick twisted freak waiting for his first crush to come back? Also if there were that many sharks in the water wouldn't other people have noticed by now, and contacted wild game authorities? Surely somebody must have contacted the authorities after knowing that hundreds of sharks are in their waters. At the beginning of the film we see a girl being attacked, supposedly not noticed. But from the explanation by the local hicks they have been letting ""46"" species of sharks in the lake. This doesn't add up, if there were that many sharks somebody would have noticed by now considering how fully grown the sharks were. Once again bad writing, I think, I, along with everybody reading this review could come up with a better script. We are much smarter than these hack horror writers. I wouldn't even call them writers, my 8 year old kid could write a better story.

Well I could go on forever of what is wrong with this story, but in the end, to my logic, the actors/actresses were very good, film direction was decent, but the story lacked explanation. At least Deep Blue Sea and Last House on the Left, had meaning and explanation. This film is all over the place.

If I could give it a zero out of ten I would. A waste of my time.

Permalink",False,"I went into this movie thinking I was going to be bored to death. The only reason why we saw this was because it was a holiday, hardly anything was open and we were going stir crazy at home. I've said this before and I will say this again I love my gore, I love my violence and I love my crazy horror movies. Once you put a PG rating on something I instantly loose my interest.

After all that being said it turned out that I really enjoyed this movie. Of course I should have known this. For one I LOVE shark movies, I love teen screams, I love those goofy Sci-Fi channel horror movies with the cheese graphics. My Fiancée on the other hand did not like this movie but he never did like these sort of teeny bop things.

This movie is extremely teeny boppy, the lingo, the acting, the drama. The characters are the same hollow but hot bunch of college kids we see in all of these types of movies. So I wouldn't go in expecting anything deep from the characters or script. There was a lot of blood but it was mostly just someone being pulled under the water and buckets of blood being shown floating around them. You never actually see any gore or any attack close up.

The sharks for the most part were silly. I thought it was cool but it was very unrealistic which sort of killed it for me as well. We kept thinking the storyline would explain why these sharks were super ninja sharks. They were ridiculously fast, jumped way too high and there teeth were almost like metal'ish spikes. Apparently it was only part of the movie as they never explain anything as to why they were super sharks.

This movie was not bad IF you like this sort of thing. It wasn't particularly funny, or deep, the graphics sucked, it was rated PG but if like me you love the things I listed in the second paragraph, you may enjoy this.

Permalink",False,"Despite the sheer diversity in species that inhabit this world, Hollywood seems to have an obsession with making movies about hungry, killer sharks. Ever since Jaws debuted nearly 40 years ago, the flood gates for shark movies seemed to have been permanently forced open, allowing countless films to be made, most of which fail to come even close to Spielberg's classic. Today the latest shark disaster, Shark Night, hits the screens in all of its gore filled glory.

For those who haven't seen the overplayed trailer, Shark Night revolves around a group of Jersey Shore like teenagers taking a vacation out to an island mansion for a weekend getaway from their college studies. What starts out as a fun filled trip soon turns into chaos as Malik (Sinqua Walls) has a rough encounter with a bull shark. However this first attack is only a mild beginning as the sharks become more aggressive and fear begins to take its toll on the teenagers.

I'm going to come right out and say it, this movie is essentially Jaw meeting a teenage slasher film. Unlike Jaws, Shark night has traded plot for gore filled, teenager devouring, and CGI shark action. The acting of the victims is pretty weak for the most part, essentially focusing on incredibly shallow characters that have no morals and eventually evolved into hyperventilating chickens, with the exception of a few characters willing to tread the waters. Despite their best intentions, a majority of the scenes in this movie amounted to nothing more than a predictable sequence of chases, pointless swimming, and eventually scream filled death that is classic of a Scy-Fy original movie.

Although the plot had a little more character than what I had gotten from the trailers, it still wasn't enough to save the movie. One major weakness to the plot was how predictable the series of events was. From the moment we were introduced to the characters, I was able to predict who was going to die, and essentially how each one was going to meet their end, that is how each one was going to get eaten. You may be asking, ""Well was the explanation for why the sharks were there in the first place good?"" The answer to that question is no. In fact I believe the explanation to the sharks was one of the worst plot twists I have ever seen, more laughable than respectable. Again I wasn't expecting much of a plot, but to throw in such a twist was just pathetic to me.

Now there are some positive aspects to this movie, but I'll admit now that they are incredibly shallow positives. One positive is that the CGI work, albeit not the even close to being the greatest captures the shark movement quite well. The facts that the characters spout out about the sharks are also accurate as well and can teach the audience a few things about sharks, if they actually care. The soundtrack for this film had some catchy beats that are sure to please most modern audiences today, mainly fans of rap and hip-hop. Fans of blood will also be happy with this film as the bayou waters become stained in red by the various attacks. Finally, although the acting is weak, both male and female audience members will be happy with the eye candy most of the cast provides, as they parade around in their bikinis bathing suits. Yeah I told you these positives were pretty shallow.

To wrap this review up, Shark Night is a movie meant to kill time and provide some very cheap entertainment. Fans of constant shark attack violence will not be disappointed by this generic film, but those looking for a seemingly decent plot and suspense filled survival should avoid this film at all costs. Shark attack films may be getting old, but surely the modern movie industry can do better than this. Overall I give Shark Night, which should not be seen in 3D, a 2.0-2.5, and recommend waiting for it to come out on the Scy-Fy channel. As always provide me with some feedback and let me know your opinions and criticism for becoming a better writer."

Permalink",False,"Sara (Sara Paxton) and her college friends travel to her lake house on the Louisiana Gulf for a wild weekend of beer pong, sunbathing, and death by shark. Be mindful of the PG-13 rating because, if you go into this expecting the finned version of Aja's silicon laden Piranha 3D, you'll be sorely disappointed. The most you're going to get to feast your eyes on is a brief shot of Katharine McPhee's and Alyssa Diaz's side boobs.

It's light on the carnage and heavy on the sentimental and often over-dramatic monologues. The gore is pretty watered down for the teen/tween audience. This is neither a good thing nor a bad thing - it's a boring thing. While there are quite a few deaths, the attacks are short cut scenes that end with the camera lingering over pools of red coloring dye to signify, yep, they're dead.

What's missing from this humdinger is good ol' fashioned fun. Most of its ilk celebrate the B-movie campiness with richly funny dialog, revel in the opportunity to mock its genre, or totally go off the deep end with exaggerated kills and/or gratuitous nudity. I realize Shark Night 3D wasn't made to be an in-your-face exploitation film but it's not Open Water either. It falls to the wayside because it has no guts, literally and figuratively."

Permalink",False,"¨Terror runs deep¨

Shark Night is a terrible movie, I have to admit it, but somehow I ended up having a fun time with it. The performances are low key, the script borderlines in the ridiculous, and the story is really predictable, but in the mist of all the disaster I found myself having an enjoyable experience. Shark Night is a movie that takes its subject matter very lightly, it doesn't try to be a serious horror film, or even try to show a lot of gore or being scary. It's a movie that recognizes its limitations and plays along with it. What makes this bad movie stand out from the rest is that it ends up being bad in a good way, in other words it makes you laugh because it's so bad. The plot is so bad that it seems that director David R. Ellis decided to just play along with the audience and let us have a good time without having to make the film gory or extremely violent. He gives us a lot of sharks, a lot of kills, and if taken lightly like the producers want you to you might end up having a good time like I did. If you are expecting a scary movie with a lot of gore than I warn you stay away from Shark Night because it's just a light comedy with some bad acting and bad special effects. If you go into this movie expecting nothing else than that, just like I did, then you might end up having a decent time. One thing is for sure: screenwriters Will Hayes and Jesse Studenberg won't be winning any awards for their dumbed down script.

It's time to explain my least favorite part of the film: the plot. Shark Night takes place in a lake near the Louisiana Gulf coast (yes you read right, there are sharks in a lake and there is a perfectly good reason for that). A group of teenagers decide to go to Sara's (Sara Paxton) lake house to celebrate Malik's (Sinqua Walls) recent success in an exam that will allow him to enter college. His friends Nick (Dustin Milligan) and Gordon (Joel David Morse) were the ones who helped him study so in order to thank them he brings them along although they aren't part of the cool group. At the house Malik plans to propose to his girlfriend Maya (Alyssa Diaz). Beth (Katharine McPhee) and Blake (Chris Zylka) also decide to go along with the rest of the gang and have some fun at the lake. Before arriving to the house however they have a small quarrel with a pair of local hillbillies Red (Joshua Leonard) and Dennis (Chris Carmack) with whom Sara is acquainted with, but everything goes on as normal. At the lake they meet the Sheriff, Sabin (Donal Logue), who greets them warmly and even has a couple of drinks with them. The kids are ready to have a great time and begin enjoying the lake, but what they don't know is that the lake is infested with sharks. What begins as innocent fun, ends up being a nightmare for Sara and her friends.

The actors are all relatively unknown and there is a good reason for that (they aren't exactly great actors), but you can't have a shark film without hot young teens. The movie really works better as a comedy than as a horror film because the plot is just ridiculous, but I did have a fun time with how the shark attacks were exaggerated. There was one scene were a shark jumps several feet over the water and eats one of the kids that is riding a motorbike. These sharks were just so exaggerated that you couldn't help but laugh at the silliness of each scene. There are several more death scenes like this which are hugely exaggerated and I found quite funny. There is no gore because Shark Attack had a PG-13 rating so don't expect much of the death scenes from the Final Destination producers. I haven't seen the Piranhas film so I can't make comparisons with it, but I heard this is nothing like the gore that film had, so if you want a stronger film or expect something like Piranhas then skip this film because you will be disappointed. Shark Night has nothing memorable to it, but I did have a surprisingly good time with it so I got to give it a passing grade, although the lowest possible one.

Permalink",False,"About this time last year, I saw a movie called ""Piranha."" It was a loose remake of a 1978 cult favorite produced by Roger Corman; the sort of cheesy B-movie that was so laughably bad that it ascended to being good fun. That was, of course, the original film, not the remake, which made it onto my list of the worst movies of 2010. Now, exactly one year later, my hopes for seeing a good creature-feature on the silver screen have once again been crushed by what was, essentially, the exact same picture I saw last fall. The only difference is, now the obnoxious, hard-to-endure stick-figure characters are being munched on by big fake CGI sharks instead of big fake CGI piranhas.

But it's really the same scenario. Some brainless young adults are frolicking about on a big, freshwater lake when all of a sudden, people are being tossed about and pulled under by unseen attackers. About thirty minutes in, it's revealed (as if we didn't already know) that the lake has been infested by sharks. And not just great whites, either. No, there are hammerheads, tiger sharks, bulls, and even cookie-cutters. How are all of these oceanic species ending up in a freshwater lake? Well, the movie gives an explanation, but it's one of the most outrageously bad plot twists in recent years. And remember, I'm an aficionado on the junk monster movies that pop up on the SyFy Channel every weekend. Now, I do not go to a monster movie looking for great character study or plot logistics. I go there looking for good old-fashioned, escapist fun. Only when a B-movie becomes so incredibly empty and devoid of joy do I start nitpicking on things I might otherwise overlook until after the credits have rolled. But the writing and directing of ""Shark Night"" (which by the way, mostly takes place under a bright sunny sky) is so bland, so unenthusiastic, so absent-minded that it left me looking at my watch after about twenty minutes. After the first attack sequence, which starts with a predictable twist and then becomes a practical shot-for-shot knock-off from the all-more-effective opening scene in ""Jaws,"" the only thing that ran through my mind was wondering how long it would be before Steven Spielberg and Universal decided to pitch out a lawsuit for copyright infringement.

The whole movie looks and feels very much like it was made directly for a television release, giving it a sort of schizophrenic, out-of-place feeling. The fact that the performances are beneath comment does not help any, since they are on screen far more often than the cartoony, computer-generated sharks who can twist their necks as flexibly as a human arm and snarl like lions. In addition, there is the other big problem that I also had with ""Piranha"": dopey exploitation. The movie's far more interested in ogling at the hindquarters and torsos of partially-naked models-turned-'actors' than it is in developing plausible attack scenarios or engaging the audience in the way only a good B-movie can.

Well, at least there weren't any underwater lesbian scenes this time. No chewed up, sex organs either. Thank heaven.

If the writers had realized that they were making a movie for the big screen and not for television, ""Shark Night"" might have proved to be a solid, lighthearted matinée. Instead, it fails to recognize what it ought to have been and pretends to be a grade-A exploitation flick, falling flat from the beginning. In regards to its 3D: it's thoroughly unimpressive. Granted, I am not the biggest fan of 3D; I think it's a cheap, unengaging gimmick. But half the time, you wouldn't know this were a 3D movie if it weren't for the bulky glasses sitting on your nose. It's still murky and nothing jumps out from the screen except for a few pieces from a motorboat and some seaweeds. Not scary, not entertaining, not even remotely interesting, ""Shark Night"" was one of the more unhappy times I've had at the movies.

It seems like the only folks who can still produce good monster flicks are the Japanese. Their contemporary rubber monsters smashing miniature Tokyos and Osakas are far more interesting than any monster mayhem I've seen on the big screen in a long while."

Permalink",True,"I tend to not review movies when they are in theaters. I think it's better to do so when said movie is on DVD-I dunno why, I just do. So when I saw ""Shark Night"" in 2011, I knew it would be bad-so bad it ended up in my ""worst of the year list"", but until now, I've held out on reviewing it. So now that said movie is now available on the home market, let's get this show on the road.

Sara Palski (the adorable Sara Paxton) and her pals Malik (Sinqua Walls), Gordon (Joel David Moore), Beth (former ""American Idol"" contestant Katherine McPhee), Nick (Dustin Mulligan) Blake (Chris Zykla) and Maya (Alyssa Diaz) go on vacation at a lake house in Louisiana. In the process, then run into redneck goons Dennis (Chris Carmack) and Red (""Blair Witch Project"" actor Joshua Leonard, whose found a fine second life in the world of indie and art house movies) and seemingly nice sheriff Greg Sabin (Donal Logue.) The big danger however, is that the fresh water lake has sharks-and that the rednecks might have something to do with them being there.

It's weird to see that David R. Ellis directed this. Here is a man who previously directed ""Snakes on a Plane"", ""Final Destination 2"" and the fourth one. Here's a guy who knows how to take a potentially fun concept and run with it (well, not with ""The Final Destination"", but beggars can't be choosers.) Here however, the movie plays the whole concept straight, with little in the way of personality, humor or thrills. It's a shark movie without any life-one that's so lame, even the folks at The Asylum would raise their noses at it. The whole thing is directed lifelessly, with no potential fun on display. The movie instead goes with one of the biggest cardinal sins in horror-it plays it safe.

Granted, part of that could probably be blamed on the PG-13 rating. It's obvious that the movie is trying to ride the coattails of movies like ""Piranha 3D."" When you see a movie called ""Shark Night"", you immediately expect coeds being munched on, female nudity and tons of gore. With a PG-13 rating, it loses much of the impact it could have. Another advantage something like ""Piranha"" has over this is the fact that it was aware of it's own ridiculousness, and fully embraced it. This is a movie that has potential to be a commentary on reality television with its ""Rednecks use sharks to make a bloody web show"" sub-plot, but instead it just becomes a morass of bad stereotypes and tiresome torture-horror tropes.

Even more offensive is that much of the cast is actually made up of good actors. I've seen shows and movies where Leonard, Paxton, Moore and Logue (who starred in the sadly short lived FX series ""Terriers"") have delivered good to great performances. Seeing them in this is just depressing. I know they are better than this, and yes, I'm aware that a job is a job at the end of the day and that actors have to make cash. But it's sad to see the wasted in crap like this.

There is no reason whatsoever to watch ""Shark Night"", as it has plenty of sharks and no sense of fun. Besides, if you are going to make PG-13 movie with sharks, make it about about a superhero shark, and call it ""The Shark Knight.""

Permalink",True,"Seven students go to spend a holiday on the luxury holiday home of one of the girls: it sits on its own island in the Florida everglades. And they are having a lovely time when the first shark attack comes.

This film is essentially someone stalking the dorm wiping out students one by one, except it is sharks not slashers, and the students are all in their bathers. There is a completely preposterous plot development halfway through, then another even more preposterous plot development building on the first one, and an utterly idiotic final shot. The cast are all unknown and, regrettably, this movie is unlikely to change that for any of them. Much of the shark antics are ripped bodily from Jaws. This is the sort of movie which used to be made for the direct-to-video market, pumped up by 3D.

On the plus side, it is pretty to look at with attractive scenery, the girls look nice in bikinis, there are six-packs on view for the ladies, the 3D is sometimes effective, and CGI sharks have come on a long way. And there is a shot halfway through featuring a shark and a jetski which made me laugh out loud (it wasn't meant to, I don't think).

Permalink",True,"I saw the opening midnight show last night. At that point there were 2 reviews, both saying how great and gory/bloody it was. That's the films biggest problem, the LACK of gore! I wasn't going to see this film for a great story- I went to see sharks attacking and eating people. All you ever see is someone getting pulled under the water and then some blood (usually very little!) surface, there are no shark attacks on camera. Its a shame because the cast was all good for what it was. It was cheesy and fun, but with each attack (meaning one less kill left of the not to large group) i was disappointed because you Don't SEE AN ATTACK! It's entertaining enough, with a fun cast, but know going into this film that you aren't getting ANY gore, and not too much actual ""shark time"" on screen. If that's okay with you, then you will enjoy it :) Otherwise wait for the inevitable unrated blu ray.

If you do go- STAY UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS!!! If you don't already know whats coming, get ready to laugh and like the cast a little bit more :)

PS The 3D was excellent, especially the underwater shots...

When Malik is skiing in the lake, he has a severed arm by a shark and his friends seek for help. But sooner they learn that the lake is infested of different species of sharks and they have a more dangerous problem threatening them.

""Shark Night 3D"" is a silly and absurd rip-off ""Jaws"" with the storyline that recalls ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", with a group of youngsters that travels to the countryside and are slaughtered by sharks. They are actually victims of a gang of psychopaths that make money in a website with snuff movies showing the sharks attacking and killing people. Chris Carmack is scary with his psychotic behavior but the film is dull, ridiculous and the special effects are very poor. But maybe the greatest problem is that ""Shark Night 3D"" is a B-movie with the pretension of being a serious movie. My vote is four.

Permalink",False,"Don't watch this film it is nothing more than a predictable teen slash movie. Bad acting, bad story (with no actual reasoning) and just simply ridiculous plot. I for one think that since the iconic jaws films were released, too many people have tried to replicate the success of said films. The problem is that these shark films try to be something they aren't. How this film passes as a horror I'll never know, not once was I startled, jumped or scared. The posters built expectations which could not be met. I wanted this film to end long before it did and, in general was a mix of both happy and frustrated to see the credits. Happy because this lame film was over and frustrated because I then realised that watching this film was an utter waste of time. It's not very often that you watch a shark film and wish for less action and more development but, that's what happened with this film. Overall to put it simply, I spent more time gazing off into the distance than I spent watching the screen on the edge of my seat.

Permalink",False,"The reviews I encountered on ""Shark Night 3D"" around here, whether coming from die-hard horror fanatics or not, are not at all favorable and I honestly don't fully understand why. Alright, obviously the film is heavily flawed and occasionally quite dumb, but as far as shark movies of the past two (or even three) decades go, this one definitely ranks amongst the most adequate ones! I'm a big shark fanatic and try to watch everything that comes out on the subject, regardless of how awful they sometimes are. Now I don't know about you, but the latest shark flicks I've seen are either lame melodramas based on true stories (""Open Water"", ""The Reef"") OR taking place at the most ludicrous of locations (in Venice or in Tsunami-struck areas) OR dealing with imbecilic hybrid creatures and/or genetically altered species (""Dinoshark"", ""Sharktopus"") So yes, call me soft and gentle perhaps, but I was reasonably pleased with the straightforward shark action and relatively refreshing plot of this ""Shark Night 3D"".

""Shark Night"" opens like any other clichéd horror flick, namely with a bunch of teenagers heading off to a sunny lake house for a holiday full of water sports, alcohol and hormones in overdrive. One of the party teens, the hot blond Sarah Palski, grew up in the offbeat Louisianan beach community across the lake and knows that the local boys – including her ex – are often involved in delinquent affairs. Soon after their arrival, the teens fall victim to deadly accidents caused by various species of  sharks! Why there are tiger sharks, hammerheads and even great whites in a freshwater lake? The explanation is grotesque and slightly preposterous, but most definitely entertaining. The teen protagonists are your typical gathering of stereotypes (black macho, geek, hot Latina, etc) and the dialogs are of abominable quality, but again, if you're expecting sheer poetry or intelligent intrigues, then you only have yourself to blame for the disappointment. The killings are fairly innovative, some more than others of course, with a more than impressive jet-ski jump moment as a highlight. The special effects aren't too shocking, presumably due to the PG-13 certificate, and the film doesn't necessarily benefice a lot from the 3D treatment. Just fun, preferably in combination with beer and buddies."

Permalink",False,"I know that sounds harsh, but although the trailer made Shark Night 3D made it look like another SyFy movie I wanted to see what it was like, as I like films like these when they are done right. However, Shark Night 3D was just a mess.

There are only two good things for me. The underwater sequences do look stunning. Also, the lead Sara Paxton is good, the only actress who connects with her character and the only engaging character.

Everything else? What can I say? The cinematography and editing were good in the underwater sequences, but haphazard in the attacks. The sharks really looked terribly clunky, and there is no suspense or realism here or in the build ups.

Shark Night 3D isn't much fun either. The dialogue is cheesy in an eye rolling sense and the story is the personification of dumb especially in the final third where the film completely falls apart in its credibility and did I mention how contrived it was. The characters are stereotypical and I didn't care for any of them by the end, the direction is unfocused pretty much throughout and the acting apart from Paxton was either overplayed or bland.

In conclusion, dumb, contrived, badly acted, cheesy, stereotypical, with badly done sharks and a complete suspense lack of suspense and fun. Paxton and the underwater sequences are its only worthwhile assets. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

Permalink",False,"This movie is just as irresponsible as the horrible ""torture porn"" seen in recent years. In this movie, we are still subjected to the most malevolent of human behavior, but they use sharks instead of saws, cages and bondage. And make damn sure we mutilate young adults while they are barely dressed so we can become aroused by the beauty of the human body and then become horrified at the dismemberment. It never ceases to amaze me what incredibly horrific visions today's young filmmakers can dream up. Even more pathetic, someone is paying them to do it. When the audience finally says ""no I won't watch this tasteless, senseless waste of talent and money,"" perhaps they will stop making it.

Not likely, unfortunately.

Permalink",True,"""Shark Night 3-D"" bites! Unfortunately, ""Snakes on a Plane"" director David R. Ellis plays everything straight in ""Shark Night 3-D."" Meaning, you had better prepare yourself for clichés galore without a smirk in sight. This derivative, PG-13 rated, 91-minute, yarn concerns three stereotypical, mean-spirited rednecks who drool at the chance to feed stuck-up college kids to ravenous sharks of all sizes. Of course, most of the ocean's deadly predators prefer to prowl the briny blue, but these three rednecks have an illegal device that enables them to paralyze these predators, attach mini-cams, relocate them to a Louisiana salt-lake, and then wait for them to start chomping. Furthermore, they plan to make big bucks by selling their shark snuff videos to die-hard ""Shark Week"" addicts after the real thing. Think of ""Shark Night 3-D"" as ""Jaws"" trying to meet ""8MM."" Everybody sports serious expressions because everything is serious. Nevertheless, everybody behaves like idiots, too. A one-armed college jock with a spear wades into a shark-infested lake with revenge in his heart. Hammerheads, threshers, cookie cutters and bull sharks assemble to make munch-meat of him. Sadly, not only are these sharks either digitally concocted or animatronic, but they also act like SyFy Channel sharks. SyFy Channel made-for-cable movies usually boast sharks that move so quickly they resemble cartoon sharks. The synthetic ""Shark Night 3-D"" sharks swim with such speed that our heroes, when the latter have either a boat with an outboard motor or water bike at their disposal, cannot leave them in their wake! An academically challenged Tulane University athlete, Malik (Sinqa Walls of ""Choose Connor""), makes a B+ on a test and no longer worries about flunking out of college. An ecstatic Malik rewards his dutiful tutor, Nick (Dustin Milligan of ""Final Destination 3""), along with Nick's nerdy roommate Gordon (Joel David Moore of ""Avatar"") to join his friends for a good time at a remote lakeside estate. Sara (Sara Paxton of ""Superhero Movie"") has wealthy parents who own a beautiful cottage secluded on an island which is surrounded by a sprawling salt-water lake. Naturally, nobody with a cell phone can raise a signal at Lake Crosby. Furthermore, the nearest hospital lies about two hours away. Little do our recreationally minded heroes know the ill-fate which awaits them. Meantime, Malik tries to play Cupid and get Nick and Sara together. As Malik tells Nick, Sara has not been on a date in three years. Later we learn why. Anyway, Nick and Sara grow chummy and Nick winds up steering Sara's launch. While Nick is playing admiral, he has show-off Malik at the end of a tether skiing around the lake on a board. Malik impresses everybody with his incredible gymnastic feats. He loves to perform flips. Suddenly, Malik feels something ram his board, and he takes a tumble. A shark attacks Malik and tears off his right arm at the bicep. Our heroes bandage Malik and rush him to the hospital. Malik's blood drips into the lake and another shark slams into the launch so that Malik's soon-to-be wife, Maya (Alyssa Diaz of TV's ""Southland""), topples into the water and gets gobbled up. Later, Malik traipses into the lake with nothing more than his rage and a spear. He kills a hammerhead shark and dies. The two rednecks, Sara's ex-boyfriend, scar-faced Dennis (Chris Carmack of ""Into the Blue 2: The Reef), and his tattooed sidekick, Red (Joshua Leonard of ""Hatchet""), offer to help Sara and her friends. Beth is so sickened by the tragic turn of events that she wants to ride with Dennis and Red back to the mainland. Gordon refuses to let Beth travel alone with them. Neither realizes the mistake that both make when they set foot on the redneck's boat. Before it is all over with heroic Nick has to tangle with murderous Dennis and a shark.

Basically, ""Shark Night 3-D"" amounts to a complicated but predictable revenge thriller with nothing to recommend it. Freshmen scenarists Will Hayes and Jesse Studenberg neither do Ellis nor the audience any favors with their shallow screenplay that borrows extensively from other shark movies. Their dialogue is utterly flat without any flair. The characters emerge as one-dimensional nitwits waiting for their moment to be eaten. Ellis does deserve some credit for keeping the action moving at a brisk headlong pace. Nevertheless, he fails to generate any sympathy for our clueless heroes. The villains could be cousins of the rednecks in ""Deliverance."" All of the ersatz shark attacks have been lensed before with greater realism in better movies. The 3-D technology delivers in only two scenes. The first involves an exploding boat hurling shrapnel, while the second shows a shark as its gory innards are blasted out of it. Considering the $28-million budget, you'd think they could have made more than one shark appear convincing. A bull shark does look supremely menacing in a scene straight out of the James Bond feature ""License to Kill,"" but the rest look simulated and swim like torpedoes. Two sharks literally defy gravity by leaping out of the lake to chomp. A first girl caught alone in the lake is straight out of the original ""Jaws"" as well as the attack on a hapless skier is straight out of the ""Jaws 2."" If you want to watch a good shark thriller, and you cannot find ""Jaws,"" then you might try ""Deep Blue Sea"" (1999), or the straight-to-video, outlandish ""Shark Attack 3: Megalodon"" (2002) and ""Shark Swarm"" (2008). The PG-13 rating rules out any chance of nudity, and the ability of sharks that can race through the water after speedboats eliminates any sense of credibility. Ellis generates a modicum of suspense when swimmers struggle to out-swim the sharks, but not enough to scare the daylights out of you.

""Shark Night 3-D"" is munch-ado-about-gnaw-thing!

THIS is a good TRASH movie, 100 times better than ""Machete"", ""Hobo with a shotgun"" and similar (soft) horror flicks ... I guess the problem must be that it isn't 100% OBVIOUSLY stated that this is a TRASH MOVIE, like in afore mentioned two, so today's Average Joe's in audience couldn't figure it out by themselves. That's why I use UPPERCASE LETTERS, because most of you Joe Schmoe's doesn't even read whole reviews.

I say, this movie is at least better than the average of it's genre. Classic example of ""expedition gone wrong"" horror storyline. Small group of friends on isolated island, getting dispatched one by one. There's even a twist in the plot. If only camera and editing were more dynamic, let's say for example, like in ""My Super Psycho Sweet 16: Part 2"", this movie could've been even awesome.

""Shark Night 3D"" is the worst shark picture to come out since ""Jaws: The Revenge"" sunk audiences back in 1987 and scared them away from going to the theatre to see a shark movie. ""Deep Blue Sea"" reminded us to stay away and""Piranha 3D"" was considerably bad but this picture shows that the shark movies are long outdated and dead in the water. I knew this going to be bad but I didn't think it would be as terrible as it is. This film is just awful in every aspect.

It's about a group of university graduates, Sara (Sara Paxton) and who the hell cares, who drive to Sara's family vacation home on a private lake. When one the kids goes wake-boarding, he is attacked by a shark and loses his arm. Realising the lake is infested with sharks, they attempt to get to the mainland before they become lunch.

That was an easy plot to get through mainly because I don't care about anyone of anything in this picture. Thanks to a faulty PG-13 rating, the gore is reduced and the nudity is cut out. I walk into every film expecting something out of it but I got nothing from this but a headache. I had a hard time trying to figure out what the title of the film means? What the hell is a Shark Night? The 3D aspect is to rip audiences off, even more, most of them paying 12 dollars to see this and we are left with one of the worst films in the last 30 years. I think this might be more stupid than ""Jaws: The Revenge."" I use it because its fabled for being a terrible film that Universal Pictures road off. It's so easy to compare the films but I think this trash might be more stupid in terms of intelligence.

Do You remember in ""Friday the 13th Part III"" when the van died and the woman becomes trapped and must fight Jason in the barn? Now in the digital age, cell phones lose service and the characters must find a way out of the situation. In this case, it's driving a boat on the water and hoping they don't become lunch. It's very hard to confuse me with a movie but I had to ask myself the question ""how does one get the idea to feed college kids to sharks simply by watching the discovery channel?"" While, they try to make sense of that by using the digital age as a backdrop. The moron villains of the film have dumped the sharks into the lake with cameras attached to the bellies in an attempt to show snuff films on the internet. I don't feel bad that I ruined that and I might reveal the end of the picture because this is as close as I hope you get to seeing this film.

None of the characters prevail in any form and are simply shark bait. The screenwriter of the film couldn't have worked very hard to write something decent and his decision to write a screenplay where the film is taken seriously as a slasher film is laughable. I can't begin to believe a major motion picture like this could be greenlit or maybe I can. With the rise of recent 3D movies, it's no surprise that this was conjured up as a means the suck the dollar out of the average moviegoers. Why not, 3D failed to save the ""Jaws"" series back in 1983 and since 3D is too expensive, post-production 3D is cheaper, hence ripping off audiences more who will pay to see this. Even the 3D to the film is bad. There are two aspects: 3D above the water and 3D under the water. The depth of field under the water is so sharp, it will give you a serious headache.

Sara Paxton is wasted in the film as the one who is supposed to have brains, none of them do, but it's the stupidity of the characters that really took me by surprise. Why would you swim out into shark infested water to retrieve your friends arm after he was just attacked? Furthermore, why would anyone arm themselves with a harpoon and venture into the water to attack the shark that ate your girlfriend? you might get eaten you know. The sharks look worse than anything in this picture. They look absurd and one of them leaps out of the water and attacks someone on a jet-ski. It's worse than it sounds, trust me. By the second act, you know the moron villain, Dennis (Chris Carmack) and Sara have a history together and it will serve as the climax of the film.

If you haven't figured out the ending yet, don't worry because It doesn't matter. I have decided not to ruin the ending, although it's very tempting but with a film as stupid as this, you can figure it out for yourself. When we learn the revelation, it's enough to make you want to get up and leave because we have had a horrible time. As pitiful as this film is, it speaks volumes about Hollywood as well. If they are willing to greenlight a cash grab film such as this, it shows the they are willing to easily rip off the unsuspecting moviegoers and that's about as despicable as this trash film is. Save you hard earned money, you will be thankful.

Permalink",False,"This shark attack thriller directed by David R. Ellis follows a group of Tulane University students who head off to spend their spring break at a lake house at the Louisiana Gulf. What starts off as a relaxing vacation turns into a nightmare when one of their friends trails out of the water with one of his arms torn off by what they first believe to be an injury from a skiing accident. It quickly turns out to be a result of a shark attack. With a large group of sharks lurking around the lake and no signal for help available, these seven college kids are faced with unimaginable terror as they fight to survive against the massacre of hungry sharks and authorities who reveal to be who they appear to be. Featuring the cast of Sara Paxton, Katharine McPhee, Dustin Milligan, Chris Carmack, Joel David Moore, Chris Zylka, Alyssa Diaz, Donal Logue, Sinqua Walls, and Joshua Leonard; this creature thriller borrow elements from movies like 'Jaws' and uses him with poor execution and sloppy direction.

This creature feature was already targeted with criticism before its release when it first received its PG-13 rating, much to the dismay of horror fans who were expecting to experience the blood and gory fun that creature films are often known for. As a result, the film is neutered down to gore-less shark attacks. Jaws received a PG rating at the time of its release, but that is only because the PG- 13 rating was not available at the time. The blood and gore displayed in that 1975 classic would definitely be slapped with a PG-13 today, if not an R. Suffering from lazy execution, this film is not only depraved of its blood and gory fun and solid written characters, but it completely empty of any sort of suspense. The movie is never scary nor is manage to be suspenseful, and instead treats viewers with dirt cheap thrills that fall of the horror aspect. When a character is attacked by a shark, all that is seen blood filling up the water with the character's offscreen demise, no suspense associated with these scenes.

Now lets discuss the plot and the characters. With the lazing writing by Will Hayes and Jesse Studenberg, the characters feel so wooden and underdeveloped that you don't really care for any of them, and the plot doesn't do much to redeem this. The first half focuses on the teenagers trying to fight against the sharks after one of them is attacked and another one gets eaten. Then the second the half deals with the characters being taken hostage by men played by Chris Carmack and Jimmy Lee Jr. who reveal to be mindless savages trying to feed them to the sharks. From there on, the plot falls into extreme inconsistency and ceases to make sense.

Shark Night is a terrible excuse of a horror film, and is way too watered down for its own good. The thin characters, poor plot, and overall sloppy script make this film far too difficult to recommend thanks to its PG-13 rating."

Permalink",True,"OK, so if you are expecting a movie about what sharks are really like and real shark attacks, this is clearly not a movie to watch. Nor does it have that feel to it like Jaws did that any of this could really happen. I mean the movie is filled with FLYING sharks. The sharks are rather small, only about 10 feet long. No way a shark that small with attack a human in real life unless it's absolutely desperate. And baby sharks only a foot long acting like piranha? Not in real life. But hey, It's nothing compared to the fact that sharks in this movie: have radar, similar to submarines that allows them to track movements above water just as well as under are super intelligent can perform complex geometric and physics computations to plot optimal intercept course if a human (their favorite meal) somehow gets out of the water, just jump out after him as much as 6 feet up and as long as it takes really can swim at 50 miles an hour, for 20 minutes or possibly longer don't really eat but just bite repeatedly if a piece of human, like an arm, is bitten off, it's promptly spat out, so the shark is still hungry and can go after the next victim without pausing. I think if all else fails, the sharks may have been equipped with torpedoes but that's just my theory. But sharks are not the only ones who can perform miracles. A one armed guy who was just unconscious from all the blood loss manages to stab a shark in the water with one hand while been chewed on. Girls in the movie have radar too. They can miraculously locate the direction of the camera which they don't even know is there. Then they turn away from it in unison (and towards a window) take off their tops to put on bikinis.

Anyhow, this is not at all a serious movie. But it's so... so... cheesy that i think I am giving it 6/10 as being kinda a comedy. I mean a little more tweaking and they could make it into a good parody spoof of some bad shark movies.

Permalink",False,"Trying to have a relaxing weekend trip on a freshwater lake, a group of friends finds the festivities ruined by the repeated attacks by a group of sharks placed in the lake by exploitative fishermen and must try to get out alive.

Frankly, this is one of the more disappointing and frustrating efforts to come along since there's so much here that could've been made great that instead turns this into a rather pedestrian affair. One of the biggest lapses of all is the complete and utter stupidity and lameness regarding the plot which has several humongous holes in it. Besides the fact that most of the species chosen pose no threat to man and don't eat meat in their diet yet do so here, one of the biggest is the fact that the sharks featured are all fresh-water creatures and can't survive in fresh-water, of which we're told repeatedly that it is, yet there's nothing that states why the sharks are able to thrive as long as this one states as the operation is evidently running smoothly for quite a while. As for why it's gone so long unnoticed manages to uncover it's biggest non-surprise plot-twist later on almost right from the beginning with the surprise helper in the operation uncovered right from the moment this is found out, and thereby forces the film to go on far longer than it should with scenes clearly shown simply to beef up the running time and keep the group in danger beyond all sense of realism since the first gimmick part to this clearly isn't strong enough to support a full-length film without a lot of extra help in order to keep them in the water, and because they're being forced into the water by others rather than faced with no alternative and must be there to begin with, it really takes the fear out of the sharks because they're only the lapdogs of someone else and don't have a mind of their own, making for a rather piddly sense of fear from them. On top of that, we're faced with utterly atrocious CGI for the sharks that don't in the slightest portray any sense of realism or hide this computerized nature, and the 3D effects are pretty much the same exact gag repeated over and over of the shark swimming open-mouthed at someone from out of nowhere which really wears thin after a while. While there's some fine attack scenes in here, including a marina explosion, a frantic race to get to a safety dock in the water and a water-ski chase through a lagoon providing both action and some suspense that proved it could've handled some fun scenes here and there, overall this one was a terrible disappointment.

Rated PG-13: Graphic Violence, Language, Brief Nudity, drug use and animals-in-danger."

Permalink",False,"A movie where the bad guys are more likable than the 'good guys'. Some dismiss it as another Jaws rip-off and while the opening scene feels familiar, Shark Night is a homage to Discovery Channel's Shark Week; which in turn owes a lot to Jaws so ... uh, yeah. Okay, you can't really make a shark movie without some comparison to Jaws. The sharks look great, the kills looked great, and Katharine McPhee (American Idol) looks really great. Unfortunately the unlikeable characters too often stop to chat it up and it kills the pacing. The first rule in film school should be: Never burden inexperienced actors with excessive dialog. A more tightly edited Shark Night 3D would be considerably re-watchable. After all, the filmmakers and presumably many viewers are fans of Shark Week, we came for the bloodletting not teen melodrama. Stick around after the credits for a funny little rap video by the cast.

Permalink",False,"With a movie having a name with the word '' shark '' in it two things are guaranteed to make me go to the cinema hall---

.........one is the cheap thrills that one gets by seeing some blood curdling sharks with even more stomach turning teeth tear some innocent victims to pieces.....

......and the other is the presence of some water body like the sea or the ocean where the sharks live ; a water body that is guaranteed to make goodlooking girls take off their clothes and go swimming nearly naked into the sea.....

Now which of these two things makes me more willing to go to the movie ??

Clue to the puzzle---I am a lecherous man

So off I went to the cinema hall to feast my eyes on some mouthwatering bodies and even more mouthwatering blood and gore....

And the director of '' Final destination '' didn't disappoint---in fact the movie is more like a mini horror movie rather than a thriller.....

So a group of good looking guys and hot chicks go to an island in the middle of a lake for a holiday.....

But the girl who brings them there is a mysterious one ; she's a local and she's got a past she would rather not talk about.....

And as they move to the place they encounter trouble with some locals who turn out to be the girl's friends.....

......And the locals seem to be mean guys---one of them even has a scar running up his face , while the other is a bucktoothed drunkard.....

The sheriff though seems to be friendly enough....or is he ??

Things certainly mysterious out there.....

But nothing is meaner than the sharks....

.....And deadly trouble erupts as the sharks begin to kill the holidayers one by one.....

But wait.....

How come the sharks came into the lake ?? Did they come by themselves or someone put them there ??

But put a hold on your questions---out there people are dying and the holidayers are trapped on the island as the sharks kill anyone trying to get off the island.....

Meanwhile you get some enjoyable chills and thrills as the sharks jump out of the screen to seemingly lunge at you due to 3D effects.....

So who's gonna survive the feeding frenzy of the sharks ??

Go and watch the movie for that....

I found it a decent watch....

Verdict---good for some thrills ."

Permalink",True,"Seven friends load swimsuits and beer for a weekend at an island beach-house in the Louisiana Gulf. Debauchery turns into one hell-of-a nightmare few will survive. One of the friends loses an arm in what appears to be a skiing accident. Before the blame is laid on thick it is discovered that the waters are infested with toothy and vicious sharks. The shocked vacationers in their panic will seek help for the wounded and get in touch with the local sheriff(Donal Logue), who actually has teamed with some area good old boys to terrorize the college kids. The trailers will suck you into this shark frenzy. The highlight for many will be the chance to almost see the lovely Katharine McPhee(of American Idol notoriety) get undressed. Some pretty grisly scenes of hungry sharks doing what they do. This movie is too much like so many others. Included in the cast: Sara Paxton, Dustin Milligan, Sinqua Walls, Christine Quinn, Alyssa Diaz and Chris Carmack. I'm not saying this isn't fun to watch.

Permalink",True,"Look, I try to give any movie, like the PG-13 Shark Night 3 D, the benefit of the doubt despite this preconceived notion that it will probably stink. For a lot of horror fans, shark movies are like chum, we see blood, or the potential of blood, in the water with a ravenous, man-eating water predator on the rampage, as petite female and buff male bodies serve as menu options, and we can't help ourselves. I put the blame on Spielberg and Peter Benchley with Jaws. Every since this 77 classic hit theaters, VHS, and DVD, horror fans seem attracted to the recycled killer shark formula.

In the bayou, Tulane students go on a summer trip to one of the group's (Sara Paxton) lake estate and for some reason sharks of all varieties are loose and hungry. Anytime college kids go to a lake summer home it's a recipe for disaster, especially with freaky rednecks and a fishing trawler who are secretly killing off victims for an internet reality snuff program filming the murders for the audience willing to pay top dollar. CGI sharks galore and PG-13 violence, Shark Night (which takes place primarily during the day which tells you right away that all is not right with this movie) eschews the usual booze-partying and sex, having the African American star linebacker (Sinqua Walls) losing an arm while wave-riding gets hurt by a shark right away. Losing blood fast, he needs to go to a hospital, but the group is out in the middle of bayou country so their predicament is grave, to say the least. Chris Carmack and Joshua Leonard (the latter recognizable to fans of The Blair Witch Project) are a pair of repellent hick creeps who seem to be just antagonists, at first, later revealing their sinister natures to great length at the expense of former American Idol star Katharine McPhee (groomed for stardom for the NBC Broadway series, SMASH) and wise-cracking Joel David Moore (fun during his time in the movie). The huge sharks leap out of the water as if they were dolphins. None of the characters, including Paxton (the movie goes out of its way to establish that she is now a woman, as Sara remains in bikini practically the entire running time, not that I'm complaining, but it is rather apparent), are that interesting (I know, the characters service the film as chum for the water predators, but still I would like to have some sort of interest in their welfare), but Dustin Mulligan (as the handsome nerd who is Paxton's love interest) is rather resourceful and crafty (of course, the film has to have the ""final guy"" to come to the rescue of the ""final girl""). I was quite amused at the convenience of having a zippo lighter when Mulligan faced being tiger shark lunch, and he seems able to swim freely throughout without barely a hint of danger. That's the problem, I don't think anyone believes (I sure didn't) that Paxton or Mulligan, despite the stack decked against them, will fall to either the Bayou scumbags or the sharks they ""planted in the lake"". Walls' behavior (going after a shark in revenge for the death of his sweetie or untying his body after his jet-skiing bro was about to get him to shore), in particular, is flat stupid, and the villains seem to talk on and on as Paxton and Mulligan could have been annihilated in quick and brutal fashion. The movie will fall quickly out of the minds of those who watch it, I think, because nothing about it is particularly that memorable except the villains who, to their credit (Joshua is a real Redneck freakshow, with teeth and hygiene, and filthy manners, the stand-out)certain to make your skin crawl. The violence doesn't come close to the bloody goods delivered by Aja just recently with his Piranha remake, proving here that tame CGI blood and lack of on screen grue doesn't help matters, either. Teasing the typical audience by having your female eye candy removing their tops with their backs to the camera so you are left to imagine what their boobs look like just further illustrates that Shark Night is all about not delivering instead of giving the usual fans what they expect.

Permalink",False,"I'm a huge fan of B-grade movies. When I heard that a ""Shark Night 3D"" was coming out I was interested. And after seeing the trailer that had Sara Paxton in the underwater cage for a moment, I immediately wanted to see it. Also, I'm a big fan of both Cellular and Snakes on a Plane, which are both also directed by David R. Ellis, so I thought that this movie really had potential. I know that many reviewers dislike the PG-13 rating, and while it did limit the film, personally I wouldn't really say that was the main problem. The real problem with this movie in my opinion is that it can't make up its mind as to what it is. It's like a three way split between being like a Syfy original movie, a serious movie about sharks, and even a teen slasher film. This strange combination does not seem to work.

I don't want there to be spoilers in this review so I won't go into any specifics, but I will say that it tries to be suspenseful and scary and while being super ludicrous. Interestingly, it actually doesn't begin like this though, and starts out with some credibility, leading you to believe that it might be a decent little shark flick after all. But then as soon as the first downright absurd scene comes, it just becomes more and more and more cartoonish (and predictable) by the minute. Piranha 3D has a good element of being self-aware that Shark Night 3D completely lacks.

But at least you can laugh at it. Producing a lot of unintentional laughs is what saves this movie from being a complete loser in my mind. Therefor it's not boring. I saw it in the theater with some people from my college ministry and we were all laughing a lot. The 3D effects were pretty good on a technical level and surprisingly the underwater photography is nothing short of excellent. As far as the acting goes, it's pretty poor like you'd expect. But with a movie like this you generally don't think much about the acting.

In conclusion, if you don't like cheesy B movies stay far far away from this movie. If you are a B movie fan, you might want to check this out but don't expect too much. I was expecting it to be a well done little film but it was instead a total joke that was at least funny at times.

P.S. If you do see this film, make sure to watch all the way to the end of the credits, you'll see why."

When the attacks begin secrets are revealed. I have to say that this movie is a big disappointment for me. For some reason I love all the cheesy sci-fy channel movies like ""Megashark vs. Giant Octopus"", pretty much movies that are so over the top cheesy and bad effects but are made that way are fun to watch and make fun of. I was hoping this would be more like ""Pirana"". A movie that is more comedy that anything and one you can watch and laugh at how bad it is. This one was none of those things. The problem with this one is that it tried to put in a plot and act like a real movie. When someone goes to see a movie called ""Shark Night"" you go in looking for shark attack scenes. There were a few memorable scenes but this one was more about getting revenge on someone from a few years before. If you are looking for a cheesy fun movie like ""Pirana"" this is not it. This is more serious. Overall, a disappointment for me because it wasn't cheesy enough. I give it a C.

Permalink",False,"Even the most eventful, exciting, and thrilling scenes in Shark Night 3D aren't done properly thanks to poorly executed CGI, pitiful acting, a lack of logic, and not to mention, the biggest problem of all, the film's rating. Ultimately this wants to do three things; bank off the 3D gimmick, be a Piranha-inspired film, and try and give cheesy, exploitation fun. The only thing it manages to pull off successfully is be a gimmick-sponsored, loathsome horror film.

The rating is the biggest problem. I can tell from certain scenes like when the characters are angry and when the shark attacks they wanted to show more. It was cut down most likely to get teens younger than eighteen to spend money and go alone. This will obviously increase ticket sales, and get more teens involved. It was a mistake for this to be a PG-13 horror film, when clearly, it could've been a very bloody, very thrilling piece of new-horror. Instead it wimps out, but will most likely earn an ""Unrated Director's Cut"" stamp on the DVD release.

The plot: A group of College kids go down to one of the girls' lakehouses where they encounter a group of hungry sharks. Of course by this lake there is no cell reception, and the person behind this wonderful place didn't decide to install a landline in case, you know, someone was hurt or injured. Not to mention, there is not one park patrol or janitor in this whole woods. Or people just randomly hiking. In order for this film to work, logic and common sense need to be excluded.

So, one person gets his arm bitten off, and is said by the oh-so bright medical student that he has only about two hours, but he manages to make it well through the night with enough energy to wrestle another shark in the water with one arm. The group also encounter unsettling rednecks who live on the lake and two wind up going on a boat with them no questions asked.

The remainder of the film is composed of lukewarm 3D effects, loud riffs, computer animated sharks, teen screams, and in-comprehendable PG-13 shark clips. All of which edited and executed in a ""we're-gonna-show-it-but-we're-not"" sort of form. One of the rednecks is portrayed somewhat effectively by Joshua Leonard, who you may know as the ski-cap sporting teenager in The Blair Witch Project. Now he plays a shark crazed maniac who wants to bank off of people's expense. The thought is sickening to say the least.

I will say the 3D is mixed. I was hoping since this is directed by David R. Ellis he would use the same 3D company used to make The Final Destination leap off the screen, but he didn't. Some scenes in 3D are actually effective, but unlike The Final Destination, they fail to actually leap off the screen.

The pluses in Shark Night 3D are just little perks that don't make the film worth seeing at all. Some decent music is played, Sara Paxton does what she can with what she has, and the underwater cinematography and first person view are the only things working in the film's favor. There is also a lovely music video after the credits with all the actors and actresses rapping aimlessly about how shark attacks and shark safety. Someone ought to remind them they shouldn't be with us now.

If you're looking for suspense, keep walking folks, Shark Night 3D is a big fan of just BOOM and it happens sort of action. Nothing is built up to seem even scarier, and there is not even the slightest indication when something is about to happen. I would rather be still, interested, and worried than just jump quickly only to roll my eyes at what I just did.

David R. Ellis directed Final Destination 2 with plenty of suspense, but neglected to shift it over to the fourth installment or this. He was also the man behind the camera on Snakes on a Plane. I can't tell if Shark Night 3D wants to be a satire on creatures like that film, or if it wants to be a serious take on the genre of the underwater beast. But its rating, its lack of logic, and its execution prevent it from achieving either status.

And also, no modern horror film is complete without a helpless animal treated like meat in one scene in the film. Shark Night 3D is no exception to the formula.

Starring: Sara Paxton, Dustin Milligan, and Joshua Leonard. Directed by: David R. Ellis."

Permalink",True,"We all know the saying, expectations only lead to disappointment. This is one of those movies.

The acting is dry. Dry as my knees, for example. And I didn't put no lotion on today. It had no story to it. There was no climax, it was just people dying. Which, I could have watched that on HBO. Don't waste your money.

The good thing is, the 3-D is amazing. I loved the 3-D. But I was ready to leave the horribleness from the start of the movie.

In conclusion, if you want to see great 3-D, and a sexy cast, watch this movie. If not, don't watch it. OR wait for it to come on HBO. It's that sad.

I DID NOT SEE THE 3D VERSION. Just getting that out of the way, I don't know how 'jaw-dropping' the effects are in 3D, but there were definitely some parts that stuff jumped out at you.

The movie is like Piranha but less hilarious. My mind state when I see a movie like this is ""I know it's going to suck, but hopefully I can enjoy watching them die."" And I did, to an extent.

My biggest problem with this movie is that they actually tried to make it more than what it is. You see it coming a mile away, and at least they had the decency to not make it a ""found footage"" film (you'll see what I mean if you watch it).

I've seen people on the message boards debating whether the PG-13 rating is a good or a bad thing, it's a bad thing. SHARK KNIGHT IS AN EXPLOITATION FILM that doesn't exploit. When the only redeeming quality and advertising point of this movie is people dying, it should be all blood and gore.

That being said, I did smile at some deaths. Laughed at how ridiculous some of the ""drama"" and dialogue was. I did appreciate the end, after the credits there is a music video with the cast that accepts and plays with just how bad the movie really is. As appalled as I was when the video came on, I couldn't help but laugh by the end of it.

So at least I left smiling."

This particular film starts off bad and gets no better.

You may well enjoy this film if you have had a lobotomy at some point.

If there is a tragedy in this film, it may well be the destruction of a speedboat,

Think Piranha, which was only held up by good acting and a good budget, and the few college kids off for a weekend at a lake, then throw into the mix, bad acting, a very weak plot, a storyline which desperately tried to find something more than a shark attack to make it even slightly entertaining, and you have shark night, possibly the biggest turd to have been excreted by Hollywood in recent years.

It is quite literally a couple of hours of your life you will never get back and will regret wasting.

What made Shark Night different, is the underwater 3D effect,water splashing, shark and dog swimming(BTW, the dog was the only character I worried about). After I googled it, it appears that this one was shot with real 3D camera. It's a shame that they put all this great equipment and technology to shoot such an old cliché. I won't recommend this movie to horror movie fans, but if you want to see some decent 3D clips, this one is the best of summer 2011, where so many fake-3D ended the 3D mania Avatar started.

Permalink",True,"**Spoiler Alert**

There I was, standing in front of RedBox trying to figure out what to rent with my ""free rental code"" and after the anxiety had slipped away I landed on Shark Night. Now I was very unsure how to accept or prepare for this movie after reading other reviews on this movie, And I will tell you this..... If you are looking for some just plain old movie fun then this is your movie. Shark Night was actually filmed quite well, had good acting, and there was a story involved too. Sure it was silly and dumb and some scenes did not really make sense, like how smart and amazingly aggressive the sharks were, but man this movie was fun!!!

Its about 7 college friends that go for a weekend of fun at a friends lake house for vacation. After some crazy in-water occurrences happen, they realize that there are a lot of different species of sharks in the water. I will not spoil the movie too much for you but after a dude gets his arm ripped off and people start to die then things start to take a twist.

Basically if you like to watch good cinematography, little bit of blood and gore, action, and scenes that don't really add up but are still entertaining to watch then I suggest this movie.

Well, it wasn't even half disappointing! It was gory! Unique! Like with all types of interesting shark species in a lake which is unusual! The twist at the end & how epic the death scenes were! Especially the scene where the sheriff gets burned with the petrol then falls into the water with the Tiger Sharks eating him alive! EPIC! Other scenes like the Hammer Head Shark killing, were epic & the Bull Shark Shark leaping out of the water & killing Gordon who was hanging onto the mangrove tree!

Those who are negative about this film are obviously hard to please & need help! What do you expect? Everything else has been pretty much done! Anyways I thought this was one of a kind! Saw this on opening day on the 30th of September! Amazing! 10/10

Permalink",False,"Final Destination 2 was an excellent horror film, whose combination of suspense, gore and narrative ingenuity made it hugely entertaining. Besides, the movie established director David R. Ellis as a filmmaker with big potential of standing out into the genre...same potential he later betrayed with the mediocre Snakes on a Plane and the horrible The Final Destination. Now, I think that Ellis' career has reached the bottom with Shark Night 3D, a genuinely pathetic ""horror"" film.

To start with, the lack of gore is one of the main reasons which make Shark Night 3D totally insipid. Unfortunately, the movie stays on the PG-13 field from the beginning to the end, with the shark attacks represented by agitated water and a little bit of red paint.

I do not think the special effects can become a bad movie into a good one, but they can at least make an experience a bit more tolerable to those of us who use to watch these kind of movies. And I would even excuse the lack of gore if Ellis' direction had generated enough suspense, or if we had really had interest in the characters' survival. But Shark Night 3D could not even achieve that. The deaths lack of any emotional impact, there is not any surprise in the attacks and the ""creative"" explanation of the lake sharks is so absurd that it works as an example of what NOT to do in a film about ""man vs. nature"".

It is honestly very difficult for me to find positive elements in this film. Submarine cinematography? Almost the whole movie is developed at night, so we barely see the sharks as silhouettes and threatening shadows. Humor? Totally unfunny. Performances? Don't make me laugh.

In conclusion, Shark Night 3D is a tedious, predictable and atrocious ""horror"" film in which I unfortunately wasted my time and my money. As for Ellis, I have officially lost any interest in his filmography, and I would not be surprised if we later see him directing cheap horror films for the straight-to-DVD market."

But on the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie - it's entertaining, fast-paced, and gleefully scary, even though it's held back by its tame PG-13 rating. The characters are surprisingly likable (for the most part, if you can ignore the perpetually unlikable Joel David Moore), and while the story makes no damn sense, it doesn't matter. This is all about the shark attacks and how over-the-top they can get, and director David R. Ellis completely delivers on that front. So grab a few beers and some smart-mouthed friends, and you're guaranteed to have a good time with this one. This is everything you wanted ""Sharknado"" to be.

They also have somehow made an abundant amount of species man killers in a lake, where deep water, cold water, and warm water species all coexist. It makes no sense, nor does any of the sharks' behavior. I just hope that movies start to make movies based on truth and scientific knowledge, rather than giving sharks human qualities and selectively insatiable appetites.

Permalink",True,"This one could have been a good deal of schlocky fun, but alas the filmmakers decided to take the inane premise of a handful of vacationing young folks being terrorized by sharks in a Louisiana lake resort community seriously instead of treating it in a more tongue-in-cheek manner. Director David B. Ellis maintains a snappy enough pace and offers lots of flashy stylistic flourishes throughout, but crucially fails to generate any essential tension. Worse yet, the heavy-handed script by Will Hayes and Jesse Studenberg not only relates a silly story that becomes more increasingly ludicrous as it unfolds, but also gets bogged down in tiresome melodrama and presents an array of cardboard characters who are impossible for the viewer to care about. The fact that the CGI sharks look hopelessly cartoonish and unconvincing adds further abject insult to already appalling injury. The blaring rock soundtrack proves to be headache-inducing while the PG-13 rating puts the kibosh on any explicit nudity or graphic gore. On the plus side, Donal Logue manages to rise above the muck with his amusing portrayal of a good ol' boy sheriff and the attractive female cast members look pretty smokin' in their bikinis. But overall this clunker sizes up as the cinematic equivalent of a gallon of rotten chum.

Permalink",True,"Very bad movie, many lacking out which nerves you out. The girl takes the pistol and on a dumb way the guy get it back, it's a scene that shouldn't be in a movie and many like that one. Like when the guy got his arm eaten off, they didn't want him take to the hospital but next day they did so it does not make sense. Characters are mediocre, there are noting so special to get you into the movie. Also to mention, the name of he movie is the shark night so as you would thing, they will be eaten one by one while swimming, wrong. No one is eaten that way, woman felt off, another characters were killed. So non-innovative for a teenage slasher horror movie. Effects are above the average but stupid scenes destroy the movie. Because of the effects and some parts which are good in a plot I rate is as a sufficient movie to watch but that's bellow the good. If you like sharks, 3D and you want to entertain kids, this is a good intro for them as a horror but for the grown ups, bypass the movie

This little gem may have slipped by getting added to our library's DVD section if I hadn't pulled it off the donation cart. How someone could give up this gem, I'm not sure, but I'm glad they did because I, and numerous library patrons, will now be able to enjoy it.

Nerds, Jocks and Hot Girls all get along together, which is nice to see. Then you have the typical redneck, which of course you will find on the way to your giant lake house that has no neighbors close by. Once we get to the house, that's when the mangling and dismembering begins. What they think of as a freak thing, (the shark must have came through the levy after hurricane season), quickly turns into sharks everywhere.

The sheriff (who plays Harvey on Gotham love that crazy show), adds some comic relief as the bumbling country bumpkin. Very little nudity, and no sex, just lots and lots of blood. The final reason as to why this is happening makes sense in a twisted way. And honestly I'm surprised something like this hasn't happened in real life or maybe it has. So next time you're near a saltwater lake, you might want to let your friends go for a swim while you stay on the beach.

Permalink",True,"Shark Night 3D (2011): Dir: David R. Ellis / Cast: Sara Paxton, Dustin Milligan, Chris Carmack, Joshua Leonard, Katharine McPhee: This is quite possibly the worst film of 2011. It is certainly the opposite of Jaws, which stands as the best of shark suspense films. Here we have a bunch of airhead college kids speed boating out to the latest big party only to have sharks attack from everywhere. David R. Ellis has made terrible films before so why should he stop now? Check out Homeward Bound 2, Cellular or the notorious Snakes on a Plane and prepared to be surprised when this washed up junk is far worse than any of those titles are. We are given lame ass water skiing where the shark follows close behind, as indicated by the camera. Then the skier does a few flips that land him on his skies. The problem is that the camera is immediately tailing the skier even though it should be indicated that it might take a moment for the shark to do so. We have two nasty rednecks who apparently have nasty plans for the students that regard their new found bond with the sharks. One by one these idiots are attacked and devoured by sharks including scenes where these fish spring to great heights from the water to gobble up victims on speed boats. This is all pretty pathetic and the sharks couldn't look any less convincing than if they were portrayed by bath toys. They seem to zigzag through the water immediately at the slightest drip of blood. My suggestion would be to feed every copy of this wretched film to sharks. This film is so bad that the sharks would likely puke it up. Score: 0 / 10

Permalink",True,"Okay the title was off-putting. The movie is equally good and bad. It has some flaws but all movies do. So if you are looking for guts and half-eaten body parts then this is not your movie. However if you want a movie of the ""teenagers go to the countryside and get harassed by the locals"" genre well this is kind of it plus sharks.

Its like a PG-13 mix of 'Saw' and 'Jaws' which may seem pointless but at least there is Shark diversity. 'Tiger','Hammerhead'...etc. A teaching opportunity on sharks. It has a good start and the story slowly builds up until we meet the locals. It stereotypes all country folks as creeps and pervs. An unnecessary chase with a police boat.the sheriff is a friend of Sara but you can see right through that. Something is off about Sara. Then a shark attacks the black dude first which is kind a racist and cliché but okay. This is where you lose interest but it does pick up again i gotta admit.

Flaw 1: If Sara had a bad experience the last time why come back? Flaw 2: Sara's reaction to seeing Dennis again considering their previous encounter was not right but it was made so only to surprise you later but his creepy sidekick gave it away anyway. It was badly done or Sara is a stupid psycho who asked for it. and finally except the perv store clerk everyone they met was in on the feeding people to sharks gig.

In spite of all that I am still left with some satisfaction in the end.

Permalink",False,"First of all - 25 mil $ to make this? Whow! Where did the money go? Did a shark eat it? Anyways, this movie feels like an 'exploitation' movie, and if viewed as such, delivers perfectly. We can easily see that this was the idea by the speed-up effects during the necessary but uninteresting setting of a few teens having some fun at the lake. Likewise, the special effects were intentionally crappy - but with good delivery, keeping the creepy effects of, say, the tiger shark's teeth. It also numbs a 'horror' feel of blood and gore, which would hurt this movie. We actually do get some substance and story here, much more than other sharkploitation films like 'Jersey Shore Shark Attack' - whereas here, there are 'bad guys', unlike 'Jaws', with a hidden plot and agenda, and there are a few twists.

A movie that fits above average in the genre of two headed shark, sharktopus and sharknado. If you like those, watch this and enjoy it. If not, steer clear. Personally, and to my surprise, I was entertained.

Directed by: David R. Ellis

Storyline: We then cut to a high school or college or university or what ever it is, where it seems to be results day. We also get a product placement of the Halo franchise here as well. We see a confrontation scene which turns out to be a comical ploy to make the plot develop. Once they get the boat and have been driving for a while. We also get an unwinding montage of them just dancing or comparing clothes, not sure if this is what normal people would do, but I'll let it pass for being a nice montage, it also reminds us of the other side of the 15 rating by showing 'side boob'. Nick then takes Malik boat surfing, and they get out into the deeper swamp and this is when we see a fin protruding from the water and Malik gets knocked off his board by the shark. Once Nick finds the arm and escapes the shark, they then make their way to the nearest hospital on the boat but the blood dripping from his arm is leaking into the water and leaving a trail for the sharks to follow. But the sharks hit the boat and knocks Maya out of the boat and into the water where she gets eaten. A shark also takes out the boat's steering some how and this causes them to crash and blow up the boat. Which is honestly a good explosion and looks realistic and not CGI. That is how explosions should look. This is when the rednecks show up, Gordon and Beth go with the rednecks to go and get help but it turns out the rednecks were just leading them into a trap. Back at the house Malik takes a spear and tries to find the shark that took his arm, surprisingly he finds the correct one and kills it. Back on the redneck boat they push Gordon into the watch but he is able to climb a tree to only get eaten. Back at the house they find a camera on the shark Malik killed and they work out that people have released sharks into the water to kill people. Blake takes Malik on the jetski to try and get him to a hospital before he dies but they both end up dying. The rednecks kill Beth by feeding her to Cookie Cutter sharks, this is one thing I have to give them props for, because they took a very uncommon barely known shark and gave it screen time, the CGI for the Cookie Cutters is some of the best in the movie as they are the most correctly portrayed visuals of Cookie Cutters. We also find out that the police sheriff Sabin, is also working with the rednecks, it isn't an unexpected plot twist but it is nicely played. Sabin is back at the house with Nick while Sara and the rednecks are on the boat planning to feed Sara to the sharks before she drowns in the cage. You see Nick spill gasoline while Sabin is dunking him in the water, but some how Nick is able to get a lighter out of no where while he's tied to a chair and throw it at the gasoline trail, setting Sabin on fire so he falls into the shark water. But you see the wig of the stunt double fall off when he falls into the water. But we all know how this ends, good guy Nick survives and saves the girl and the redneck gets what he deserves.

Acting: The first scene in the student dorm is good with Malik played by Sinqua Walls pretending to be serious, but this is ruined by Nick played by Dustin Milligan reacting too quickly to Malik's joke. But for everyone else during the movie, they are all believable and decent actors who can portray emotion when they need to and look believable when they need to.

Noticeable Camera work: At the start we see underwater shots, but you'll also see that the cameraman is constantly moving the camera. As an underwater videographer that really annoying me as they could have a great shot if only they knew how to hold a camera steady in the water. Our first piece of fun camera work is a speeded up montage like trip to Sara's beach house which takes them a day to get to by car. There is also an across the water shot which appeared to have been done by the camera crew on a boat or barge. Good POV shot from the police boat as they start off the boat chase followed by birds eye shots from before and during the chase.

Graphics: We finally see the shark a third into the movie and the CGI for the shark isn't the best there is. The shark looks like it is actually in the water, so they have got that part correctly, but the shark itself looks fake, but credit where it is due as they were able to make the background of it look real to immerse it into the water.

Overall Feel: This is a B-rated movie, this means that it isn't as good as your other general cinema released movie. But you can watch this movie and enjoy it as you can tell that the people who made the movie, put their all in making this movie. They also did good for a budget of $25,000,000 as they were able to get good sets, good actors and decent CGI. So if you enjoy movies where good guy beats bad guy but with added sharks, then you'll enjoy this film. I feel it is underrated because of its 4 stars, it should at least have 6 in my opinion.

Permalink",False,"After watching Shark Night, I was totally disgusted - NO character development, NO story, NO deep and meaningful inner message designed to enrich the soul and really make you think.

Only kidding.

If you haven't already figured it out, Shark Night is about sharks - sharks that eat people. And, if that's all you're looking for, you shouldn't feel too short-changed.

Shark Night starts off with a couple of carefree, randy American teenagers, frolicking around in a salt water lake - guess what happens to them? Anyway, cut to the local collage where a group of seven insanely good-looking teens, all armed with quick wits and iphones, go to the same salt water lake to chill out.

Then, when bikini meets shark teeth, there can only be one winner. Okay, so the sharks are all (surprise surprise) water-based, but don't worry, our human heroes find every excuse possible to end up in the water.

So, there you have it. If you like your B-movies bloodthirsty and don't take things too seriously, you'll enjoy this (think Piranha 3D or Cabin Fever). Some other reviews have said the special effects looked cheap and there wasn't enough of the sharks. I found the FX okay and the sharks were hardly given any real dialogue to learn, so give them a break, okay?

Permalink",True,"It seems that many folks have forgotten how to just enjoy a movie. This movie is supposed to be just here to be fun and not to be taken seriously. Sadly, I'm didn't enjoy it. This movie directed by late fame stunt man, David R. Ellis is just awful. Shark Night or advertised as Shark Night 3D is was his final film before his death. The film follows a group of blend college friends who has the most unrealistic beach bodies ever for college students. Most of the men have killer abs, while the girls go with tight bikinis even if they didn't have to. How on earth, did they get all that time to work out, with all that studying? Since, the movie is PG-13 and can't show nudity. All of the students go around the movie, half naked with their bathing suits even if they are not swimming. The group made out of Sara (Sara Paxton), Nick (Dustin Milligan), Maya (Alyssa Diaz), Blake (Chris Zylka), Gordon (Joel David Moore), Beth (Katherine McPhee) and Malik (Sinqua Walls) are at Sara's holiday home at a lake to party because one of them got a B plus on a grade. Can, we have one horror movie with college students not partying and really looks like smart people? These 'supposedly' college students are some of the crudest, over-sexed, idiots around. Soon they encounter Sara's ex Dennis (Chris Carmack) and his friends who acts like total dumb rednecks by being racist to the token black guy, Malik. Some people might be offended by how Malik is portray in this film. Some people might be offended with the portrayal of the rednecks as a negative stereotype. With names like Red (Joshua Leonard), it's clear that they're supposed to be country bumpkins. Anyways, the students soon find out that the town people are attracting sharks to the lake so they can sell the footage of the shark attacks for money. It's pretty senseless when you think about it. It cost more to produce the video, then to sale it. When I see nature documentaries, they took months to put together a specialist crew and high tech boat just to put a camera on an animal like that. The three rednecks alone put cameras in all those sharks, move them to a lake and made a lot of college kids disappear, just for a few dollars. I call BS with that. If people wanted to see it so badly, it's on the internet for free; why would somebody pay that much to see sharks attacking people? It doesn't make any sense. Talking about watching a Shark attack film. Why did some people did go to the theater to see this film? The story is pretty childish, predictable and campy. This movie is no 'Jaws'. (1975) It doesn't have any depth to the characters, and things about the plot doesn't add up. It's pretty laughable over the top, to see a man with one arm walk around seeking revenge for the shark for taking his arm, a few hours earlier! In real life, that man would be dead, due to the blood lose, or badly alive. Plus, how on earth is there no cell phone connection on this island or land-line connection? How cliché in a horror movie. The 3D is pretty annoying as it's too poking. The sharks had very poor CGI effects. The jumping thing isn't impossible, I understand watching nature videos, but it is something rare a shark would do. Plus, a shark wouldn't dare leap to take someone off a jet ski. Awesome shot, but impossible for a shark to do. I just wish they made it more real as a person who has loved sharks since he could walk, this movie makes all sharks seem like man-eating killers. In my opinion it's sad that films about killer sharks can't tell the different between near-harmless sharks to vicious meat eaters. Sand Tiger Sharks are not really that aggressive, genius. Plus, they have no clue what to do with a Cookie Cutter Shark. There are 350 different species of shark and only 6 of them eat people. And those 6 species usually don't attack people in the open water, unless they mistake a person for something they are not. Jaws makes sense because the shark could have mistaken the people as seals with the shots. In here, a shark will never go after a moving jet ski due to the noise and speed. This movie did not have good acting in it. Why was American Idol contestant Katharine McPhee even in this film? Hard to talk her serious as a singer, when she show her side boob in a cheesy shark attack movie. A lot of critics complain that there is no nudity. In my opinion, it doesn't need any nudity. Women shouldn't have to be on full display for stupid audience's amusement. It's a shark movie, not the playboy channel. The movie could stop with all the sexual overtones camera shots like side boobs, as zooming on some girl's butt. Sex sales, but it didn't work here. The editing is bad. Blown up scene of a boat exploding on a dock, is follow by jet-ski on the dock. Sorry, the jet-ski and the dock was blown up in the previous scene. That music video after the credits was annoying. The movie loaded from beginning to end with grating pop/R&B songs. Some of them work, some didn't. This movie obviously wasn't made to be taken seriously. It was made to showcase the lousy 3-D effects, bikini clad women, stupid PG-13 gore, and hunk men. In my opinion, it's market for dumbest of the pre-teens audience. Still, it's watchable if you like B-horror films. It should have been sent to DVD then the theaters. Maybe you won't want to own it, but if check out. Watch it with your own risk.

Permalink",True,"One would almost forgive 'Shark Night 3D' for just being a Bmovie w/ a budget creature featureand it would've been just that pending they didn't add what they thought to be a ""smart plot"" half-way through. And I'm a sucker for Bmovie creature features, i.e. 'Piranha 3D,' but this one attempted to one-up and instead sunk depths. It's laugh-out-loud devilish plan to get skinny college idiots on holiday back into the waters once it's discovered a lake contains multiples of sharks is just plain stupid. At least, 'Piranha 3D' took the victims by surprise and that made it at least remotely realistic. Mercifully, it's incredibly short, but still should be avoided by all. 1½/5 Stars.

Permalink",True,"This movie is basically a Jaws and Friday the 13th mash-up. The actors were amateurs, the plot was stale, and it had terrible CGI effects (seriously, the sharks look totally fake). My dog could create a better film than this trash. Speaking of dogs, the only scene that genuinely scared me (or surprised me would be a better term) was when one of the bad guys threw the dog off the boat; that's why I gave this movie a 3/10. The ending was so predictable; I knew the shark was going to jump out of the water. Unlike most of todays cliché horror films, this movie didn't have much nudity in it (that doesn't mean there isn't any nudity at all, though).

Anyways, you can watch the movie yourself and see what you think. I'm just one person with my own opinion. I think this movie is trash, but if you can stomach trash, then you can handle this film.

Permalink",False,"For a PG-13 horror movie that is not overly gory, or full of nudity and profanity, Shark Night delivers better than expected. I don't have kids so I'm not generally concerned with it, but I gather that ""PG-13 Horror"" is a very tough market - both to find a good movie, and even harder to make a good movie. However, I didn't even know this movie was PG-13 until I read some comments on it - AFTER I'd seen it. And both my girlfriend and I enjoyed it WHILE we were watching it.

As with most movies in this category, the story is predictable, with foreseeable but fun twists along the way. The CGI is also not what I'd expect from a $25 million dollar price tag, but it doesn't detract from the movie too much if your goal is just to enjoy the ride.

You don't watch Shark Night 3D expecting to see Jaws, just like you don't watch Final Destination 2 (one of the director's earlier films) expecting to see The Shining. It's called ""Shark Night 3D"". If you want brilliant, highbrow suspense, go see something else. If you want ""Shark Night 3D"", watch this."

Permalink",False,"This film is absolutely terrible. There is not one redeeming feature. This is a film that isn't even 'so bad it's funny,' this is just plain awful. The writing is poor, the acting somehow worse, but the worst aspect of the film, and perhaps the most disappointing, were the effects. When seeing a film of this sort, you would expect the effects on the creatures to be at least passable. They weren't. They were literally PS2-era quality special effects. This was a total waste of about an hour and a half of my life. Perhaps had I seen the film in 3D I may have been able to add another point to my final score, but unfortunately I had to endure this in 2D. Endure being the preferred word. I endured this film.

Permalink",False,"Shark Night can be summed up without really watching the movie. The title says shark and the cover has it in killing position. The only real question of a theme movie like this would be: is it so good that it becomes a cult classic VS. is it so poor that not even shark fans should watch. The bottom line, it fits right in the middle.

There aren't too many good parts in this movie, but not many bad. It carries along and builds the setup and eventually gets thru its horror. The actress have a lot of visual appeal and the production value is top notch. The 3D in the title pushes that it is a polished movie. The acting is marginal, with a great cameo by Donal Logue.

The horror scenes aren't overly graphic and don't show too much. It wins as a horror by just having the shark fin cutting thru the water after the victims, but it loses from a shark standpoint because it really doesn't show much.

I would recommend this movie to fans of both horror movies and sharks."

Permalink",True,"Okay, i'm sure it comes as not surprise for me to say that Shark Night is ridiculous. And you know what? I saw that coming. And sometimes a movie can be so bad it's good, such as 2010's Piranha. But to say that Shark Night is enjoyable is never going to happen.

Shark Night, like every movie about sharks that comes on SyFy, revolves around a group of college friends who go to a lake for spring break, only to e visited by, you know who, sharks. But not just sharks: Sharks that can jump out of water.

Shark Night may not have been one of those really bad Syfy movies that escaped their clutches, but it definitely is, proof or not. How could anyone let this ridiculous garbage go to theaters? Piranah worked. Why? Even though both films share some of the same traits, Piranha was intentionally hilarious, cringingly gross, while being funny, and a total blast. And the consistent nudity helped also.

Shark Night has no form of sex, no form of really over the top bloody blood, it's just empty. It's a really bad movie that just takes its ridiculousness to amazing levels. Shark Night is a joke, basically. And the joke is on them.

Permalink",True,"I saw the trailer and clips for this film, and it was obviously another rerun or modern revamp of classic shark film Jaws, films like Deep Blue Sea and Open Water do alright trying this idea, and then came this one with 3D being the big draw, from director David R. Ellis (Final Destination 2, Cellular, Snakes on a Plane, The Final Destination). Basically seven college friends, Sara Palski (Aquamarine's Sara Paxton), Nick LaDuca (Dustin Milligan), Beth (Katharine McPhee), Malik (Sinqua Walls), Maya (Alyssa Diaz), Blake (Chris Zylka) and Gordon (Joel David Moore), are heading for a lake house for a weekend vacation with fun in the sun. Everything seems to be going smoothly, as they enjoy swimming in the pool and water skiing, but then all of the sudden Malik is taken into the water, and they are all shocked to see his arm has been bitten off. At first they are sure it is a freak accident with the power boat, but soon enough they spot in the lake shark swimming and hungry for flesh, so they must avoid the water. The nearest help they can get is a few hours away, so they get started travelling, but of course a shark is not too far behind them and claims a victim or two, there is more than one shark in the lake water. With no phone signal and their transport being damaged by the attacks there seems to be nowhere to go, but then Sara's old boyfriend Dennis Crim (Chris Carmack) and his friend Red (Joshua Leonard) show up on their boat, supposedly to help them. Of course they show their true intentions, they are the ones that released the shark that took Malik's arm off, in fact they have released fifteen species of shark in the lake, all with cameras on them to capture their horrific attacks on film. They have been inspired by the Discovery Channel's Shark Week and Faces of Death to film people being eaten by sharks to make a lot of money on a website, and worse comes when Sheriff Sabin (Donal Logue) is in cahoots with them as well. In the end of course the crazy villains get what they deserve, and the noticeable sharks in the lake are defeated, leaving Sara and Nick, along with their dog, as the last survivors, of course there is a leap out of the water by another shark. Also starring Damon Lipari as Keith. Being a B-movie the acting is obviously a bit cheesy and the scripting a little silly at times, the shark attacks helped out by the special effects and of course the 3D with things popping out at you are what keep you watching. I think that the critics were a little bit harsh to give this film one star out of five, it is not the worst film ever, I agree it not original, but you can't help but be intrigued a little by the villain plan, and of course the bloody gore is worth viewing, so for me it is an alright horror. Okay!

Each shark has it's own camera and they have a live feed of the kills. Now -- not only is it a dumb idea, but also unbelievable: how could they get all of the sharks into the lake? How could they capture a big great white and haul it across the world to put into the lake? How could they even get the big sharks on their little tiny boat? Not only was the screenplay bad, but when one shark jumped out of the water to swallow a character (who was on a jetski) whole was the end of any credibility.

Permalink",False,"I admit I never expected this creature feature to be a masterpiece; it's really just popcorn entertainment. This is for people who plan on leaving the real, critical world and just enjoy a nice, wild, bloody flick...with sharks. For me, I found it surprising that this flick made it to theaters so there has to be some value to the movie and, to some degree, there is.

Interestingly, the plot is rather creative: college teens go to one of their homes in a salt water lake, unknown to them that several different species of sharks are put there by some locals with sick intentions. We have some typical teen stereotypes, some of which are at least interesting while others not so much. A few of the characters are either stupid or just plain creepy (suitable for a movie like this).

What I like here is that the filmmakers use different kinds of sharks besides the usual great white. Species include hammerhead, bull, and even cookie cutter (which was a real surprise). I'm glad that they were getting creative with the use of differing creatures. The sharks are pretty scary and there are some moments that will shock you.

Unlike ""Piranha 3D"", Shark Night actually has a good enough plot, some amount of character development, decent back story, and some good creature moments. I guess this movie literally has a bigger bite than ""Piranha 3D."" While far from great, Shark Night is at least an entertaining flick, worth the watch once or twice. Wanna see some good old killer shark fun? Then check this action out. Just make sure you're not bleeding when you enter the water."

Permalink",False,"A weekend at a lake house turns into a nightmare for seven stereotype young vacationers as they are subjected to shark attacks, but its not only the sharks they need to worry about.

There's some good effects and action set ups but Shark Night is poorly scripted, with an equally poor storyline that compared to Scooby-Doo makes it look like The Usual Suspects. It is certainly is a no brainer but if you want to see girls in bikini's there's more suitable places to get your fix or if you must even watch Piranha (2010). The actors try their best with the dialogue, notable is Sara Paxton. There's really not much more to say about this clunker.

While better in the production department compared to DTV films the whole film sinks of yesterdays fish which is odd considering its is the same director of entertaining The Final Destination (2009) and Cellular (2004) to name a few. It's a shame as everyone loves a good shark film but this just isn't one.

Maybe if I would have gone into it thinking B-Rated teenie bopper slasher it might have help some credit. The effects are weak, character development is weak, even the explanation how sharks are in a lake (simply someone said 'It's a salt water lake') The whole story just flies with nothing to hold it up.

Permalink",True,"So if you came to this movie with the hopes that you may have found an actually good shark film that sits behind the 1975 hit ""Jaws""...then you have come to the wrong place. Shark Night 3D should be placed hand in hand with Pirhana 3D when it comes to film judging. It is quite frankly a ""Just for fun"" kind of film that doesn't need to be criticized for all the typical things movies in this genre are.

Shark Night 3D is a movie that is enjoyable to watch if you can take it with a grain of salt. The film is more of a Teen slasher film which includes all the bells and whistles that come along with them. You know that young unknown cast in their normal movie fashion that makes no sense(Jock,EasyGirl,Smart/GoodGirl,Geek and Geeks friend). *Spoiler Alert* A Killer (Sharks + People). Bad decision making skills...ETC. You get the picture.

Scares are a rarity in this film almost every time someone is about to die you will know about it and see it coming from a mile away...trust me on this one. But there are a few curve balls in there as well so don't worry. *Spoiler Alert* A lot of the Sharks and Shark Sequences in this film are CGI which is something that a lot of people disagree with. I mean your not gonna see many ""Bruces"" out there attacking helpless college kids but there are a few. Overall the film uses some good effects that work well and some CGI that are so so but the effects are better then most recent shark films.

Acting is average for this type of movie but who really cares ITS A HORROR MOVIE! Mind you its not horrible but not good either. Character development is sparse even for the characters the script wants us to root for so when people are killed your like ""eh whatever"".

The Plot is above average compared to many shark films that have surfaced over the last decade or so. It has its cool points which are believable and not out stretched.

Overall it wasn't a bad film. I would recommend anyone who enjoys films for their entertainment and fun to take a look its worth a shot.

Permalink",False,"Holy s%&t this movie is bad! Terrible screenplay, horrid. Whoever wrote this movie should never be allowed to write another screenplay ever again. It has some of the worst characterizations I've ever seen, acting out in some seriously implausible ways. Who the hell knows if these people can actually act? It's possible that they can (Sara Paxton definitely can), but you wouldn't know from watching this. This is the worst kind of melodramatic fluff, accompanied by the absolute worst dialog I believe I've ever encountered in a film .... oh, and then you get your occasional poorly executed shark attack. That's not an exaggeration. These attacks are not scary or disturbing in the slightest and the sharks look very fake. This movie is baaaaaaaad, bad bad bad bad. Damn man. I know there is a good post-JAWS shark attack movie just waiting to be made. Actually, The Reef qualifies as one. But I'm talking CGI sharks that look terrifying and real and that eviscerate people in a way that is disturbing to the psyche. This movie doesn't even deserve to smell Bela Lugosi's sh#t.

Permalink",True,"What there is of a plot goes like this.

The guy who did 'Snakes on a plane' decides to make 'Sharks in a saltwater lake'. Realising the title isn't as catchy, he changes it to Shark Night, which actually happens in the final third. The majority of the movie is in the day.

Group of friends go to the lake looking buff and beautiful, apart from the one who is in Avatar. The lake is infested by two or three sharks, and they start taking out the kids one by one.

One on particular has his arm bit off, and decides to fight the shark in one instance, and in the next instance, just gives up and lets the shark have him.

All this could have something to do with the annoying ginger one from Blade, but this film does prove that the Blair Witch project was not real, and Josh just went home for eleven years, waiting patiently for a shark themed 3D movie script to land on his door mat.

To be honest, this is pretty turgid stuff. The acting is mediocre and it really doesn't have anything about it.

Coming from Elis, I was expecting something a little cheesy like 'Deep Blue Sea', but he seems to have taken the charm from his movies.

It's watchable stuff though, for all the wrong reasons, but you know a film is bad, when a shark jumps out of the water and grabs a guy clean off a jet ski....in the dark.

At least t didn't have 'fin' at the end of the movie. we just had some god-awful music video.

Without today's imaginations and technology how did this movie pass the script stage. Not only is the script horrible, the acting is painful to watch; the events are so unrealistic and so poorly thought of and executed that this should be rated as an F movie if there is such a rating. Piranha 3D was over the top; it was tongue in cheek movie; it was fun, gory and entertaining - Shark Night 3D doesn't come close to anything. It felt like this movie never took off and was stuck in the beginning credits until the end credits. I won't recommend this movie to anyone.

Permalink",False,"Hey a shark movie. Its been awhile since the ""man-eating"" beast has had a theatrical release. Of course there are many films on sharks, and in my mind only very few have actually been enjoyable (Jaws, Jaws 2, and if there has to be a third I would go with Deep Blue Sea).

This movie just isn't trying at all. Its the same cliché as all horror-survival movies are now-a-days; a bunch of high school/college students in - a - over - their - heads - but - some - how - manage - to - overcome - the - impossible - with - the - retarded - plot - twist - that - doesn't - make - sense - at - all(Yep that's all in one breathe). Flat out its annoying with little to no character development, and cheesy death scenes. To be honest the death scenes are a joke; very little to no gore what so ever, and we all know that's what makes this type of movie. See I can and will over look the ""realism"" effect if the movie is enjoyable, and I do because in the end that's what it is, a movie, but this movie just keeps at it. Sharks don't leap out of the water, sharks are not rouge they don't go off and hunt people down, and sharks don't feast on humans. This movie has all of those shark clichés.

If your looking for a shark movie to watch this isn't the one. Jaws, Jaws 2, Deep Blue Sea, The Reef, or even Open Water are all better options. There will never be another Jaws...the movie that actually scared millions from going back into the water.

Basically this movie is trying to cash in on the recently released Piranha 3D from last year. They both have similar concepts and story lines, but in the end its all about the deaths. If this movie had some actual gore, and a not so over the top plot twist then maybe, just maybe I could over look the terribleness of this film."

The only disappointment about this movie though is i wish it could have been longer. I feel as if the movie was overly rushed, everyone ended up dying one after another, it could have showed them hanging out more at the lake house before they found the sharks in the water. And i also wish it showed Sara Paxton & Dustin Milligan dating towards the end and getting all of the sharks out of the lake.

The only thing descent about this movies is that they did an alright with using and including 3D

I do not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you still go make sure to watch all the credits there is a bonus at the end.

What i liked most about it is it is directed by the same guy who directed the final destination. This film surprisingly has fairly decent acting; a good storyline and some pretty good jump scenes.

Permalink",False,"Let me start this review with an honest observation. Creature features, while fun, are rarely scary. A big lumbering shark in the water or a snake in the grass is scary in reality but always falls flat for me on the big screen. While I do agree with the general consensus that ""Jaws"" is the rare creature feature that works, I have to say that the rest have done little thrill me. It is with this honest trepidation that I went to see ""Shark Night 3D"". ""Shark Night 3D"" is the latest creature feature to use both creatures in the water and 3D to lumbering effect. Neither is new or revolutionary. Sorry to say it but ""Jaws 3D"" beat you to the punch about thirty years ago.

Anyway, on to ""Shark Night 3D"" and what a treat this movie is. Set in Louisiana, seven Tulane undergraduates – Sara (Sarah Paxton), Nick (Dustin Milligan), Beth (Katharine McPhee), Malik (Sinqua Walls), Maya (Alyssa Diaz), Blake (Chris Zylka) and Gordon (Joel David Moore) – drive to Sara's family vacation home on a secluded private lake near Lake Pontchartrain. At a local bait shop, Sara encounters her old boyfriend, Dennis (Chris Carmack) and his friend, Red (Joshua Leonard). Dennis and Red make racial taunts to Malik and Maya, his Latina fiancée, but Sara diffuses the situation. Sara drives a speedboat recklessly to the vacation home, attracting the attention of Sheriff Sabin (Donal Logue). He chases her, frightening her friends, but then happily shares a beer with them. He tells Sara he is happy to see her back after a three-year- long absence.

While Gordon tries to seduce Beth and Sara sunbathes, Nick, Blake, Malik and Maya go waterskiing. A shark pursues Malik and attacks him. Nick, Blake and Maya try to rescue him, but he swims back to shore – missing his right arm. When Nick swims out into the lake to retrieve his arm, he is stalked and pursued by the shark. Nick barely makes it back to shore. A medical student, he stabilizes Malik, then goes with Sara and Maya to take him to a hospital. However, blood dripping from Malik's wound attracts a shark that attacks the boat. Maya is knocked into the water and eaten. The shark then damages the steering column of the boat. It crashes into the gas pump in front of the boathouse, exploding and stranding everyone. Sara, Nick and Malik barely make it to shore. Because their cell phones have no reception and the house has no landline, they cannot call for help. Blah, blah, blah.

""Shark Night 3D"" is everything that a horror movie shouldn't be. It's PG-13, it's loaded from beginning to end with grating pop/R&B songs, its 3D looks like crap, and the characters are so cookie cutter boring that you won't care who lives or who dies. I would say that you want them all to be shark bait but once you've seen one awful shark attack in this film, you'll feel like you've seen them all. Add to this a ridiculous third act twist that makes little sense (seriously, watch the movie and tell me how it is even POSSIBLE for the redneck hillbillies to do what they did) and some of the most implausible events I've ever seen in a movie and you've got one of the worst movies of the year.

Though, truth be told, it is comforting to know that if someone loses an arm in a giant lake, you can easily find it in dirty water by swimming out from your lake without a mask or goggles. After this, while locating said lost arm, you can also spot a bloodthirsty shark. When you see said shark, you can out swim it even though it can overtake a speeding boat with someone skiing behind. Did that just make your brain hurt? Ugh. Join the club. Last year's ""Piranha 3D"" was dumb, harmless fun. This movie doesn't deserve a theatrical run, hell it doesn't even deserve to be played on Syfy."

So, do yourself a favor, folks. Don't waste your money going to see this, or even renting it on DVD, three months from now. Just wait until Syfy Channel telecasts during next year's Discovery Channel Shark Week. At least, then, you can preserve your sanity by changing channels!

Film-wise the story is great, sure it's the typical ""lets spend the summer out in a remote location where nothing can go wrong"" type of flick..but the plot is gruesomely entertaining. Just the sheer darkness of the characters paints a grim image of things to come.

Great casting of believable actors with enough room for character development, loved the script in terms of its openness. Even though the sharks were all CGI, it looks mental in 1080p.

To summarise, viewers searching for an adrenaline boost and a buddy movie..this should get the brain stimulated for the next hour and a half."

Permalink",False,"As a lot of other reviewers have said, I too was really looking forward to seeing this movie. The trailer did what it was supposed to do...bring people into the theaters to see shark attacks. Unfortunately, as usual, the trailer has most of the films good moments included and there's not much left to see that's original in the actual film.

I liked the concept of the movie, and the reason that the sharks ended up in a lake could have made for a great film, but the studio's decision to make this PG-13 killed it. Without an R rating all of the stuff that teens and horror fans actually like about this type of movie is missing. There's no real gore, no people being torn up by the sharks (at least not on screen), and no nudity. If you're 13 you may actually like this movie, and your parents will probably sweat a lot thinking they're sending you to see something a lot worst than what it is, but they have nothing to worry about.

The acting in this was OK, but nothing Oscar worthy. You don't really get to know anything about most of the cast and, to me, the one thing you do find out about the female lead came too late. Personally, I didn't recognize anyone in this movie, with the exception of Joel David Moore, and after his run on the TV show Bones, and his part in the movie Avatar, I expected better of him.

If an unrated DVD version comes out I'll probably watch it again, just to see if anything actually worth seeing was filmed. But I highly doubt it."

Permalink",False,"Judging from the movie's poster, which features a terrified young woman in a bikini being pursued by a massive shark, I'm guessing that Shark Night 3D was rushed into production to cash in on the success of the recent Piranha movies, which proved surprisingly entertaining thanks to an excess of nudity and gore. However, it soon becomes apparent that, in order to gain a 15 certificate (PG13 in the states) and thereby increase its potential audience, this one is missing all the 'good stuff' that made the Piranha films so entertaining.

The first sign that this film ISN'T going to be as anywhere near as demented as either Piranha flick is when the first victim, a hot blonde in a tiny swimming costume, gets topless but fails to flash her goods and is then eaten by a shark in remarkably lame fashion. This unfulfilled promise of nudity and gore continues with the introduction of a group of college kids who take time out from studying to party at a lakeside villa, unaware that the water is teeming with voracious man-eaters (the reason for which is suitably daft); the girls (Sara Paxton, Katharine McPhee, and Alyssa Diaz) are all extremely fit, but apart from a brief bit of side-boob, there is no nekkidness, and the carnage is mostly limited to lots of blood in the water.

The result is a reasonably entertaining piece of popcorn fodder aimed squarely at a teen audience—mindless, logic-free fun for the duration, but instantly forgettable."

Permalink",False,"SHARK NIGHT 3D was clearly made to cash in on the surprise popularity of PIRANHA 3D, which wowed audiences with a mix of humour and gore. There are some moments in the movie that explicitly copy bits of PIRANHA 3D, like the scene with the girls getting dressed in their room: everything, the music, the editing, is exactly the same. Where this film falls apart, though, is in its family-friendly PG-13 rating, which means gorehounds desperate for their latest fix are going to be sorely disappointed by what's on offer.

The ludicrous plot sees a bunch of teenagers (a typically unlikeable group, without anyone to really vouch for or empathise with) gathering at a remote cabin on an island in the middle of a lake. What they don't know is that the lake is filled with killer sharks, thanks to the machinations of some rather lame bad guys whose storyline is never made believable in the slightest; the lack of budget hurts here, as what is supposed to be a large scale criminal operation comes across as a few guys hanging out on their boat and downing beer. When a paunchy Donal Logue is the only recognisable actor in the movie, you know it's in trouble.

What follows will surprise nobody, with CGI sharks eating people in relatively tame ways, although there are a few surprisingly vicious moments given the rating. It's kind of amusing in a cheap, B-movie way, although nowhere near as good as PIRANHA 3D; saying that, it's still miles ahead of the likes of MEGA SHARK VS GIANT OCTOPUS, which use up all their ideas in their titles and are so devoid of imagination and technical eptitude that they're definite Z-grade material. David R. Ellis, a stuntman-turned-director who took his own life recently, also handled the similarly disappointing SNAKES ON A PLANE and CELLULAR; his most entertaining films were his entries in the FINAL DESTINATION franchise."

Permalink",True,"I don't know how they surpassed it as a worse movie, but somehow, they managed.

""Shark Night"" is, without a doubt, the worst shark movie I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty of bad ones. ""Shark Night"" is worse than ""Shark Attack 3: Megalodon."" It makes ""Megashark vs. Giant Octopus"" look like high art. To quote Steve Martin in ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,"" it's not even amusing accidentally.

The ""surprises"" were all just one big barrel of ""duh"" from start to finish. They were cliché even for clichés. Let's see: two guys speeding through a shark-infested lake on a jet ski... hmm, wonder wonder if they're going to make it. A boat gets rocked with someone sitting on the side; no sir, never saw that coming. A caged woman tries to seduce her captor - whoa, that was completely out of left field!

One of the things that had me laughing out loud the most had to be the ""acting."" Between Sara Paxton's robotic mouthing of her lines and Dustin Milligan's late reactions, I can't decide who was worse. I mean yeah, nobody goes to horror films besides something along the lines of ""Alien"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"" to see excellent performances, but honestly, these two made Chuck Norris look like a thespian. The only real talent in this movie probably belonged to Joel David Moore and Joshua Leonard, both of whom should have handed the script back after one glance at it.

Another of the things that had me laughing out loud was the dialogue. For example, Nick passes out, and the sheriff says he ""thinks"" he fainted. That wasn't obvious enough? Did the sheriff also ""think"" that Sara was wearing a bikini? Did he ""think"" they were at a lake house?

But the absolute worst part of this movie had to be the fact that it was rated PG-13. Let's think about this for a minute; it's a horror film, for starters. Furthermore, it's a horror film about sharks, which means there's going to be plenty of carnage. Well, let's just say that there SHOULD have been plenty of carnage. The level of violence in this movie made a pimple look like a bite from a brown recluse spider. Why are so many directors trying to ""appeal to younger audiences"" by toning down everything? It's a HORROR FILM! Horror films are supposed to appeal to adults! Why don't you just have Disney make an animated ""Saw"" movie, for God's sake? They didn't even have the decency to release it unrated on DVD!

Oh, and speaking of PG-13, you know how it says ""for brief nudity"" among other things? Just a warning to all the guys out there who thought that may be some kind of compensation for this chum bucket of a movie; it isn't, though you ladies may find it to be mild compensation.

You'd think David R. Ellis and company would know better after giving us a decent first sequel to ""Final Destination,"" but no... and, sadly, ""Shark Night 3D"" was his last film. Even ""Snakes on a Plane"" had its moments of entertainment, at least compared to this. But ""Shark Night"" seriously has to be the most one-dimensional three-dimensional film ever released. It's almost as if they had a shark type the script.

And speaking of sharks, here's one final little tidbit of trivia I'd like to repeat for the millionth time in as many shark movies: SHARKS DON'T HAVE VOCAL CORDS. That's right; they can't roar, they can't growl, they pretty much can't do anything with their mouths but bite. And biting is the one thing that ""Shark Night"" does best.

Permalink",True,"This is probably the stupidest shark movie ever. Jaws was the first and in my opinion Jaws is the only really good shark movie... but Shark Night wasn't even semi good. More of the theater was laughing than covering their eyes. The sharks you could tell were computer animated and many scenes were questionable for example: When the guy is tied to a chair dangling over the computer animated sharks he burns the rope with a lighter, you see it is a cheap dollar tree lighter however he has been in the water just a few scenes back and to top it off why would he have a lighter with him? Now onto the casting... the casting was probably the biggest thrown together part of the movie. I didn't recognize any actors and the fact that the acting was terrible made it worse. They literally had to say everything verbally, their was little facial expressions and everything done was said out loud for example: When they are driving the guy to the hospital the other guy driving is saying over and over again ""It'll be okay, it'll be okay were almost their,etc.,etc."" It was just terrible. The final out of many annoying things I notices was the 3D! The 3D applied to one situation and that was when the shark jumped out at the audience at the very end... I admit that made me jump, besides that the 3D was pointless. I try to say one good thing about every movie but it's hard to say one for this.. I suppose it was entertaining to watch one the biggest horror film fails of 2011 go downhill quickly as the movie progressed... I kelp on thinking are the actors and directors trying to make a shark movie parody. Oveall if this movie was supposed to be serious it was a fail but if it was meant to be a poorly written, poorly directed and horribly acted comedy than it was a win... I think it was supposed to be good though...

Permalink",False,"What is it that makes a flick about sharks good? You need a vicious shark with some nasty attacks, just like Jaws (1975). Many flick tried to imitate Jaws and failed completely, this here we can add to that list. I watched it uncut and in 3D to be sure to not missing any action.

David R. Ellis the man behind Final Destination 2 and 4 directed this flick clearly made for the youth by giving it flashy editing. But it was rated 13 and there things went badly wrong. No gore in this flick, just one bite that leaves an arm behind. But overall it lacks on suspense or even red stuff. When the shark attacks you only see red water but towards the end the shark can do some supernatural things, a thing that tears it down again for horror buffs. Or you make a gory funny flick like Piranha (2010) which even takes it over the top or you keep it seriously. Towards the end it reminded me of Sand Sharks (2011) were they also can jump into the air.

On part of the 3D it worked out fine, the underwater scene's really gave you the feeling that you were underwater. Maybe one shot, exploding boat, was really made for 3D.

But we were also stuck with the characters. You had the sexy vamp undress and having tattoos, sadly when she undresses she only shows her back. Further on she becomes the weak one. You got the typical red neck situation and racism. You just couldn't care who was going to be prey. Strange to see that Sara Paxton (Sara Palski) couldn't do what see did in the gory remake of Last House On The Left (2009).

Overall, the 13 rate made it an uninteresting horror flick for the buffs.

Permalink",False,"Shark Night never harboured aspirations of being Jaws 2011, which is a good thing, as any film that does is doomed to failure and backlash from a film community still content with the first one.

But I didn't want Jaws 2011, I wanted a silly, gory, ridiculous flick with nature finally getting its own back on humanity for 90 minutes or so. Unfortunately the most joy I felt last night was walking up to the counter and exclaiming 'Two for Shark Night please', because everything after was at best bland and often atrocious.

Shark Night is deliberately shlocky and low budget, and features a cast of nobodies and the most familiar of horror movie settings: 7 college kids head off for a weekend of booze, parties and 'fraternising', then things go awry. That too doesn't need to be a bad thing, in fact many of those factors can be pluses if handled correctly. The last two decades have given us Anaconda, Deep Blue Sea and last year's Piranha, none of them great films, but all memorable and worthy of discussion when 'animal attack' movies come up.

All we as a movie-going public want is a decent menacing creature, some inventive kills, a few chuckles and – if there's time - some nubile young skin. We don't care if the stars of the movie are dodgy fake looking CGI and equally dodgy fake looking boobies, we want our 80 minutes of eating popcorn and laughing guilt free at things that would be horrible if they happened in real life.

Unfortunately Shark Night either forgot or decided to ignore the rules half way in. This is not a Piranha type fun gore 'n' skin flick, this is something else altogether, something that will be forgotten in 12 months.

From memory the first half of the film goes just like this: Opening chomp. Credits. Inane dialogue. Bikini babes. Gormless guys. Inane dialogue. Get in car. Meet the locals. Chomp. Bikinis. Beefcake. Bikinis. Chomp. Explosion. Hysteria. Bikinis. Bikinis. Bikinis.

I might have mixed a chomp and bikini somewhere but you get the gist, the film is set up for some mindless fun, where sharks can not only keep pace with speedboats hurtling along at full tilt but they can actually get alongside and ram them. Where at one point a bikini clad lass is trapped underwater for so long that you must start to wonder if her brain cells might start dying through lack of oxygen, before you swiftly realize that with these kids that wasn't a big problem Unfortunately shortly after they 'meet the locals' a second time the film takes an unwelcome turn, because in this case the locals I refer to aren't actually the sharks but real, walkin' (sorta) talking' redneck locals. Perhaps most troublingly locals who google.

Let me be perfectly straightforward, the film was hardly creative to this point, but the sudden dip in quality from this point on is simply breathtaking.

I won't 'spoil' this film (the scriptwriter and filmmakers did that already) but what was threatening to turn out to be big dumb fun quickly lost any rights to the use of the word 'fun', and we know what that leaves Might I finish by simply saying if you have a film with a bunch of hot chicks drinking and cavorting, surely there is a better justification for near nudity than implied rape? When 'fun' turns to 'mean' in the blink of an eye, it's time to go home. Or if you haven't seen Shark Night, perhaps stay there, this crap won't make you happy you went out.

Final Rating – 3 / 10. Sharks have bad enough reputation without being associated with films like this."

Permalink",False,"""That's a mighty fine rack of lamb.""

A group of college kids visits the lakeside home of a friend in order to celebrate and have some fun. Menacing locals are a quickly forgotten problem when a shark attacks one of them and they're forced to try to find some way to get help. 

Shark Night isn't a terrible movie. It's just nothing remarkable. Almost a ""tv movie of the week"" version of a shark attack movie. The story starts of as forced and stale, before taking a turn for the utterly ridiculous. 

The gore is toned down and the titillation is PG-13 at most (as is the movie rating). This isn't exactly the movie to seek out if you're looking for gore. It's just a few B-level actors and actresses getting munched on by fake-looking sharks (and mostly off-camera or obscured by water). There's one squirm-inducing death that's worth seeing, but it's over way too quickly and nothing that follows matches it.

The characters are so stereotypically written that it must have been done on purpose. You've got the shy, handsome nerd who's inexperienced with women, the annoying sidekick, the self-obsessed dumb guy, the tough-talking dude with a promising football future and a rough past in the hood, the slutty girl, and the all-American sweet love interest with ""dark secrets"" in her past that come back to haunt her. Oh, and a couple of the most over-the-top (and strangely knowledgeable) redneck characters I've ever seen. They all get way more screen-time than the sharks, which doesn't really make sense in a movie called ""Shark Night"". 

Like I said, this isn't an awful movie. It just doesn't do much to justify its own existence. There's no real tension or menace to be had, here. It won't scare you like Jaws, and it won't entertain you while making you wince like the recent Piranha remake. Watch it if you're really bored (like I did), but this isn't a ""must see"" by any definition of the phrase. I have to admit, though, that Sara Paxton looks unbelievable in a bikini. Sign me up for some more of that, but keep the rest. "

Permalink",True,"I tried to give this movie a chance even after hearing SEVERAL bad reviews for it. I figured it might be humorous like Piranha 3D (Didn't much like that one either...but at least I didn't fast-forward). This movie takes itself far too seriously. There is absolutely no character development. The stereotypes and cheep ""scares"" are so bland that you cringe just sitting through them. Even the shark attacks were droll. You actually don't really see the shark attack...you just see the water slosh and then red coloring comes to the top (sometimes). Yes, there is even a kill in the movie where you don't see any blood...just splashing and frothing water. =/ On top of that, the dialogue is tiresome. I found myself checking Facebook, IMDb, E-mail, and whatever else I could find online during the ""heart felt"" monologues that our leads decide to indulge us in. You know who will survive immediately after the film starts. The only African American in the film doesn't actually die first, but he does wield a spear. And the only Latin American character is the first to get it...frothing in bloodless water...LMAO. So cheers. Save your time. Don't even torrent this movie.

Paxton's character is adorable but her relationship to the villains is just stupid, like an impossibly vapid Dawson's's creek episode. the sharks do not fare well either in this cinematic garbage.

How did these sharks get here? God knows but Joel David Moore states at the beginning of the film that ""it's not impossible"". Well there we go then! The sharks themselves are pitifully rendered and evoke absolutely no scares, just laughs. But is it enjoyable, comedic laughs I produce? No, it's a guffaw that I'm still sitting in my seat and not spearing the screen.

So if you like gory movies then I don't recommend it. The 3D is good. Much better then Saw 3D and other 3D movies which were disappointing. In Shark Night 3D a lot of things come flying out at you and there not just sharks. So if you choose to watch this watch it in 3D. In general its an good movie and everyone is saying its awful and I have to admit the plot was kind of lazy and boring but its not as bad as everyone is saying. I walked into the theater with no hope but I left the theater happier the when I came in. I RECOMMEND IT.

Scenes are freaky and frightening, thats part of it. The movie doesn't involve in only fighting and trying to kill the shark, but also, fights between teenagers themselves. The movie is kind of bloody to have an PG-13 rating, so this is one of those movies you''ll be tricked. It's full of jump-out-of-your-seat scenes, since almost every time the teens are in the water, the shark will definitely and predictably appear and kill one of the group.

It's truly amazing!

Permalink",True,"I (and thousands of moviegoers and critics with any common sense) ranted about this limp piece of uncreative fluff when they first announced it would be a worthless PG-13. I also refused to see it. Well, unfortunately, I did have to see it on DVD last night when some friends rented it and popped it into their player. And it was even WORSE than I EVER imagined.

It was like the writers and director stole the Slasher Flick 101 Handbook (which, BTW, stopped being interesting in the freaking '80s) and followed it word for freaking word: 1. Group of diverse college kids (made up of the standard cute innocent girl, a slightly-dorky guy we know she will fall for, a horn-dog dork goof ball comedienne, a dimwitted jock, a black guy and two sluts), drive into the deep woods for the weekend to drink and bang each other.

2. They run into the redneck creepy perverted locals and the small town sheriff (who we all know is in league with the redneck creepy perverted locals the moment he shows up) on the way.

3. They get to the house where the drinking and killing quickly begin while doing incredibly stupid things that hasten their demise.

4. But instead of having redneck, backwoods slasher psychotic freaks, they used sharks instead....which were put IN the lake by redneck, backwoods slasher psychotic freaks.

YAWN.

And this was all played out in every predictable way possible (including the revelation of who put the sharks in the water, the shark jumping out of the water to get the guy on the jet ski, and the idiotic last shot of a shark jumping out of the water in the end). All of us in the room watching the DVD called out each and every scene before it happened because we'd all seen it a countless times before in a hundred different movies.

But the absolute biggest problem (as every pone knows) with this bird dropping of a flick was the rating. While the slasher films this turd ripped off are rightly rated R and contain hardcore blood, guts and hot naked women to help offset their pathetic attempt at a screenplay and acting, this PG-13 rated excuse for a movie has none of that.

It's all G-rated screaming, churning water and blood rising up while the attacks happen below the water out of sight! Did you read that? Outofsight!! People don't pay their hard earned money to NOT see things on the (bleeping) screen! As for nudity, all we got were teaser shots of girls in bikinis the entire time, something we can see in every lame magazine and TV show these days. Oh, but they did show the bare butt of the freaking jock! Who the hell did the director think would want to see that? Did he think his audience was going to be filled with women and gay guys only? Then again, maybe it was since this stinker only made a few million in the theaters -- even with the extra $3 charge for 3D glasses.

The SyFy Channel (while still too GUTLESS to show nudity) will at least show hardcore blood and guts when people get attacked by the cartoon sharks and creatures in their films. BTW their cartoon sharks and creatures look even more realistic than the sharks in this supposedly big-budget film.

The hacks who wrote, produced and directed this thing should have at least made an R or unrated version to release on DVD with the blood, guts and boobs they left out (along with any entertainment value at all) in the theatrical version. But apparently -- based on what they did release -- they aren't that smart. They definitely have no idea what people want to see in a shark film (Hint: think ""Piranha"" and its upcoming sequel).

Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this mess. And if you just happened to read my post because you don't mind spoilers, don't worry. There are no spoilers here -- because you've seen it all before. In fact, you've seen so much more in other films than you will in this one.

Permalink",True,"I saw this one at the drive-in, but thankfully it was backed up by ""Fright Night"".

The premise is very simple: Sharks in a lake start eating the college kids who go into the lake.

There is somewhat of back-story involving the hillbillies that put the sharks in the lake and attached cameras to them to record the sharks eating people, which then they would sell to get money. Lots of money. It takes itself WAY too seriously.

The villainous hicks in the film are relatively more scary than the actual sharks in the film.

I completely lost interest in the film when they killed off the most interesting character (Joel David Moore; of ""Avatar"", ""Hatchet"", and ""Grandma's Boy"" fame.)

I can't say much about this one. If you want to watch something of this quality, watch the Sci-Fi channel on a Saturday night. This DID NOT need to make it to the big screen.

If Your looking for a serious and unpredictable horror film, then this isn't it. But Shark Night is fun and honestly I was surprised by a couple parts. I can't bring myself to call this a horror movie, more of an action flick.

On the downside, You never really care about any of the characters, and the movie is fairly clichéd.

On the upside, the effects are good, and story is surprisingly good too.

I would recommend Alexander Aja's Piranha over this. But Shark Night is still pretty entertaining."

They actually look better than some CG in recent big budget movies.

An attractive cast heads up the story, which is not nearly as far-fetched as most films in this sub-genre. It's played straight, no corny humor, and the actors are very believable. There's plenty of genuine suspense and real horror movie thrills.

The photography is excellent, the location is sometimes stunningly beautiful. Overall the production values are topnotch.

Permalink",False,"Friday the 13th with sharks.

That pretty much sums up the plot for Shark Night 3D. It's the tried-and-true formula of putting a group of young adults in an isolated wilderness environment and then slaughtering them one by one, either by a maniac in a hockey mask or, in this particular case, big fish with teeth and a ravenous appetite. If you understand that's what you're in for going in to things, then Shark Night 3D won't disappoint.

The mayhem is all quite competently staged. Director David R. Ellis knows what looks good on camera and even in that most dubious of cinematic blessings, 3D. Ellis has some unique visual tricks up his sleeve and the movie is colorfully and atmospherically shot. The shark attacks that are at the core of the story are well-done, although some horror fans may be let down by the relative lack of gore—this is, after all, a PG-13 film, and the carnage therefore a bit restrained. Still, the numerous shark attacks usually pack a surprising punch and the proceedings are certainly not devoid of blood, if that's your thing. Moreover, the 3D effects are put to pretty good use, and in a number of scenes garishly fanged shark snouts seem to swim right out of the screen at you. Nice.

The cast seems to be having a good time and everybody does a professional job. Of course, the script doesn't tell us much about most of the characters, who exist primarily to be eaten by the voracious sharks, but at least none of them are totally unlikeable The story's protagonists are Sara (played by the very hot Sarah Paxton) and her potential boyfriend, Nick (Dustin Milligan), and we do get to learn a little more about them. Sara is troubled by something that happened four years ago, something that has perhaps come back to haunt her once more, and Nick is a shy, rather nerdy medical student with a seemingly hopeless crush on Sara. Both actors are charismatic and create characters it's easy to identify with.

Shark Night 3D isn't food for deep thought, but if you like b-movies and can appreciate their unique charms, then this is a very fun movie. It doesn't compare well to Jaws or even the more recent thriller The Reef, but then it's really not built to compete with those films. This movie's role model is something more along the lines of, you guessed it, Friday the 13th. And for what it's worth, I think Jason Voorhees would be proud."

Permalink",False,"I read some reviews on here before checking it out on Netflix and based on the low rating and on the reviews the movie isn't at all garbage. If it's somewhat decent to the rest of the shark night movies mixed with some of today's cast. Although some actors I have never seen before but the whole movie isn't bad.

The start was alright nothing to big and exciting and the acting throughout the whole movie was alright typical for your teen/college characters. There wasn't allot of scare scenes and most of the movie was not at all overly clingy. I kinda liked how the whole thing played out, defiantly a twist I did not see coming from some characters in the movie.

This is a pretty good for a Saturday night or Friday night when you're home alone and bored and want something that is light and not gory like Piranha was because there wasn't allot of blood.

I give this movie a 6/10."

Permalink",False,"Shark Night's only real sin is that it plays to a PG-13 audience. That's OK for a film like Jaws which has powerful performances and wonderful characters. Not to mention incredible suspense. But if you're going to make a cheap and nasty killer animal film, make it nasty. Still, there are lots of things to enjoy here for lovers of such a crappy genre. A group of teens suffering from a disease that makes them look like they are in their mid-twenties, go on an island vacation. No phones, no internet, no contact with the outside world. Bliss. Unluckily for them, but luckily for the audience, there are some sharks to tear these guys apart. Same as ever, but with some particularly bad CGI, it includes some unique scenes that get you excited. Best of all is a one armed man going to fight a hammerhead with nothing but a spear and his fists. It was also fun to see Joshua Leonard as a real creepy hick. Daft dialogue, annoying characters, but a bit of fun. Don't take it too seriously.

So what a bunch of rednecks put some sharks into a lake and started feeding random people to them that to me is better then watching the same random jaws rip off it was funny and fun i had a great time.My favorite scene is when the black guy killed the hammer head with a spear. Also when the guy on the wave runner to get ripped off by the great white. All and all a campy movie one that i will watch one more time with some friend.

Permalink",True,"For those who would enjoy an updated Jaws type thriller this will be right for them. Don't expect too much and it will be fun. It isn't too gory so it's okay to watch as a thriller. The cast is likable and attractive with Sarah Paxton as the lead and even Katherine McPhee - thank goodness she got Smash to utilise her talents instead of doing this type of movie. The supporting cast is okay with Dustin Milligan and Chris Zylka. It's quite nicely photographed. You know what to expect - the usual devourings.

Weak points: The rather exaggerated revenge plot by the bad guys and how isolated they are.

Overall it's quite good fun for this type of movie.

For instance the central characters are a bunch of college graduates in their early to mid 20's so obviously this film was aimed at teenagers instead of fans of killer shark films, in one way its not a bad thing in the other many people are not going to want to see a kids movie they would want to see a suspense packed, fast pace and very intense shark movie and like I said SHARK NIGHT is not that movie.

Overall, SHARK NIGHT isn't a terrible movie but its more of shark movie for kids, all that we need now is a shark movie for adults."

Permalink",True,"Actors: Sara Paxton, Alyssa Diaz, Dustin Milligan, Katharine McPhee, and Joel David Moore.

Plot: A group of college kids head on up to their friend Sarah's lake house, on a secluded Louisiana lake. But much to their demise what they do not know is that this salt water lake is infested with various species of sharks. The question is how did they get into this lake and why? ACTING: Not much to say, it's a horror movie. Beside let's face it they are only as good as the script permits.

TONE: Serious and dark horror movie, with a huge lack of thrills and suspense.

SCRIPT: A ""B"" movie script. I will say the concept is MOSTLY original. Cheesy all around, dry humour (wait was their any?). Scream meets Jaws (that's a first!).

PROS: Entertaining (for viewers with a respect for ""B"" movies). Cool variety of sharks.

CONS: Rather ludicrous (no matter which way you flip the coin). Dissatisfying shark attacks and not nearly enough carnage for this genre. You hardly see the sharks.

VERDICT: Whatever you do DO NOT BUY this movie BEFORE PREVIEWING it because I guarantee, you will be disappointed. I am one of those who bought this film before previewing, and I knew the risks. I don't regret this purchase because under the RIGHT circumstances this film is extremely mindless and fun to watch in all of it's awfulness (sometimes you just have to love it for what it is). I will say that I do love the irony the film conveys, the antagonists are filming the shark attacks (sound like another scary movie that just came out not too long before? --> ""Scream 4"") and one of the character's say that people would pay to see some sharks eating people (isn't that what WE paid to see?). The problem with Shark Night is that it takes itself seriously, and with it's plot how can you? I believe that is the only thing that actually makes this film humorous. But honestly if you have no respect for ""B"" movies just avoid this one. If you are looking for something just as brainless but done right, go out and rent or buy Piranha (the 1978 original or the 2010 remake) they're both campy fun! But if you're looking for a fun shark movie, I always liked Deep Blue Sea, than of course their is Jaws and its campy successors.

Permalink",True,"Shark Night 3D?, for a movie that had roughly ""10"" shots containing a few seconds of 3D action I think the necessity of adding on the title was a little too much. However, this was nothing compared to the problems it had.

OK,you are introduced to normal bunch of college kids as with every teen horror movie you'd expect. For once, they didn't come across as annoying. We get the short introduction to each of them. They all get together for a big short college trip at the lake, nothing much. I should of foreseen this as a warning flag, but i wanted to give this movie a chance.

One of them of which is ""Joel David Moore"". Dr. Norm Spellman from David Cameron's ""Avatar"". That was a surprise really. Despite only getting about 2-3 big scenes in the movie. He helped the movie's dialog a bit. Every other character was just generic.

This was glossed over as the shots provided a good distraction. Surprisingly, there a number of scenes in which the camera work did look OK. The boat sequences especially. The use of the location was definitely being shown.

Sadly,It wasn't until after ""20 minutes"" that the movie started to go downhill. Rather than go down the great slow buildup route with the shark like the movie ""Jaws"". They thought it would be best to reveal the shark right in front of you. Spoil it right there. That was the first strike against it.

The second strike was the hillbilly side characters. Like the college students, their acting wasn't painful to see. However, it was ""who"" the hillbilly characters really were that hurt badly.

This is because it turns out the shark attack was caused by them. They managed to bring ""46"" species of sharks into the lake. They don't even show every species they said they brought. So what was the point. They managed to achieve that without anyone asking any questions? For that matter, wouldn't of someone noticed one of these sharks in the lake and called......lets see....National Geographic?? I mean its filled with sharks. They would be all over that lake. In addition, couldn't the great white shark or a tiger shark been enough to kill off the college characters?, a couple of those at most would of done the job easily.

This is what kills the movie for me. A lake filled with a encyclopedia database of sharks brought by a few angry hillbillies just to kill a few college students and send it to National Geographic. If that isn't a good plan, then i don't know what is.

I was glad the Avatar guy's character was spared from that terrible plot twist. It was just really dumb after that.

Even so, there was a few funny scenes. For example, there was a funny scene in which the male lead falls unconscious because of a drug in some soup a hillbilly cop brought. To be honest, I think he couldn't bear to be in the movie anymore. After being drugged, he is taken captive inside a river shack containing a tiger shark. When he is about to be fed, the cop explains their evil scheme.The conversation between the cop and him is just hilarious.

Honestly, I was going to give this movie a ""4"" out of ""10"". The acting was average. The plot is stupid, but i've heard worse. Effects are passable at best for what little there is. It isn't ""Lake Placid 2"" if that's anything to be proud of. This was until after I reached the credits and heard their ""rapping"" song came on. That was the final blow for the movie. I know i took this movie too seriously, but even a monster movie has been done well. Despite this, I would recommend watching it. It isn't as dumb as you expect, but its good to laugh at anyway.

Permalink",False,"Shark Night 3D

Man, I hate shark night at the ballpark. Last time I couldn't see the game on account of the stupid whale shark someone brought.

Fortunately, this is a horror movie about a shark outbreak and not some outlandish theme-night.

In need of a break, university students (Katharine McPhee, Joel David Moore Sinqua Walls, Alyssa Diaz, Dustin Milligan, Chris Zylka) invade their friend Sara's (Sara Paxton) Louisiana summerhouse.

But when a shark attacks their friend, their vacation becomes a bloodbath.

And when Sara asks her ex-boyfriend (Chris Carmack) to help them, he instead reveals to her and her friends the man-made origin of the lake's shark infestation.

Starting out as a cheap thriller, over time Shark Night's horrendous one-liners and insane plot form the foundation of a cult classic.

As for sharks living in public lakes, if they can handle the high content of human excrement than more power to them. (Yellow Light)

Permalink",False,"The best part of this film is actually post end-credits, where a music video of a rap song comes on with most of the cast hamming it up and performing very out of character, singing about the story, their characters and their demise, with clips from the film and that of behind the scenes during production. So don't leave the hall just yet because this comes on right at the end, which trumps the film proper since Shark Night was taking itself way too seriously.

Directed by David R. Ellis who was at the helm of films such as Snakes on a Plane and The Final Destination, you would have thought a film like Shark Night will be in safe hands, but alas the story by Will Hayes and Jesse Studenberg found itself desperate in trying not to repeat the usual formula that so many shark films have found itself stuck in given the aftermath of Jaws. And it's not easy, so much so that in this story we have sharks, and not just one single species but a variety of them, existing in a salt water lake, and takes on some torture porn proportions, if not for Ellis' obsession in thinking that a film that has water and sharks, must feature plenty of tight buttock in bikini bottom shots prominently to please its intended target audience.

As the story goes we have a group of seven students who decide to spend a relaxing weekend in one of their friend's lake house, if only for a bad wakeboarding episode to spark off a series of incidents and raising their awareness that the waters in the lake isn't safe to be in given the presence of extremely stealthy characters. Ellis junks the idea of showing the fin in the horizon, an art perfected in Jaws and over-utilized by anyone involved in a shark film production to try and ramp up suspense. Here, any buildup gets thrown out the window, opting for very direct, in your face chomping of limbs. There's a money shot involved which I have to admit is very well done on film involving a flying shark, although this could be something that exists only in the movies.

Don't expect any power-acting from any of the cast members, led by Sara Paxton playing her namesake and the rest playing the usual caricatures - the male himbo, the female slut, an athlete, the nerd and so on, or plot development that has depth that goes beyond the usual numbers being made into fodder, with the introduction of a sheriff and two additional good for nothing hoodlums. As with most monster movies, the central plot involved staying alive and getting out of the danger area, and it's nothing different in Shark Night as well, with events transpiring over the course of 24 hours, with an introductory kill thrown in for good measure.

Special effects wise, perhaps I did not view this in 3D as its intended format that the entire film lacked depth and looked way flatter than any other normal 2D film. The sharks looked horribly CG-ed and unrefined in the final product on film, and I thought this kind of shoddy work would have been more forgivable if this was a direct-to-video title rather than something meant to be projected on a large screen. Ideas were clearly running dry as well with each kill over relying on shots that featured water from a jacuzzi, with the fateful human victim thrashing around and underwater shots of sharks exercising their razor sharp teeth.

Shark films are really a dime a dozen and it's indeed a challenge to come up with something truly different and worthwhile of one's time. Unfortunately Shark Night isn't the messiah, although I suspect one will get a lot more from it if it's viewed in gimmicky 3D, since there were plenty of shots with the sharks leaping toward the screen, jaws wide open and primed for some major chomping."

Permalink",False,"There is a certain simplicity to the pleasures which 'Shark Night' offers, made unabashedly in the spirit of last summer's 'Piranha 3D' by way of Steven Spielberg's classic 'Jaws'. It holds no pretension, it knows exactly what it wishes to accomplish, and it achieves its objective beautifully (and we mean this literally).

Indeed, director David R. Ellis has assembled a bunch of young, nubile buff and buxom collegiates for his latest exercise in camp- among them 'The Last House on the Left's Sara Paxton, '90210's' Dustin Milligan and former American Idol's Katharine McPhee. They are just three of a group of seven Tulane University undergrads who head to the Louisiana bayou for a weekend of fun at Sara's lake cabin when the predators attack.

And the honour of first bite goes to football stud Malik (Sinqua Walls) whose right arm is chewed off just 15 minutes into the movie, demonstrating just how quickly Ellis gets to the meat of the business (pun intended). Thereafter, writers Will Hayes and Jesse Studenberg spend the rest of the first half of the movie letting the rest of their politically-correct ethnically diverse cast of characters figure out how to get him to the nearest hospital- though for narrative convenience, the island which they are on also has zero reception, so getting help isn't just a call away.

The falling of night at the halfway mark brings some newfound thrills as two hillybilly-accented rednecks descend upon the cabin on the pretence of bringing help. Their intentions are however far less dignified, as it turns out that the nefarious pair is in fact responsible for using the lake for their private snuff film factory- their target audience the fans of 'Shark Week', apparently the longest-running TV show on cable. There's also an equally dubious local sheriff (played by 'Terriers' star Donal Logue) who's just about the only other person around the island.

So credibility isn't one of the movie's strong suites, but frankly we wouldn't have expected otherwise- B-movies usually thrive on a minimal setup, preferring to hedge their bets with their audience on easy cheap thrills. Ellis knows this well- his career defined with such genre stuff like 'Snakes on a Plane' and two 'Final Destination' movies- and his experience shows with the tight pacing he keeps throughout the entire film, so much so that you're not likely to think about the plot loopholes and narrative contrivances.

But Ellis also seems hemmed in by the insistence of the producers on making this a PG-13 affair- so those expecting another exercise in excess a la 'Piranha 3D' be warned, there is only tease here. To his credit, he tries the darnest to test the limits of the rating, and this is obvious right from the opening shot that has d.p. Gary Capo tracking a young woman from below the waist as she bounces in the water and subsequently removes her top. There is no frontal nudity for the record, and no scenes of any body part getting bitten of, just bikinis and blood in equally small measure (though in this regard, as little of the former is definitely more exciting than the latter).

Though the lack of explicit gore and nudity does mean that this is less tongue-in-cheek fun than last year's Dimension gnasher (which coincidentally is getting a sequel called 'Piranha 3DD'), Ellis compensates with tenser and more coherent plotting- and the result is a solid, well-made B-movie that offers enough trashy thrills for those looking for some adrenaline fix. The 3D only adds marginally to the excitement, but stay past the end credits for a rap video recap with the cast that boasts the tongue-in-cheek humour the main feature could do with more of."

Permalink",False,"I went in to this movie expecting something as outrageous as Piranaha 3D so I was a little disappointed at how tame it was in comparison.

A group of kids go to a lake house for some bikini and briefs water based fun. This all goes awry when they discover the sharks who are chilling out in the waters nearby. Add to this the two back water goons and the irresponsible sheriff and you just know the waters aren't going to stay clear for long.

From the beginning of the movie I was wondering how they were going to explain the sharks being there. I actually thought that the story behind that was a pretty good Idea when it's explained and brought something new to the killer shark sub genre.

The acting was pretty solid throughout, not that it matters as the kids are just there to look pretty and be eaten. The sharks seemed to be done almost entirely with CGI which I found a little disappointing but they still looked great.

Where Shark night 3D fell short of other killer fish features was the gore. If you make a movie about killer sharks you've got to show people getting mauled by the sharks. It's not enough to see them thrashed about from above the water. There are a couple of cool scenes where one of the sharks leaps out of the water to drag a victim under but nothing more brutal which was a real shame. Also considering all the flesh on show there was surprisingly no nudity. If you like that sort of thing.

Shark night is by no means bad, just at times it felt like a missed opportunity. I enjoyed it as a great fun popcorn movie."

Permalink",True,"You might think this movie is about one character after another being eaten by a shark, but, aside from the prologue, and an arm being torn off, it's not the sharks that are causing the real trouble. This is no ""Piranha"", but it still is a fun movie to sit through. What I didn't realize, however, is that these sharks were actually dumped in the water by a couple of bad guys. I may not have seen this story line coming, but it sure made a slightly interesting movie more so. These are true villains, people that you love to hate, and it gives this movie some suspense. Another thing: Just when you think the sheriff couldn't be behind it, it turns out he is. The film is called ""Shark Night"", which explains why the movie takes a while to get where it's going.

1/2 (out of 4)

A girl takes her six friends back home to her Louisiana Gult house where they plan on a weekend of fun but things change when one of them are attacked by a shark. With the friend bleeding to death, the others must find a way off the island but the sharks have their own ideas. Congratulations must go to director David R. Ellis who managed to make the worst film of 2009 (THE FINAL DESTINATION) and it seems as if he's going to make the worst for 2011. I don't mean to be mean but I hate walking out of a theater angry and for two films in a row this is exactly what Ellis has done. I'm sorry but if you don't know how to make 3D work then you really shouldn't be making a 3D movies. If you can't direct actors to do dramatic scenes then you should probably ask the screenwriter to leave these scenes out of a movie. If you make some sort of thriller and can't bring any suspense then perhaps you should just pass on the project. In reality, I understand it's a job and the paycheck is something that even I would take but the only problem is those poor fools such as myself who are laying down hard earned dollars for this crap. SHARK NIGHT 3D is an incredibly stupid movie that features really bad dialogue, horrible, unscary situations and a story that is so silly that you really want to start throwing things a the screen. I'm going to be nice and not ruin a few ""twists"" in the film in regards to why the sharks are doing what they're doing and how they got into a lake but those who do walk into the movie should be expecting something so stupid that not even something like MEGA SHARK VS. GIANT OCTOPUS would have to guts to attempt. The PG-13 rating certainly hurts the shark attacks as they're all rather lame as we don't get to see any violence or gore. Yes, you can make a horror movie without the violence and gore but if you do this then you at least need to deliver some suspense and since that never happens you might as well go the cheap route and throw out some blood. The 3D effects are put to use a couple good times when things come flying at the screen but most of the attacks don't benefit from the format. I thought the majority of the actors did as well as you could expect with Sara Paxton, Dustin Milligan and Sinqa Walls sticking out. SHARK NIGHT 3D is a really bad movie and thankfully it gets bad enough at points where you can at least get a few laughs out of it. I'm the type who really enjoy bad movies but these type of films should go directly to something like SyFy Channel or DVD where viewers don't have to pay much. When a film asks you to spend $11 or more then it needs to be of higher quality and this film is just a complete rip-off without anything going for it."

Permalink",False,"'SHARK NIGHT': Three Stars (Out of Five)

In the tradition of 'B' tongue in cheek animals gone wild horror films like 'PIRANHA', 'LAKE PLACID' and 'DEEP BLUE SEA' comes 'SHARK NIGHT'. It's not nearly as good as those other films but it does know what it is and has fun with it. Actor and stuntman turned director David R. Ellis (who also directed such other campy would be classics as 'SNAKES ON A PLANE', 'CELLULAR', FINAL DESTINATION 2' and 'THE FINAL DESTINATION') says he wanted to title the movie 'Untitled 3D Shark Thriller' but was eventually shot down. The movie was released in 3D and is the perfect type of film to see that way but I chose to see it in 2D due to budget restraints. It was written by first time writers Will Hayes and Jesse Studenberg and stars the likes of Sara Paxton, Dustin Milligan, Chris Carmack, Joel David Moore and Donal Logue. The movie is somewhat fun, cheesy and humorous but still it lacks anything distinct or original to set it apart from the rest.

It tells the story of seven college students in Louisiana who take vacation at a secluded lake house belonging to one, Sara (Paxton), of their families. It had been three years since Sara had been back there and right away she runs into her old boyfriend Dennis (Carmack) and the local Sheriff (Logue) she was buddies with. It becomes apparent to Sara's friends and the viewers that she has some dark memories there and it's a little uneasy for her being back. Nick (Milligan) is especially interested in Sara and her well being as it becomes obvious that he has feelings for her. These issues are quickly forgotten when the vacationers find themselves under attack by vicious sharks who are not native to the area. When one is seriously injured they try to quickly get him to help but soon find themselves all falling victim to the ferocious beasts.

The movie of course falls under the category of 'so bad it's good' so critiquing any ridiculousness or plausibility is absurd and ridiculous. The question is always solely whether a movie like this is entertaining or not and this one is but only to a certain extent. For one thing there's not enough blood or gore and absolutely no nudity or sex. This is largely due to the fact that the movie went for a PG-13 rating rather than the usual R in order to hopefully attract more viewers but I think this ultimately ended up hurting the film more than helping it. There will probably be an unrated DVD\bluray cut that might be better but as far as the theatrical release is concerned it's weakened by it's attempt to censor itself (which most films are). Another thing that's lacking in the film is acting. The cast is so generic and bad (with the exception of Moore and Logue who are always scene stealers) and they're not even uniquely bad (or that hot) they're just boring. Even by 'B' movie standards this cast is just uninspired. The directing and writing are OK for this type of film but again nothing new or exciting. There is a cool after the credits rap video by the cast that adds a little something special to the overall experience of the film, if you wait for it, but for the most part the film is mostly forgettable (like most of it's type).

Permalink",False,"I love being in the water. I find sharks to be some of the coolest and most interesting creatures on the planet. I don't even mind cheesy 3D movies if there are a few fun effects of stuff popping out at me. So the idea of sharks jumping out at me in 3D was intriguing and I had to go on opening weekend. The three stars in the rating are because there were a few times that sharks jumped out of the screen at me, and because of one really lovely shot. I will also give a bit of credit because the filmmakers did an OK job at explaining plot annoyances like why (some of) the sharks are able to live in the lake and why they don't just leave, etc.

There is also an attempt to play with the conventions of shark-attack genre but such attempted cleverness actually made things worse because it seems like they COULD have made a sassy and fun shark movie in the vein of the original Piranha and last summer's remake but they got lazy and left us with this mess. Performances were ""meh"" all around; no one stands out in my memory as particularly bad or good. Oh, and it's PG-13 instead of an R so there aren't even any good crazy kills to get you talking. If you manage to stay awake and can get through the end of the credits, you'll find a fairly amusing rap video featuring the cast. While it's not comedy gold, it's certainly more entertaining than 95% of the movie it's promoting.

With absent expectations, a fetish for sharks, and a desire for some exploitative cinema, how could this possibly fail? It does and when it does, it fails on every account. See, you can deliver what you promise and still partially succeed. But when you can't even deliver on what you promise, that's when the credibility factor just takes a downward spiral. With such an intimidating title, you'd think the film would either be like a roller coaster ride (ala ""Piranha 3D) or an unnerving, off-the-rails thriller (""Jaws""), but instead it ends up being neither.

Going into the film, I was fully aware of the uncompromising drawbacks of gratuitous nudity and gore. While I was vastly disappointed to witness the butchered rating, I still gave the film a chance even with the rancid reviews. Even on that account, it still sucked. The acting, expectedly lacking, lacks more. The story, which sounds like an interesting premise, sinks. The direction, expectingly subpar, is incoherent. The kills, while weak may show some promise, fall flatter. And lastly, what a B-flick does best is entertain. This film can't even do that. Sure it has the break-neck pace of an MTV reality TV show, certainly edited like one, every scene lacks in substance and the style is too teeny bopper and shabby.

Let me give you ""Shark Night"". Take ""Jaws"", remove everything great about that movie, replace the oldies with some hip, wet, and wild twenty somethings, and add the break-neck pace like ""Piranha 3D"" and you have this movie. All in all, this wasn't just the worst movie of the summer, it's one of the worst of the year. Never have I seen a movie this lazily and sloppily put together in a while. Oh wait, when's the last time I saw that? Back in '09 with David R. Ellis' ""The Final Destination"". It's funny how both showed true signs of potential yet blew it, save for the decent 3D. The only decent movie the guy's done is ""Snakes on a Plane"", but he even was only co-director. Nothing new hear to see folks. Yawn!"

Permalink",True,"3 D shark attack is not the best film of the summer! The name 3 D Shark Attack should be a dead give away for the quality of this movie! The story is about the people who put sharks in a lake and film the eating people in order to make money. Cheesy film with 3 D effects. The 3 D was okay. Some 3 D effects like explosions were cool, while other parts were lame. Sometimes there was no real 3 D at all. Watch this movie for the 3 D. I would not watch this film in 2 D. There were no big name actors in this one. The bad guy's teeth were disgusting! The film used a lot of 80's heavy metal in it. I give this film a 6 out of 10 in 3 D and 5 out of 10 in 2 D.

Permalink",False,"Shark Night 3D has a simple plot and its nothing we haven't seen before - college students on a deserted island with shark infested waters.

This movie has a very predictable plot and very little character development even on the main characters which doesn't make you feel anything when a character dies. You can guess how the sharks got in the water way before the movie is even half over, which completely killed some of the fun.

If the plot doesn't make you iffy then you would look at the cast, most of whose names many of us have never heard of. The only really good performance in this movie was from Dustin Milligan, his acting was solid.

The movie was just to un-realistic for my liking. For instance, sharks don't leap out of the water often nor do they attack every human being. On top of that the movie's shark kill scenes are basically screaming and bloody water, there is little to no gore. The 3D was good when underwater but otherwise it did nothing for the movie.The movie isn't even a horror, there are just moments of suspense before the kill and that's it.The 3D was used well in some parts but for the majority of the movie it was not necessary.

So if you're in the mood for half-naked college students, some suspense and blood and a movie with a predictable plot, Shark Night 3D is the movie for you! Otherwise, you should pass on this one."

Permalink",True,"MAJOR PLOT SPOILER!

SHARK NIGHT 3D - genre mash up not the best combo and not well marketed. It's a SHARK MOVIE that turns into a PSYCHO-KILLER MOVIE.

If you see and like movies like SAW or HOSTEL, you might like SHARK NIGHT 3D.

Setting up the wrong expectations for this movie, was probably not a good idea. It's not a plot twist or a surprise when the movie takes a turn into the type of movie you would never go to see. Genre bending and mixing is one thing, but this was not so much a genre mash-up as it was a genre switch and not a welcome switch at all - at least for me.

It's not about the sharks, the sharks are incidental to the story's real plot. The movie starts out like a shark horror movie, then you realize the movie is about a pack of psycho-killers murdering for sport and profit. The movie starts out scary, then dives into the very creepy and disturbing.. Shark attacks of course are disturbing, but not the kind of psychologically disturbing sickness that psycho killers display- that's a whole other level of disturbing, including psychological torture. Isn't that what the director and some of the producers are known for? I didn't realize this movie was made by some of the same folks who made Hostel. I might have known then. Just looking at the poster though didn't clue me in.

Genre mash ups like Cowboys and Aliens, Pirates of the Caribbean, Sherlock Holmes or the upcoming John Carter are OK because all the genres included in the mash ups are genres you would go see separately. It's not good when one of the genres in your mash up is a genre most movie viewers would not go see, for what was meant as a surprise twist, becomes an appalling trick when the poster or trailer gives no clues to such a switch or mash up.

I'm not saying SHARK NIGHT is good or bad; I'm saying it turned into a type of movie I would normally never watch and in case you don't like the psycho-killer horror genre, you should be forewarned.

The shark genre loving fans won't think this is a shark movie and the psycho-killer/slasher horror genre fans don't know to go see it. Maybe word will get out so it can find it's target market.

What's more, the shark part of the story looses it's credibility along the way. The movie starts with one shark, then two, then you learn more than 40 species of sharks are in the lake, but never do you learn why all of them want to eat people-- or may be you do, but I didn't stay long enough to find out.

If the movie was paying homage to Jaws 3D, it got lost in the plot's turn toward the creepy.

I would have liked the movie, if it had stayed just a shark movie. I did like the beginning on the lake with the boats going through the Louisiana swampy channels and the boat race. The cast was good with familiar faces. Joel David Moore was killed off too soon. Best to keep your nerdy characters in longer, the audience will always root for them. Then if it had just gone on to explain why the sharks are so man-hungry and have the leads go on to rid the lake of some man-eating sharks (job too big for a couple of remaining character, alone)... It really didn't need the plot switch-aroo.
