Permalink",False,"Lindsay Lohan presented a different character approach where she played an amatory teen raised in California and sent to live with her pious grandmother for the sake of her redemption. This movie not only enhances the struggles between drinking and growing up too fast, but it shows the love in a family. This movie would play mind games with you which would inspire you to love each character. Felicity Huffman, played Lindsay Lohan's distressed mother and slowly throughout the movie it is seen how closely alike they are. Georgia Rule was a new take on movies and if you are in for a new turn of adventure and occasional comedy kicks, Georgia Rule is it.

Permalink",False,"This movie was a complete surprise! I had heard the worst reviews and when I watched it I was happily surprised. Love her or hate her Lindsey Lohan can act. I agree with others that say this movie was badly advertised. It is definitely not a light comedy, but deals with a real issue of sexual abuse. Lohan's acting makes the watcher laugh, cry, and ask yourself if she really just said that. She makes all those around her shine. I'm tired of the same old movies making it big on screen just because they are the stereotypical feel good comedies. This is finally an original movie with an original screenplay. If you are tired of copycat movies you should watch this one. Thumbs up!

Permalink",False,"Before watching the DVD of Georgia Rule last night, I knew nothing about the film other than it was savaged by critics and was a huge theatrical bomb. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was though, especially the acting from Lindsay Lohan. Her character in the film, as well as in real life, is one messed up young woman. Doing or saying whatever is needed at the time to get her through the situation, her character is very realistic and believable. I personally know a young woman with just these types of issues and reactions. Ms. Lohan's acting ability is phenomenal - and like other amazing, but difficult, actors, her off-screen antics never show up in the finished product. If she can straighten her life out, an Academy Award will be hers someday.

As always, it's wonderful seeing Jane Fonda back on the silver screen - and she looks superb! Too bad Mary Tyler Moore went crazy with the plastic surgery or she could (and should!) look this good now, too. Felicity Huffman is, as usual, stunning - her work is simply too good to ignore - hopefully, her and her husband, William H. Macy, will act together in the future. I'm surprised he wasn't involved in this project as a producer or something, like he was in Transamerica.

This film is difficult - it's a very, very serious film with deep, hard-to-watch issues going on. Yet, at the same time, Garry Marshall has tried to make it a light-hearted comedy too - it can't be both. From the looks of the finished product, I'd say a lot of the film ended up on the cutting room floor - too many scenes are simply not dealt with the way they should have been - like when Jane goes to buy the liquor - where's the struggle with the issue of what she is doing? Nowhere - instead we are treated to a, supposed, comical scene of her trying to hide the fact she's bought the liquor. Bizarre! It's like the film makers felt the movie had gotten too heavy at that point and needed some comic relief. Strange! The Mormon aspect was dealt with poorly too - the guy's issues with not having pre-marital sex rang false - an LDS (Mormon) church member, who was raised in the church, would know the reason why pre-marital sex is frowned upon, not just that it would ""make God mad."" The writer seems to know no more about the LDS religion and beliefs than some person told him - and he seemed to do no more in-depth research about it.

Still, don't let these complaints turn you off from seeing Georgia Rule. It's well worth your 2 hours."

Permalink",True,"When I saw this movie's trailer, I was not at all impressed by it. When I read the IMDb reviews, same was the case. The advertisements and marketing of this movie also seemed lackluster. Yet, I went to see the movie because in one of the reviews I read it was about ""child molestation"".

The movie is the story of three women  grandmother Georgia (Jane Fonda), daughter Lilly (Felicity Hoffman) and granddaughter Rachael (Lindsay Lohan). Seventeen years old Rachael has grown up to be a liar, loose character, rebel, ill-mannered etc. Lilly decides to leave Rachael with Georgia in one of the small towns of Idaho  hoping that Rachael will learn some good things from her grandmother. There are funny moments between religious Georgia and rebellious Rachael. Soon Rachael discloses that she was sexually molested by her stepfather Arnold (Cary Elwes), and this becomes the intrinsic turning point in the movie. Rachael keeps on changing her statements every now and then. Is Rachael telling the truth or lying? That forms the remaining story.

The character of Rachael was very puzzling to begin with. Being careless, sexually active, liar, outspoken, rebellious made us cringe to begin with. But as the story progressed, the character with such weirdness looked so real and acceptable.

All the actresses acted well  Jane Fonda, Felicity Hoffman but this very talented Lindsay Lohan captures the show - all in all. Hats off to Director Garry Marshall for bringing such a women's issue on the forefront and touch such a delicate topic out in the front fore.

The landscape of Idaho is capture miraculously. Some reviewer disagreed with the overly religious bent of Idaho people, but I think that does not matter  one need not take such small things to heart. It is just a story and as projecting as being non-religious is a non-issue, so projected being religious should be.

Overall, a welcome experience of an ""under-the-carpet"" subject  of child molestation  treated with not so much heaviness and darkness.

Permalink",False,"The rebel, reckless and spoiled teenager Rachel Wilcox (Lindsay Lohan) travels from San Francisco to the conservative Mormon Hull, Idaho, with her alcoholic mother Lily (Felicity Huffman) to spend the summer with her grandmother Georgia (Jane Fonda). Rachel and Lily have a troubled relationship and Georgia follows severe rules at her home. While with Georgia, Rachel reveals a traumatic secret from her past that explains her rebelliousness and brings her mother back to Idaho to check whether her daughter is telling the truth.

The screenplay of ""Georgia Rule"" is unusual, beginning with comedy but developing in a touching drama related to child abuse and relationship among three generations of the same family. The lead female characters are dysfunctional: Rachel lies, uses drugs and booze and behaves like a slut, with no sense of morality; her mother Lily is an alcoholic woman; and her grandmother Georgia does not express her love with her tough rules. The story is engaging, funny in many moments and heartbreaking in others, and shows the importance of the truth, no matter how painful it is, and family bonds to help to supersede problems and difficulties. The gorgeous Lindsay Lohan and Felicity Huffman are amazing, but Jane Fonda performs a strange but fair character. My vote is seven.

Permalink",False,"Once again Hollywood marketing has classified a heartfelt drama as a rip roaring comedy. Georgia Rule is no laughing matter, but it is a powerful, worthwhile movie with an outstanding cast. Forget all the critic's reviews -- they don't ""get it"".

The opening is a little slow but it accurately portrays the strained relationships and secrets in this family. Fonda and Huffman are brilliant and so is Lohan. Given the press surrounding Lohan during the filming, my expectations were pretty low and I was very surprised at how good she was and how good the movie was.

It's a great movie to open dialog with your Mom or your resident teenager. Take the R rating seriously - it's a mature chick flick - one of the best.

Garry Marshall did a good job at handling a heavy subject. There are a couple of laughs along the way for comedy relief, but this is a movie that will stay with you. Go see it.

Permalink",False,"Audiences can rebel and demand money back for numerous reasons. Viewers certainly do not like being misled by a trailer.

Georgia Rule is a prime example of an ill-marketed flick. Truth be told, I don't know how anyone could market the film. Is Georgia Rule without merit? Absolutely not! Is it a quirky comedy peopled by foreigners from California mixing with the quirky locals? Yes. Is it a slapstick comedy with clever comebacks? Yes. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM??? Quirky and clever comprise at the most 15 minutes of the film. Here is a serious drama about a family disintegrating because of communication problems and damaging behavior. Slowly the onion peels before the unsuspecting town (and the audience too). Long hidden problems drive squirm-inducing behavior on the part of the three female protagonists. The supporting cast, whether villains or heroes, perform wonders with roles better fleshed out than expected. The photography immerses watchers into small-town Idaho and its natural beauty. The score is unobtrusive - good. Now to the big stuff: · this script by Mark Andrus is another of his studies in deception, distrust, sex and revenge. None of these subjects is softened - the full impact of behaviors is up front and in-your-face but the characters seem real - these are not clichés. · I did not expect such a weighty film from Garry Marshall. He doesn't shy away from the material. He trusts his leads to get the job done. · And they deliver. Felicity Huffman walks a line as deftly as a tightrope walker. Her pain and confusion are very visible without being melodramatic or overwrought. Jane Fonda has a more difficult role - her Georgia barely reveals anything. Her every fiber tenses with control - you can almost hear her jaw clenching as she watches her daughter and granddaughter with disbelief. The surprise for me was Lindsay Lohan. A wise viewer would do well to set aside all the stories about her behavior during the making of this movie: what she delivered was simply amazing. Her character, Rachel, wears her demons on what few clothes surround her body. Miss Lohan's facial expressions veer wildly from vulnerability to defiance to dismay to anger and everything in between. The three ladies who carry Georgia Rule may fight it out come Oscar time. As for the film, I can't recommend it if only because of the subject matter."

I went into the cinema expecting a light, cliché, feel-good movie. What I saw was much more serious than expected. While it did have some humour, mostly it was a fairly hard-hitting look at the effects of child sexual abuse and the consequences of the abuse coming out into the open.

The performances in the movie were all pretty solid. Lohan really shone in this role. Early on in the movie, I thought it really seemed as though she was essentially playing herself, especially after hearing about her various antics off-screen. She really did well in this role.

My one gripe about Lohan was her age portrayal. It was hard to believe she was seventeen with a smoker's rasp and second-skin jeans. Fonda on the other hand... not her best work, she was completely generic. Huffman's performance was humorous, although a little dark. Her alcoholism is pretty believable except the antibuse thing. The movie was amusing and the unexpected plot twist kept me stringing along for the duration of the movie trying to figure it all out, but not in a frustrating way. Overall I think this movie was far better than expected and totally enjoyable.

Permalink",False,"I'm not sure why I decided to rent Georgia Rule, but I guess you could just color me intrigued since this is the film that I heard where Lindsay Lohan caused all that trouble on being late constantly or not showing up on set. I really had no idea what this movie was about, but I watched it last night expecting probably an over the top chick flick, but actually it wasn't bad. Over all I would say that the story was very good and the actors did a good job, I mean say what you want about Lindsay, she is a good actress you have to admit. The only thing I was a bit disappointed with was the ending, but I'm not going to give that away, it's something you'll just have to see for yourselves. But the rest of the story was really good, funny at times, and very touching.

Rachel is a young trouble maker from California coming to Idaho to see her grandmother, Georgia, and stay with her for the summer. Rachel already stirs up quite a bit of trouble around the town when she messes around with a Christian boy, she makes the moves on a widowed man, and the fact that she is very blunt about things. But things take a different turn when she tells Simon, the widower and her boss, that she was molested by her step dad. He tells Georgia and Georgia calls her daughter, Rachel's alcoholic mother, Lily, comes to find out if that's the truth or not, Rachel for once doesn't wanna cause trouble and tells her mom it's all a lie. Georgia won't tolerate this though, she knows there's something wrong and has to let Rachel know that there are people there who love her and remind her the difference between right and wrong.

The story was really good I think, some of the characters could have used a little more developing, but it still worked. Was it a chick flick? Oh, yeah. But I think this is one of those rare one's that I don't mind. The girls did a great job on acting, so did Dermot Mulroney who played Simon. The ending was just a bit flat and I felt like there could have been a better conclusion, but you'll see if you watch it. But I would recommend it if you are just looking for a fun little flick for the afternoon. Georgia Rule is a good movie that will make you laugh and will touch your heart.

Permalink",True,"I suppose ultimately my expectations weren't high going into Georgia Rule considering the lack luster reviews by critics and the ongoing poor press of it's young star Lindsay Lohan but I forgot one key element...the director. Garry Marshall is brilliant!! He has done some of the most entertaining films in history including my personal favorite The Princess Diaries, as well as Pretty Woman, Beaches and a host of absolutely classic Television shows. Marshall has a way of capturing reality, he has a way of making us fall in love with his characters and be riveted by their lives and what happens to them. He just makes his films come alive and Georgia Rule is no exception to Marshall's rule. The film is a little more gritty and dark, perhaps a little more adult than what Marshall usually delves into but that being said it still has it's charm, it still has a dark, twisted humor to it and it still has Hector Elizondo (who Marshall likes to cameo or feature in his films.) The cast is brought together very well and everyone works well together in it and you love being a part of the daily routine of the small town. There is enough drama, emotion, comedy, and overall scenes of pure joy to make this a good movie.

I'll start with Jane Fonda. As famous as she is this is only the second movie I've ever seen her in...the first was Monster-In-Law and I became an instant fan of hers. Her comic timing, her character and her performance was downright brilliant. In this turn she is Georgia, a firm and dedicated woman who lives on her own and but is well known to the townspeople. She has a set way to do things and no one is going to tell her otherwise. Georgia is terrific...the perfect match for Fonda and does a great job. Fonda is such a talented actress and Hollywood elite and she lights up the screen and yet still comes across as this down home, lovable character. My only complaint is that she wasn't used more in the film than she was. Felicity Huffman, I became a big fan of after watching the brilliant film Transamerica where she played a man wanting to go through the transformation into a woman...her performance was amazing. In Georgia Rule she plays the daughter of Jane Fonda's Georgia, Lilly. Now Lilly hasn't always appreciated her mother's firm nature and has had a rough go of it battling alcoholism, two marriages and her wild and uncontrollable daughter. Huffman isn't the forefront of the story but she adds a lot of emotion to her role. Her battle with alcoholism and her daughter and her estranged second husband give way to some very powerful moments. She is a great actress. And now we tread lightly into the world of the recently arrested Miss Lindsay Lohan. We all heard she was nearly fired from this film for her wild ways and I mean her role in this film must strike so close to home it hurts. As Rachel, Lohan plays a confused and messed up post high school graduate who likes her recreational drugs, drinking and random sexual encounters. She doesn't want to listen to so called 'authority figures' and thinks her life is just fine but she's hiding a devastating secret. Lohan I thought overall was good...she didn't match the performances of her senior performers but to go up against Jane Fonda is pretty impressive. She has some great lines and she definitely pulls off the firecracker role very well. Also on the plus side she looks relatively healthy considering her real life health issues as of late. Dermot Mulroney is also very good and actually shows some life to his usually rather dull performances as local Doctor/Veterinarian Simon. Simon becomes almost like a father figure to Rachel and is the one to really bring her back around to coming to terms with herself and her issues. Mulroney is a good addition to the cast. Cary Elwes rounds out the cast as Rachel's stepfather and Garrett Hedlund as her love interest. Elwes is appropriately normal looking but still becomes the villain in a different way and you want to see him get his just end. Hedlund is okay as the naive and love struck Harlan. He comes across as a bit of a dolt which is okay but ultimately you don't want the main romantic interest to be downright stupid. Naive is one thing.

Despite it's serious content (the film is about sexual abuse and coming-of-age in a different sort of way...something director Garry Marshall does with style always) the film has some genuinely funny moments. I wouldn't hesitate to see this film again because there was something charming about it and ultimately it did have it's happy ending although my one big complaint is that Cary Elwes' character never truly gets what's coming to him. I wanted to see Lohan take her aggressions out on him. However the scene with Jane Fonda's Georgia hitting him with the bat is priceless. This film is a classic I think and will go far despite critics and dollar signs. See it!! You'll enjoy it!! 8.5/10

Permalink",True,"I am not sure the best way to describe my feelings about this movie. Truthfully I only watched it because I like Lindsay Lohan, (The Parent Trap got me hooked) but it was better than I had expected. There were a lot of parts in the movie that made me ask myself ""Did she really just say that? Or did that really happen?"". If it had just been a typical chick flick that didn't say or do anything bad I think it would have sucked. The plot was okay, but the ending left me wanting more closure. It had a ""Happy"" ending but I wanted to know what happened to the Step-dad, if Rachel actually had a tape, if her and the boy got together. There were a lot of unanswered questions without obvious answers. Over all I thought it was a pretty good movie I laughed a lot and would definitely rent it when it came out on DVD. I don't know if I would recommend paying the money to watch it in the theater, unless you love Lindsay like I do.

Permalink",True,"Sadly, most audiences are probably giving this film a negative reception, though it is one of the most assured pieces of this year. Jane Fonda is back, with her stoic, nonsensical acting, lending gravitas to the piece. That should be enough warning that the piece is not going to be a silly comedy, but a piece dealing with darker and forbidding issues.

To begin with, every behavior has a source, and the rather impulsive, self-destructive defense mechanisms of the Lohan character have a horrible beginning. She alledges some misconduct on the side of a male relative, and this sets off a series of storms that eventually lead to a satisfying conclusion. The frustrating part of the movie is not that anyone is bad, but that much more can be expected from all the participants. Jane Fonda does light supporting work as the skeptical grandmother than is afraid to lose her footing by changing routines. She is perspective but ineffective when providing solace. In fact, she messed up raising her own daughter, now a victim of her own demons and facing a new tragedy, with her daughter's own crisis.

Marshall does well with the darker themes, and he has cast the film beautifully, with Lindsay Lohan proving she is a girl fully able to show the many facets of a troubled character. She is also funny (in a defensive way), sympathetic, and never a true victim. She shows the strength that skipped a generation in her family and reluctantly accepts her grandmother's approach to life.

""Georgia Rule"" suffers not from its material but Hollywood's silly approach in marketing a film that should have been treated with more respect.

Permalink",True,"I'm only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile. I love to praise a great movie and I'm not biased toward ""male"" movies. Legally blonde was an excellent film. Georgia Rule on the other hand, was a disorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of movie making at its worst. by the end of the film I didn't care who was lying or if anything was resolved.

The most important thing in a film is a good STORY. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject matter is deep, doesn't mean the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change, and is primed for that change over the course of the movie. In Georgia Rule, the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly, there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time (you've only got a couple hours in a movie). That means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the poorly written story, and the litter of weak dynamic characters, I can't even say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. That's fine if your're writing American Beauty but not when you're attempting a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (no I'm not cutting her any slack because she was molested, crap happens to everyone and we're all responsible for our own actions). The ""Dudley Do Right"" Mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments...and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl who's been molested just stay over occasionally (unless he's an actor or a politician). This movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself what good movie making is NOT!

Permalink",False,"Three generations of headstrong women struggle to get along in this misfired comedy-drama from director Garry Marshall and screenwriter Mark Andrus. It is easily one of worst-written motion pictures in years. Opening with an unbelievable scene of mother-daughter conflict on the open highway, rebellious teenager Lindsay Lohan goes to sleep on the side of the road, is awakened by a Mormon hunk who inadvertently feels her up (thinking she's dead), and ends up hitching a ride into town with a veterinarian whom the girl decides must be gay because he didn't look at her exposed legs once. Lohan then runs into the hunk again, who thoughtfully figures she must be more dangerous than riding a horse. ""Yeah,"" she tells him, ""But at least after riding me, you don't have to wipe your shoes off."" Shifting the tone midway into family soap opera, Marshall grinds the gears for emotional impact, however since no connection has been made between these characters and living, breathing human beings, the gambit fails to pay off. It is inconceivable that an actress of Jane Fonda's stature would end up in such a contrived, phony scenario--and it's painful to watch her trying to make something meaningful out of this abysmal material when the basic ingredients just aren't there. Lohan, playing an habitual liar and loudmouth, wears provocative clothes and sizes all the men up with a jaded, cynical stare, but her hard quality puts a wall up between she and the audience; we're not drawn to her, and less of her is more. A dynamic actress such as Drew Barrymore in her teenage years might have been able to pull this role off, but Lohan isn't in that league. * from ****"

The three women were all such good actresses--they showed their emotions subtly and each of their characters was so believable. I don't see how the movie could have been any better. That said, I do think it would be most popular with people old enough to have dealt with a teenage daughter. I went with a college student, though, and she liked it.

I think when something is pushed as hard as this was there is a reason. Aside from the fact that the acting was mediocre with the exception of Lindsay Lohan, who was dreadful, the story was pretty ho hum. I have no particular in Lohan's private life since she is a child to someone of my age, but to misquote an oldie but goldie, ""her acting ran the gamut from A to B"". I felt no connection to any of the women in the film. They seemed completely detached from any real emotion. The men fared just as poorly. I would certainly not recommend this to anyone even as a rental when it becomes available. Basically the film lacked heart and depth.

Permalink",False,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.

A surprise to say the least. The movie trailer for this movie were totally misleading. The company should be fined for the advertising for this film. It will attract the wrong audience. This is NOT for kids. Rated R but many will want to see Linday Lohan with their parents. Not a good idea. Lindsay, Ms. Jane Fonda, and Felicity Huffman are wonderful in this very poignant and said tale of the relationship of mother and daughter and granddaughter.

The R rating is what spoils it for the kids. Quite frankly, we didn't feel that the R rated parts were needed for this excellent film.

If Ms. Lohan can get her real life together, she is a fine actress. And it was wonderful to see Jane Fonda.. as good as ever and Felicity Huffman gave an equally wonderful performance.

Go and see and leave the kids home."

Permalink",False,"It is not that is a bad film, it is just that the whole story is hollow. You've seen it before: strong women, usually belonging yo the same family, having weird yet mostly amusing quirks, entertain the audience with their sparkly and refreshing relationship. Male characters are just for decoration, cardboard clichés with nothing better to do than either fall in love with the complicated women, either being total jerks.

Women might enjoy this movie more than I did, but it is hardly average. There are some good jokes and there is decent acting in it. The script wanted to be something like an onion being peeled away, showing layer upon layer of familial complexity, but they either run out of imagination or out of money by the end of the first half.

Permalink",False,"I have to say that I was really disappointed when I went to start writing a review for this film. According to the page for this film the location shooting never got out of the state of California. I really did think that they actually shot this film in Idaho. I guess in a sense I have to tip my hat to the location managers and set designers for what they did.

That being said the film is about three generations of females in one family. Mom, Felicity Huffman, is having all kinds of behavioral problems with daughter Lindsay Lohan growing up in worldly San Francisco. So she's shipping her off to Hull, Idaho to stay with her grandmother, Jane Fonda.

Fonda's an old hand at dealing with rebellious kids as Felicity was and is quite the wild child in her day. Of course all three generations come to an agonizing reappraisal of their situation and in that fateful summer they get to know each other better.

Life does imitate art because the film is now getting reams of publicity due to Lindsay Lohan's behavioral problems in real life. And of course Jane Fonda back in the day was no stranger to being a rebellious individual. She still has a few detractors, me included, for visiting and broadcasting from a country we were at war with. Still you can't deny the talent gene.

In Georgia Rule's favor also is that it does sort of put a lie to that old line about there being no women's roles written these days. The female players definitely have center stage here.

There are three substantial male roles that are filled nicely, Dermot Mulroney as the town veterinarian and Huffman's former sweetheart, Cary Elwes as Huffman's sleazy husband and Lohan's stepfather and Garrett Hedlund as the young Mormon kid Lohan first seduces then falls for. In many ways Hedlund has the most interesting part in the film.

Best scene for me, Lohan's confrontation with the girlfriends of Hedlund's former girlfriend. Has to be seen and I have no doubt she would have carried out her 'threat' to them.

It's a good film, it has both it's serious and comic moments nicely blended."

Permalink",True,"Well, it was entertaining enough, but...

This movie was marketed as a comedy, which is totally inaccurate since there are surprisingly few ""funny"" moments. For some people probably none at all.

It was not the light-hearted comedy I thought it was going to be. It's quite a serious movie that deals with serious issues.

Lindsay Lohan did a fine job... portraying her real-life self. She was so convincing as a spoiled stuck-up party girl because she didn't have to act.

Also, there was zero chemistry between characters and you could actually tell that they can't stand / couldn't care less for each other. None of them seem to have bothered to ""own"" their respective roles; instead, they just showed up and did their jobs -- that's the vibe you get from this movie.

Nevertheless, it's quite an O.K. movie -- for those interested in this genre (drama).

Permalink",True,"I don't see how people can knock this film, It is dealing with a very difficult topic, sexual abuse and this film deals with it in a fantastic way, it isn't over dramatised as it is in so many other films that touch on the topic. The film portrays a rebellious teenager, but the audience learns quickly that this movie is about more than just that.It is about each character growing and learning to forgive and to move on. I adore this film and would have to say that I think this is Lindsay at her best, she is not playing a little girl anymore, In this film she is playing an adult and doesn't rely on her slutty looks to get her by, this is a fine example of how well she really can act. A great cast and a good film. Just give the film a chance and I am sure you will not be disappointed.

Permalink",True,"Georgia Rule has got to be one of - if not the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp, ""what?"" out loud at least 7-10 times throughout its grueling two hour course.

Advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as the matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter, and Lindsay Lohan as the rebellious, over- sexed, scantily clad grand-daughter, the viewer thinks this will be a cliché, light, chick-flick about growing up and coming together as a family.

Talk about false advertisement at it worst.

After many shots of animals doing ""funny"" things in the background of ""pivotal"" scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctor's office weekly to have her diaper changed, or the fact that this movie is actually about Lindsay Lohan's character being sexually abused by her step-father, Georgia Rule creates its own genre of cinema : The ungrounded, horribly acted, inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward, surreal, strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama/comedy, then he should have watched The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug. And so on. And so on.

The only way I feel I can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that Georgia Rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation. Say that the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child. But instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn, belly laughs and comedy would ensue, with all of the characters' reactions being that of fake, lifeless, human beings pretending to care.

Throw in a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the flattest, most non-dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script, along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy, too-tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he, as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene, unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other, and you've got Georgia Rule.

I found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc..who have a lot more talent and aren't getting noticed.

Don't see this movie : my rule.

And if you must, get sufficiently drunk before hand.

I was expecting the movie to be about a ""mean girl"" getting put in her place by her granny. What you find is a girl who is deeply troubled not because she is bored, fabulous and rich. Lohans character reminds me of people I know who have gone thru similar situations, in a word it's just real. I was very blown away by Linsey Lohan's acting. She has stepped beyond her traditional ""bratty"" role. This role needed good character acting. And she pulled thru.

The only warning is that this is not a movie that her traditional fan base would enjoy. As I said earlier this movie deals with some troubling situations. Keep the kids home.

Permalink",True,"I was blown away by this movie. It was intense, moving, and remarkably well acted.

This is NOT the movie I expected from its previews, though. It is funny, there are comical moments with Lindsay Lohan's California character coming to Idaho--but what this movie is really about is the impact her stepfather's incest has on Rachel's life and relationships.

Anyone who has ever dealt with this or a similar issue in real life will find this movie to be remarkably true. Yes, the ending is somewhat Hollywood happier than real life my be--but not in the way you might expect, and not without an understanding of many of the difficult underlying realities.

Lindsay Lohan's performance in this movie blew me away. I left the theater today thinking Oscar for her. I like Lindsay Lohan, but I don't remember thinking before this that she deserved an Academy Award.

Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman also bring powerful performances to this movie. And Lindsay--wow--thank you for an amazing, courageous performance. Yes, the character of Rachel is cute and sexy and spunky and rebellious, but Lindsay also makes her real, and shows the powerful connection between the interweaving of her character's personality and her struggle to cope with an impossible problem.

There is one moment, about halfway through the movie, when there is a moving confrontation between Jane Fonda's character and Lindsay Lohan's. The entire success of this movie hinges on Lindsay's performance in that moment. If she hadn't hit it perfectly, the movie would not work.

She was perfect. And it was all, simply, just in the look in her eyes.

This is an amazing movie, worth seeing more than once and deserving of far more serious consideration than it is currently getting. But it is not the movie you think you will see after watching the previews.

Besides my wife's insistence, I was persuaded to attend the opening today by the presence of Garry Marshall in the project. Turns out I was delightfully surprised. All three female leads were exceptionally well cast and acted together superbly. They represented the three generations perfectly.

This is billed as a Comedy/Drama and that it is. The comedy was better than most and the drama built up as the characters' true selves and their strengths and weaknesses evolved. This is by far the best of its genre to come in a long time. Don't miss it!

Alcoholism and sexual abuse are uneasy subjects to tackle. Georgia Rules offers the viewer more than just a glimpse into these issues. The film provides strong characters who work their way through their demons with spirit and humanity. Dermot Mulroney does fine work, as the Idahoan doctor/veterinarian, who helps Lohan ""find her way home."" Huffman is truly touching as a mother torn between truth and lies. Fonda is especially wonderful. Her strength as an actress is something rare these days. She truly gels the film into worthwhile cinema. I hope she many more worthwhile roles ahead of her.

Permalink",False,"Where to start? Such a huge disappointment. Gary Marshal is ""B"" list. There are so many holes in this story. Let's start with the lack of foundation laid for any of the relationships, i.e. Simon and Rachel. Ridiculous. With the serious matter of sexual abuse, I found it disrespectful, if not insulting, to witness how poorly the story was set around this tender issue. Although Lohan's performance was marginal, she had little to work with considering such poor quality writing. The lines left little for any actor to work with. Huffman was bearable. The only reason there was to stay and finish this movie was Fonda. I expected this powerhouse actress/woman to go overboard. She was not only beautiful to look at, she pulled off this role with class, grace, talent and poise. It seems to be commonplace that when a seasoned actress is given a role such as this, the anger element is so overplayed that eyes roll. Examples are Shirley McLaine in ""Rumor Has It"". Fonda kept it real. She is the sole reason this movie moved along at all.

Permalink",True,"You won't like this; hardly anyone does. I didn't.

But it does have some engaging qualities. The first is of course that it is an interesting disaster. Marshall is near the end of his life. He's bright enough to know he has done nothing in film that matters, and he's on record as saying that he would like to. What he knows how to do is weave pathos and comedy, so instead of serving up the same old formula he tries pushing the envelope. He pushed it past his audience and so will sell few tickets. but its a noble effort. Its the kind of failure I applaud.

Its part ""Doc Holiday,"" romantic comedy, part ""Flirting with Disaster,"" (also comedic but more episodically) and with heavy matter.

One reason it didn't work is that the audience doesn't see the groove here, the lightness of darkness. More interesting to me is what I think is a more fundamental failure to connect, the narrative dimension. If you haven't seen this, the narrative follows the Lohan character. What we know, we discover through or from her. She is our on-screen connection to discovery.

The narrative device here is that she tells a character something which we wonder about. Is it true? She's already been well established as a manipulative liar, quite capable of such a thing. Then before the movie is over, we have gone through three major reversals of whether it is true, each shift convincing. Yes, its hard to appreciate deftness and risk in a bad movie, one that even if successful would masquerade as trivial. But the risk is appreciated.

So if you get trapped seeing this, relax into the notion that life is all about whose eyes you can accommodate, and what it means to trust those eyes. Its a far deeper question and more intimate than matters of family. And if you do settle into it, you'll appreciate some small decisions: the redheaded music teacher, the freckle painstakingly painted over the lipstick, the exposure of that first experience in an open boat.

Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

Permalink",False,"I am so sick of people judging Lindsay Lohan for what she chooses to do in her personal life. She is not the Disney Darling we all first met, and this movie certainly shows us that she is capable of much more.

Georgia Rule is a movie that takes a controversial subject and comes at you with it. The script is riveting, the acting top notch, and the cinematography is wonderful. The problem with this movie was the publicity and the marketing. First off you have people walking in prejudiced because of Lindsay Lohan's partying and Jane Fonda's politics, or people who choose not to see this movie because of that. Then you have the previews that make you think this movie is a light hearted comedy, which it is not. Georgia Rule is a drama, and it was not portrayed as such. There are some great comedic bits in the movie, but majority of the story revolves around whether or not Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) was raped by her stepfather for two years starting when she was 12, or if she is simply lying to get attention. Hence why this movie will shock you.

I believe that if people weren't so ignorant and could put their opinions aside before seeing this movie, you will enjoy it. It is not perfect, rarely any movie is, but it has some great qualities. Felicity Huffman is just amazing, with her portrayal as the struggling alcoholic mother who finds out that her marriage and the man she has loved and trusted is a fraud. Lindsay Lohan was surprising in this movie. She makes you feel the pain and the agony her character is going through with this secret one minute, and the next she is making you angry because she has chosen to lie or hurt someone rather than let her guard down. These two actresses make the movie. Jane Fonda was good, but nothing too stellar from the actress whose character's name is in the movie title. She is believable as the strict, over-bearing mother, but she does little to really grab the audience. The male supporting cast, Dermot Mulroney, Cary Elwes, and the surprising Garret Hedlund were magnificent. Hedlund was a big surprise and his character was every bit the lovable guy. My only wish is that they developed Mulroney and Huffman's characters' past a little more than just a glimpse of what they once shared.

The script was great, and the characters were so deep. This movie was not a Garry Marshall picture, and that threw people off. It is a lot heavier than his usual fare, and was advertised as something it was not maybe to attract his usual crowd. Remember this movie is rater R, not Marshall's usual PG choices, and the subject matter is quite shocking. Ignore the critics, give this movie a chance and it may surprise you."

It is a very surprising movie, and in a way keeps you guessing the entire time. Wonderful dynamics and great dialogue. Stellar performance by Huffman. Lohan and Fonda were also both quite good.

Permalink",False,"I originally saw this because I felt like watching a cheesy bad movie. This film, of course, is marketed as a family comedy where a stereotypically rebellious ""bad"" girl gets put in her place by her stereotypically strong-willed grandma.

I sure was surprised when this turned out to be a rather serious drama about sexual abuse. The main theme is the question of whether or not the apparently untrustworthy girl's claims are true, or just a plea for attention, and how it is nearly impossible for anyone to know whether to trust her. It was actually fairly interesting, and thematically similar to Doubt.

I am very confused about the angle the advertisers took in promoting this film. It seems to me like the people who would actually be interested in this movie are exactly the ones who won't see it, because it has been marketed as a generic mindless comedy.

Permalink",True,"It truly is. For, while it has been hammered by the ""professional"" critics, and overshadowed by the scandals surrounding Lohan's personal life, Georgia Rule is a decent flick. A hell of a lot better than that Spiderman smut that everyone is going to. I'll admit that the dialogue was, at times, random and the flow of the events in the film was a little less than smooth, but I believe that the performances and the overall story line made up for the few small flaws.

I think Lohan did a seamless job of portraying a girl, who has always had to be the adult when it came to her and her mother, and had to carry a psychosis damaging secret. Huffman's take on the tragic hysteria that one would be driven to when trying to decide which loved one is lying to you, whether your daughter is lying about the pervertedness of your husband, or whether your husband is lying about the moral structure of your daughter, was a thing of beauty. Fonda was really the only performance I had an issue, but she didn't provide the very important role of comic relief.

All in all, the plot was original and tackled a heavy subject, with the right amount of comedy.

Permalink",False,"I was expecting some light entertainment; a relaxing outing after a busy week at work. I sat back and relaxed and soon into this film felt like I was sucker punched by a thug. Whoa! Talk about having almost no connection with the film's advertising... this is the poster child.

After recovering from the shocking revelations from Lohan's character it was a see-saw plot that kept you guessing. Garry Marshall did a wonderful job in the performances he elicited from the cast, especially Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan. I never would have guessed that Lohan would have such actual talent. The very real emotion she displayed will doubtless have some guessing if there is some of her own real life victimization in here. I certainly hope not, as the character's history is deeply ugly and all too familiar to me. I really felt I knew her here, and felt her experiences, her pain and helplessness. Some of the dialog I've said myself in real life.

The next treat was Ms. Huffman, albeit a much less sympathetic character. But her performance was stunningly real.

The rest of the cast did their jobs well enough, but the clear centerpiece here is Lohan as the victim fighting a world that has wronged her greatly. I would not object to her being nominated for an academy award for this... even winning. I was that moved.

The other usual trappings of the film business were all well done. It did not look like Idaho to me, more like some parts of Southern California, but all of that takes a back seat to the story here. It is a shame that more people will not go see this movie because they have no idea what it is really about.

Thanks Mr. Marshall, for a great film on a despicable subject."

Permalink",False,"I am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy. Attempting to be a new millennium cross-hybrid between On Golden Pond and The Prince of Tides, this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off. The main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between Garry Marshall's sentimental direction and Mark Andrus' dark, rather confusing screenplay. The story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother Lilly and daughter Rachel, who have driven all the way from San Francisco to small-town Hull, Idaho where grandmother Georgia lives. The idea is for Lilly to leave Rachel for the summer under Georgia's taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17-year old has become an incorrigible hellion.

The set-up is clear enough, but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline. It veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism, child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution. The three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees. Probably due to her off-screen reputation and her scratchy smoker's voice, Lindsay Lohan makes Rachel's promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable, although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior. Felicity Huffman is forced to play Lilly on two strident notes - as a petulant, resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry, alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughter's state of mind. She does what she can with the role on both fronts, but her efforts never add up to a flesh-and-blood human being.

At close to seventy, Jane Fonda looks great, even as weather-beaten as she is here, and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon-like dimensions of the flinty Georgia. The problem I have with Fonda's casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one-liners and maternal stares. Between this and 2005's execrable Monster-in-Law, it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her. It should come as no surprise that the actresses' male counterparts are completely overshadowed. Garrett Hedlund looks a little too surfer-dude as the naïve Harlan, a devout Mormon whose sudden love for Rachel could delay his two-year missionary stint. Cary Elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as Lilly's husband, an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movie's ending.

There is also the omnipresent Dermot Mulroney in the morose triple-play role of the wounded widower, Lilly's former flame and Rachel's new boss as town veterinarian Dr. Simon Ward. Laurie Metcalf has a barely-there role as Simon's sister Paula, while Marshall regular Hector Elizondo and songsmith Paul Williams show up in cameos. Some of Andrus' dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right. There are several small extras with the 2007 DVD, none all too exciting. Marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor. There are several deleted scenes, including three variations on the ending, and a gag reel. A seven-minute making-of featurette is included, as well as the original theatrical trailer, a six-minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five-minute tribute to Marshall."

Permalink",False,"I just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what others thought of it. I'm left wondering if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same film! This is potentially a very good story, but it fails to hit the mark. The script is very weak - the plot has so many holes that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that I found myself asking the question ""How did we get here?"" at least a half dozen times during the movie.

There was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's antics during the filming. It was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job, but didn't commit to their roles.

This is not a movie worth seeing...go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that's worth it!

Marketing is a key part to any good film, especially one that does not originate from a novel or previous story line. therefore it is not bad marketing but like the movie itself a twist, a lie and the truth. there where comedic bits in there. not all films are what you expect. neither are all books. simply you wouldn't judge a book by its cover, why judge a movie by its trailer?

Permalink",True,"The under reporting of child neglect, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse is a serious issue. When a major director, well known actors, and a screen play draw attention to this subject, a public service is performed.

In a 20 year social work career, I served 2 years in Child protective services in a major U. S. city. Reports to CPS came in on a daily basis, to which only a percentage received a response, some times 20% sometimes 90%; seldom, if ever, 100%.

The potential and actual tragedy in many lives cannot be calculated until a high-profile story, e.g. Columbine or Virgina Tech becomes headline news.

If this film draws even minor attention, leading to more efforts to a solution of this widespread and pervasive problem, regardless of the dramatic value of the film, we will all be winners.

Permalink",False,"The buzz 'Georgia Rule' garnered from its production was enough to make any individual to drop in to the cinema to find out the outcome of Lindsay Lohan's lack of proffesionalism. However with Garry Marshall directing, one can be assured that his sugar coatings do wonders for films and this is no exception.

The performances were phenomenal- over here we have 3 mainstream actresses. Jane Fonda who looks stunning for her age, plays Grandma Georgia, a rule maker who burdens any visitor in her house with her 'Georgia rules.' For comic relied Jane Fonda nails the part of Georgia, and we see an icon in the film industry mellowing herself down to cooler roles - heck she ain't trying to win an Oscar now..?!!? Then there's Felicity Huffman, who proved she can still kick ass on the big screen as much as she could on TV. As Lilly, Huffman's portrayal of a slumping alcoholic, was touching and was a departure from her usual roles. Finally the spotlight of the movie - Lindsay Lohan who unequivocally gave the best performance. This is definitely her most mature role, and she will shock audiences as no one has seen her this grown up. Transcending and unforgettable, Lohan definitely takes the cake as Rachel.

The trailer was misleading, and what I expected was Lindsay to be playing another character too much like her ownself - however this movie surfaced the morals of family and trust. Yet another stunner by Marshall."

Permalink",False,"I would just like to say that I thought this film is wonderful, despite the fact that it brings up bad memories. While I can say my experience was not as bad as some of the experiences I have heard others have experienced, I would like to say that to truly understand this film and the actions taken by the character portrayed by Lindsay Lohan, you would have had to have been molested and/or sexually assaulted yourself. The star character in this story had a negative sexual experience with someone she should have been able to trust. Due to the fact that her experience with sex was negative, her future relationships (sexual in nature or not), have forever been altered. Now, therapy and future positive experiences can change the outcome for the star character...but they can never, NEVER take back what she lost when she was victimized by her step father. If you have not experienced what the character went through, you can't really understand the entire gist of the film. The main point of the store is despite what the women in the story have gone through, they haven't let it completely change the fact that they can still get what they want and enjoy a life that they can carve for themselves.

But special kudos to the screenwriter for authenticity.

The character Rachel behaved EXACTLY as you should expect a young woman who had been sexually abused as a child by a father or a father-figure to act.

Rebelliousness and lying, drug abuse, promiscuousness, cynicism, using sex as way to show affection and control, the need to be just loved by a man without sex ... all fit the profile. (I am a psychologist)

Note to moms: If your daughter is like Rachel, pay attention! It's far more common than you can imagine.

Beyond that, Rachel's mom's reaction is also typical ... if not a bit too insightful. The desire to keep the family intact, to believe her man, to think that he would never do something so horrible ... coupled with a ""bad daughter"" may induce her to take the side of the accused."

Permalink",True,"The problem with family dramas is that, outside of TV movies on channels like Lifetime, most people don't want to watch them. And the ones that do get watched tend to be sensationalized and about current or topical problems or issues in the news (or recent news). Movies that explain or explore the human condition aren't popular. Particularly with the young crowd that would be Miss Lohan's fan base or the younger crowd that tends to make movies not simply popular but financially successful for studios.

The specific problems I had with this movie is the cartoonishness of some of the characterizations. It was a bit much to blame all of the Lohan's character's acting-out (wrecking the car, drug use, etc.) on what her step-father did to her. While not improbable,it's just a bit much to expect the audience to swallow. Additionally, other aspects, such as her giving the young Morman boy, oral sex, or that she would actually make a good assistant to the vet, who coincidentally happens to have a thing for her mother, etc., all these elements just did not really help this movie along. It placed it more in the element of a situation comedy trying one of their ""special dramatic episodes"" then it did for a fully realized, well-written feature film.

When you watch the DVD and listen to the commentary, particularly for the various alternate endings, you can really see all of this is sharp focus.

Permalink",False,"How, I struggle for my craft! Besides being the only male in the theater for this one, I'm sure that I was about half the median age (never thought I'd ever use that Math term in normal conversation) of the other viewers. Still can't complain, I guess. I got phone numbers. Okay, enough with the jokes! The movie is a pretty solid drama that kinda plays like Pleasantville meets Fried Green Tomatoes. I believe that this is the movie that required Ms. Lohan to receive a letter reminding her to show up on time for work and not suffering from the latent effects of alcohol poisoning. The letter was leaked (surprise, surprise) and smeared Lindsay's already tarnished public image. That's a shame, because she does a very good job playing a spoiled, sexually aggressive, and very confused, teenager. How hard of an acting job was that for her? OK, OK, now, I'm done with the jokes! She holds her own alongside far more seasoned performers. Mulroney, Elwes and Fonda are very good, while Huffman and Hedlund struggled to keep up with the fast company here. The story is good and not as predictable as these films usually are.

Lindsay Lohan is Rachael, a temperamental, rich LA teenager sent by her struggling mother (Huffman) to a primarily Mormon town to stay with her estranged and rigid grandmother/drill sergeant, Georgia, played by Fonda. The interplay between these two personalities would be a story in itself, and that is actually what I had expected. Instead, there are all kinds of family and personal issues for Rachael to figure out and one big question that everyone needs settled. Plus, all these darn men just keep getting in the way. There is actually too much story here and forces director, Marshall to come to quick and superficial solutions, even compared to other dramas of this type. I guess it was either that or turn it into a trilogy and we all know how much Hollywood hates to do that.

Drama fans and bonding women looking to share popcorn and a tissue will enjoy this one (though you will probably not need the tissue), while most men would probably rather wait in the car.

Her character obviously isn't much of a stretch from her real life shenanigans that have been exploited by the tabloids. One can definitely tell from watching the film that Lohan without question brings a piece of her personal life into the role resulting into a stellar performance. The screenplay was well written and the film itself was just an old fashioned good movie done with a low budget. No bells or whistles needed. Even though some may tag this story as a chick flick it definitely holds it own as it appeals to everyone in the audience. All of the characters were very believable and delivered a satisfactory performance. Even Fonda who I've read mixed reviews delivers a decent performance.

Permalink",True,"Director Gary Marshall tries to treat serious family issues with a touch. For the most part he succeeds, though the problem is keeping interest during the early parts of the film. The last 40 minutes of the film do the pulling in of the audience.

This film highlights 3 women, Grandmom (Jane Fonda)who is Georgia and her rule is pretty obvious. Mom (Felicity Huffman) who is into a second marriage with a second husband who she is in denial about because she drinks to avoid facing serious issues with him.

Then we have Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) who is in serious need of help because she is trying to run away from mom because of the abuse she has gotten from step dad. This leads to Grandmoms house where she initially keeps up her rebellion but then shifts into eventually liking Grand mom and enlisting her to help confront her mom with step dads problem.

It does not become clear what is happening until later in the film because the story is developed slowly. All the women have issues and confront issues with everyone else in their lives. In the end, they all find each other.

This is a good warm touchy film. Marshall has a deft touch of dealing with a very serious adult issue & the restrained performance of Fonda & great performances by Lohan & Huffman bring it off very well.

The reason I never snagged it before is because of the reviews, although not horrid, weren't promising either. None of the reviewers whom I respect crushed the film but they didn't seem to like the way the last act happened, the cliché' happy ending but I didn't see any real happy conclusion. In the end, the daughter goes to hug the mom, yes, but their problems are FAR from over. The mom is still an alcoholic, the daughter, a 17 year old, hasn't trusted anyone since being twelve and has had no therapy. This is a ""hopeful ending"" which is what it should be. Anyway, I have to say I love when I think something is going to suck and it doesn't. That was the case here. I found this interesting and true to form. I've known girls like Rachel. Girls who are beautiful but had things happen to them in their past that screw them up in their later lives. They acted a lot like this but thats not all. I like the way the story doesn't really know where to go in some places just like people when confronted with extraordinary and sudden unpleasant situations. Good flick. 8/10 stars.

There are flaws in the film, to be sure - inexplicable, jarring camera shots, and holes in the story that are never sewn together. But there are also many really good moments, and some terrific acting by Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, and especially, surprisingly, Lindsay Lohan. In a way, I get irritated when I watch this movie, because I see how good Lindsay Lohan is, and how she has the potential for greatness - and how her personal life seems to be eclipsing her considerable talent. It's a damn shame, and I truly hope someone can talk some sense into the girl, because after seeing Georgia Rule, I think she has the ability to be a fine actress - who knew?

Okay, you may laugh at that, but it's not as bad as you think or as bad as critics say. The one big flaw in this movie is having drama and comedy at the wrong time. We laugh at one scene and then the next scene talks about a serious subject and then it goes back to light-hearted comedy.

That's the ONLY bad thing about the movie. Other than that, the movie is just fine, although it really didn't have a satisfying ending. This is obviously Lindsay Lohan's most mature and best work so far. She gives a terrific performance as well as the other two fine ladies of the cast, Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman.

Yeah, it's not as emotional and as truthful to the serious topics in the film. Yeah, this film is inconsistent at many times, but overall, Georgia Rule is a decent movie with some great performances."

Permalink",False,"After reading others' comments on this film, it sounds like I am simply lucky not to have seen the trailer. As it is, Georgia Rule is a fairly hard-hitting family drama, and I thought it did a great job of showing both the flaws and strengths of three generations of women: Rachel (Lindsay Lohan, who is absolutely great, aside from the semi-valid criticism that she is basically playing herself), a bratty California sex-pot who's been hiding a traumatic secret in the interest of her mother's happiness; Lilly (Felicity Huffman, consistently strong), who clearly loves her daughter despite her struggles with alcoholism and guilt over her role in her daughter's troubles; and the eponymous Georgia (Jane Fonda, fantastic), a somewhat self-centered disciplinarian who honestly takes the interests of her family at heart.

I think a lot of the poor reviews for this film are based on the fact that it simply is not a comedy (which I understand is how it was advertised). Even the infamous blow-job scene is actually one of the saddest parts of the whole movie, as Lohan really expresses the pain of a teenager who has come to believe that her sexuality is the only part of her that is worthy of attention.

The film itself is by no means Oscar-worthy, but it's not worthy of a Rotten Tomato either. It's a decently engaging family drama about three women who are falling apart and who -- with varying degrees of success -- manage to support each other when they need it most."

No, I'm not Mormon but the values this movie had to offer were refreshing. I thought Huffman was good too. I missed some of the movie when I left to hit the john and grab some popcorn. But it was nothing I couldn't live without. When I got back to my seat I knew exactly what was going on. I don't think you need to unnecessarily complicate a story with complex characters and emotions. Keep it simple, stupid. I'd recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor and a heart.

Permalink",True,"Well I was pleasantly surprised, I must say. I expected a somewhat pathetic film that highlighted the relationships between mothers and their daughters that would discredit the talent of Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. On the contrary, all three actresses were very good and played their roles strongly.

The film was not at all what I expected....definitely not a mushy, soft film about womens relationships with each other. Instead the subject matter was dark and somewhat intense, with the entire movie being based around the fact that Rachels (Lindsay Lohan) stepfather repeatedly sexually abused her from the age of 12....which ultimately led her to her self destructive behavior which then landed her in Idaho with her grandmother over the summer. I now understand why the film was rated R in the US.

Small town life in Idaho is well demonstrated through the Mormon characters she befriends and the values they uphold. Ultimately, they help Rachel to develop some kind of self respect. However, there were too many characters in this film. The implication of that being that some of the characters were redundant or not focused on enough. More should have been made about the past relationship between Lily (Felicity Huffman) and her old high school sweetheart - their one passionate kiss in his office left everything in mid - air.

Overall a very enjoyable (although quite dark) film which shows Lohan as a promising talent and gives credit to the excellence of Huffman and Jane Fonda.

The encounters between Lindsay and Garrett made me laugh. Yes, you can be Mormon, Catholic, or any other religion, but you are still human too.

My girlfriend that I saw this with was very touched by this movie. She has friends in similar situations, dealing with abuse and incest, and this hit a little close to home for her. We both did not expect to be in tears during this movie, but it had its moments, and so did we.

Strong performances in this one. Whatever you think of Lindsay Lohan, put it aside and watch her in this movie. She was right on the money."

Permalink",True,"Well I bit the bullet and took my better half to see this. She went with me to see 28 Weeks Later the day before so all is fair in love and war right?!?!? I manned up if you will expecting The Holiday. I truly hated The Holiday. Anyway I don't care about Lohan or Hilton or anyone of these tabloid whores who cares frankly when I saw the preview for Georgia Rule I could taste the bile in the back of my throat hot and acid like. So yeah the movie its about mothers and daughters spread across three generations all of whom are independent fiery intelligent and really screwed up and in need of some closure. Jane Fonda is the driving female lead here. Lohan is really funny in a tragic anti heroine kind of way sort of I guess well at least she wasn't the giant anchor that sunk the entire movie. I really respect the fact that the filmmakers decided to ignore typical conventions ie one dimensional male clichés wherein the women overcome their problems by banding together and castrating the man, metaphorically at least. The men in these movies usually just stand there like fixtures as they're cut to pieces all for the sake of false bs girl power. Sometimes however there's a more affectionate male cast whom these woman find solace and peace of mind in. They are just as manufactured and false. Dermot Mulroney as Simon is the driving male lead and I was rooting for him not to fall prey to these stereo types and he doesn't. Cary Elwes is the resident bad guy but the script is good and several times during the course of the movie you question that fact hard and even in the end its hard to say for sure. Either way no matter which side of the sexual pendulum your standing on this ideology is unrealistic and offensive to both men and women yet has been recycled and reprocessed over and over for decades now. Georgia Rule isn't entirely liberated from these crap romantic comedy standards but it does skillfully counter balance them into something a little bit more fair and little less groan inducing. I feel even if I were a woman I would be extremely offended by what passes as romantic or funny or dramatic thats targeted at women.Just as a person more often than not I feel like im being talked down to while watching this crap.In the end my opinion doesn't mean much and thats fine really but I watch a lot of movies not specifically one type either I will watch pretty much anything without judgment except things starring Larry the Cable Guy. Georgia Rule is a solid real movie if your able to leave your grudges and pride at the door. All in all Georgia Rule is well made well acted and well paced.

Permalink",False,"I detect an inordinate number of shills in here. It's reasonable for some to like and some to dislike a movie, and so it goes. But when you see such a wide disparity of opinion and voting, coupled with superficiality, clichés and repetition, one should begin to suspect the honesty of some posts.

Personally, I dislike Jane Fonda as an actress, and I don't think she was ever very good. IMO she rode into the movies on the coattails of her father, who actually did have talent. A movie with Jane Fonda in it is highly likely to be a movie I won't waste my money on. Her name gets her more screen time than her talent can fill.

Movies, again IMO, should not be 2-hour repetitions of the bad news we see on TV and in the paper every day. Why do producers and directors think that we should spend $10 and two hours of our time to be told *yet again* that we human beings can be bad, so bad, and you and I should feel bad because we're all so bad.

I think that negativity, like negative reinforcement, is not the best way to solve a problem or improve behavior. We live with reality every day, why should we pay to have scripted ""reality"" thrown in our faces at the movie house?

Permalink",False,"18 May 2007. Sometimes a movie comes around that has important subject matter to present. Georgia Rules is an unpretentious, entertaining, and realistic look at child abuse and the way that in really impacts individuals. Lindsay Lohan gives a wonderful performance with dynamic and authentic emotions. Some may see stereotypical, melodrama, but on the surface, this movie hits just the right level of performance and entertainment, and handles its material in a sensitive but not overly dramatic way like serious, independent movies do. The collision of city and rural cultures is palpable. The religious subtext is touched on with care. The acting and script is natural and believable when taken in the context of the situation and counseling standpoint. Instead of gritty, hard core, raw movie, this is a great movie that makes its point with naturalism and almost a breezy, entertaining perspective without glossing over the serious nature of its topic. The issues of trust, communication, betrayal, and values are all well presented. Nine out of Ten Stars.

Perfectly cast Lindsay Lohan comes to stay at grandmother Jane Fonda's house for the summer. She's a horrendous troublemaker, with sex, drugs, and booze as her extracurricular activities, and her mother, Felicity Huffman, doesn't know what to do with her. At the end of her rope, Felicity takes her to her estranged mother's house, hoping the strictness will straighten her out. Of course, throughout the movie, the ladies will bond, cry, learn, and grow. That's how these movies work! This one is great to watch if you've never seen a film in this genre, or if you're in the mood for an estrogen fest with a little eye candy. Pour the mimosas for a bunch of your girlfriends, or for you and your mom, and get ready for the classiest cheesy movie of the summer.

Permalink",True,"What a difference three years makes. Back in 2004 Lindsay Lohan was wickedly fresh as a daisy in the teenage drama ""Mean Girls"". Three years later in ""Georgia Rule"", I look at her and I ask myself, what happened? I mean she's still got some sort of physical attraction here, but compared to ""Mean Girls"", she looks jaded and looking like she's entering into a world of sorrow and lament. It feels like she's aged drastically. At the time Lohan was 21 years old, but in ""Georgia Rule"", she looks like she's aged to 31.

""Georgia Rule"" is equally disjointed and out of focus as Lohan's physical presence. It's kind of a sinister, out of touch film that focuses primarily on three generations of the Wilcox/Randall family clan. Wehave the tough and disciplined grandmother Georgia Randall (Jane Fonda),the ever inebriated mother Lilly (Felicity Huffman) and the rebellious,sex-craving daughter, Rachel (Lohan). The idea of an out-of control daughter may have some levels of intrigue, but director Garry Marshall and screenwriter Mark Andrus turn a blind eye towards her incorrigible ways. Let alone the fact that Miss Lohan looks less like a teenager and more like a lounge singer playing Broadway musicals in karaoke bars.

Maybe it might work in the Hollywood industry, but switch to reality for just a second, but if the opening scenes feature a teenage daughter, belittling, ostracizing and verbally bullying your own mother, you're all programmed to hate this snotty little punk. Oh, that's right, Rachel is an angry late adolescent who's so undisciplined that her mother made her leave her home in San Francisco to spend some time at grandma's house in Idaho, where she's hopes will set her straight. Where's the responsibility mom? Or is something I like to call an urban renewal?

Does Grandma Georgia really need an incorrigible child placed at her doorstep? She's a women of moral restriction with an obsessive compulsiveness for tight, at the exact minute of scheduling, even though she seems lenient towards the neighborhood children. But she still dwells back to the fact her daughter's a drunk and her granddaughter is out-of-control and promiscuous. The purpose of this story is that in spite all their shortcomings, they love each other. But it's panned out in the cruelest of taste.

The tone of the film is extremely jarring it left me wondering are these people for real? The movie was made to have a light drama with touches of comedy for good measure. But I felt very little in lightness or anything I could pass off as comical. This movie was cynical in approach and Marshall gave us the impression that his audience are as mixed up as the characters on screen.

One supposed ""funny"" scene has Rachel making lustful passes with an overly religious Mormon named Harlan Wilson (Garrett Hedlund) then performing off camera oral sex. It gets better! There's a scene where she threatens these goody-goody Mormon girls to engage in lascivious relations with their boyfriends. In other words, be like her and you will be ""cool"". But is she ""cool""? Not in the slightest, in fact I find her and her dysfunctional family nothing more than hypocrites who preach but don't practice.

Here we have Rachel threatening these girls she will get all raunchy with their other halves and yet we get a revealing that Rachel's step-father, Arnold (Cary Elwes) sexually molested her. By now Lilly is now a full-blown inebriate. Which is strange because Grandma Georgia disallows alcoholism in her household and yet she's got shelves of booze to keep Lilly amused as she's lying in her underwear getting stewed. This is a horrible family with horrible people and it sickens me that Fonda, Huffman and Lohan are incredibly talented performers makes it even harder to swallow. It's not that they're wasting away here every foundation of this movie is based off of lies. It tries to be truthful, but fails at every attempt.

The sexual abuse subplot is the the hardest one to take into account because of the hypocrisy that comes all around. We get cringing jokes about oral sex and yet you have Rachel, flaunting around town engaging in sexual activities with the town. But then we're supposed to feel sorry for her once the serious topic of sexual abuse comes around and we're forced into thinking she's just a poor lost soul. Like we should just forget about all the heartbreak Rachel has because we don't approve of her stepfather who sexually abused her when she was twelve.

Jane Fonda stars as Georgia, the tough as nails bad ass grandmother that will do just about anything for her daughter (Huffman) and granddaughter (Lindsay Lohan). Felicity Huffman is GREAT here too! Huffman really is a very talented actress and that fine acting ability is displayed here. She plays the mother of the rebellious daughter. Her dynamic with both Lohan and Fonda is great, the on screen chemistry between them all is electric. This movie has so many great messages to teach about love, family, and forgiveness. Yes, the characters aren't close at all at first and yes they behave badly in the beginning, but it's not about how they started out, it's all about progress and how they all evolve. The script is written very well and it flows well all throughout. The characters are all given an ample amount of good lines and you feel satisfied by the end. I didn't feel like this film was lacking or was weak in any way. 8/10 for Georgia Rule! The ending is very well done.

I wonder if this isn't some of Lindsay Lohan true life. Someone who was born innocent and robbed of that innocence by the evil money grubbing sex addicts in the Hollywood under world. I am pleasantly surprised that Hollywood took this story and shed light on it for the world to see. When grown men sexually abuse young women or even boys you are robbing them of there innocence.

Permalink",True,"Georgia Rule (2007): Dir: Garry Marshall / Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, Dermot Mulroney, Cary Elwes: Rule in question regards bonding within three generations. Jane Fonda plays a grandmother in Idaho. Felicity Huffman plays her alcoholic daughter. Lindsay Lohan plays the granddaughter who cannot differentiate between truth or lie. Flawed with its comical ads that cover serious undertones. Director Garry Marshall does a fantastic job. He is famed for such films as Pretty Woman and Overboard. Fonda is terrific as the no nonsense grandmother who will no doubt set everything and everyone straight. Huffman struggles to understand her daughter and what is right or wrong. She also deals with alcoholism and an ex-husband her daughter claims molested her when she was younger. It is difficult to accept her state of being in the end because she is jerked in so many directions for a sappy ending to work. Lohan is wonderful as the foul mouth daughter who deflowers a local male and attempts to seduce an old fling of her mother. Her revelation is also difficult to accept. Dermot Mulroney plays a veterinarian who used to date Huffman. Cary Elwes plays Huffman's ex and Lohan's stepfather whose presence is unwelcome by Fonda. While the conclusion might try to tidy things up too abruptly, the film stresses the strength in family and rules made to mend. Score: 8 / 10

Permalink",False,"This was better than I was expecting, but it was also not what I was expecting. For starters this isn't the usual Garry Marshall comedy as its being marketed (on the poster it says ""from the director of Pretty Woman and the Princess Diaries). Sure there are some funny situations and great lines here but ultimately this deals with sexual abuse, alcoholism and 3 generations of messed up women. I guess that's funny in an awkward sort of way.

My moral compass was all kinds of confused here watching a teenage girl confess to sleeping with her step daddy to her drunken mother and then going about some small town related comedy.

Anyways, once I got on board with what I was watching I did enjoy this. Lindsay Lohan is given a great role which, even with the benefit of the doubt she's pretty terrible at. She plays Rachel, an out-of-control teen whose foul mouth and promiscuous behaviour have become too much for her long-suffering mother. Felicity Huffman, as the mom drives Rachel to Georgia to spend the summer with her own demanding mother (Jane Fonda) who immediately lays down the ""Georgia Rules"" and puts Rachel to work.

Rachel proceeds to shake up the small town then reveals a secret which brings her mother rushing back from California to find out if its true. The audience is also left wondering if its true. Felicity Huffman and Jane Fonda give powerhouse performances (as expected), they can do the drama and I'll admit that even LeLo grew on me by the end. I also really liked the Dermot Mulroney storyline.

Ultimately if this had been marketed properly it might have found its target audience, this is a dramedy and no 'Princess Diaries' . 1/26/15"

George Rule may not be a comedy that you expect from its trailer (totally misguiding trailer). It's funny at times but in a whole, it's a painful and touching story. I was surprised at the way Gary Marshall conveyed this hard issue into a soft and nice movie like that. The acting was good, for the three female leading. Despite rumors about her bad behaviors on set, Lohan was still very good in the movie. I really miss her. She's such a talent who is struggling to find a way back from hell. Jane Fonda was good, too. She said she hated Lohan, but in the movie we just see a lovely grandma who loves her children a lot and deeply. This movie is much better than many chick flick out there. It's touching, it's no cliché, it's funny but no big talk, and it's real, very real. I give it an 8 for the scale of chick flicks alone, and a 6.5 for the scale of movies. Nice to see it.Totally not a waste of time.

Permalink",False,"As a victim of abuse my self, I can well understand the denial of the mother, especially if she was already a boozer. The grandmother, so well played by Jane Fonda, obviously felt the guilt from turning her own child into an alcoholic, who then allowed this abuse to go on under her roof. She became the typical non-defending parent.

The scene with Delmot Maroney (simon) in which he talks to her about the different kinds of love between an older man and a young woman (friend, parent) that differs from the abusive kind, rings quite true. Because, for people like us, it's hard to tell the difference as you emerge from your parental Hell.

You only know how to relate in a sexual manner with any man. It takes a lot of education and experience to learn to appreciate and enjoy the other kinds of love and affection. Until then, it all seems fake. Don't know what the reviewers had to say about this, but I appreciate Jane and Gary for actually tackling such a loaded subject.

Permalink",True,"I was mislead like many others by the trailers. I thought it was going to be much more funny. This was definitely more drama than comedy. When I heard that it was based in Idaho I felt like I should go watch, just to see. I really wasn't sure I was going to like it because I am not one to like movies that they base in Idaho (i.e. Nepolean Dynamite). I am from Idaho...born and raised and so it sometimes feels like they are portraying us as strictly rednecks. Now don't get me wrong...being a redneck is never a bad thing, speaking from experience. It usually ends up being frustrating to see how they think we would act though. I watched this film and really enjoyed it. We weren't the backwards people we sometimes get made out to be. I thought it was very nicely done. It was nice to see that they showed the small town Idaho atmosphere.

I only have one issue really with the movie. After I watched the DVD I watched the special features, like anyone normally does. I wasn't surprised to see that it hadn't been filmed at all in Idaho. Now maybe this seems like nitpicking but they should have done a bit more research on the area the town was suppose to be located in, and the actual amount of time it would take to go on the trip that Mulronneys character takes as well as the one that Hedlund and Lohan take. The town in the film is suppose to be located near Wallace, Idaho. Wallace is in northern Idaho, towards Kellogg and Coeur 'dAlene. That area is very different than the scenery that was shown in the film. There was too much sage brush and not enough pine trees. There is actually no sage brush near Wallace. Southern Idaho area near Boise has sage brush. Being what we call the high desert we have lots of that there.

Also when the veterinarian (Dermott Mulronney) travels to Rexburg, Idaho, it was a bit far-fetched for me to believe that he made that trip as short as he made it sound like it would be. That trip is about 450 miles one way, that's the easiest way to get there. That trip would take about 7 hours one way. So for him to leave Hull and get to Rexburg in what he made it sound was just a couple of hours is really hard to believe. As well as the trip that Hedlund and Lohan make...would have been around 14 hours of just driving. I know that there aren't to many people outside of Idaho who would know that. But we do watch movies here in Idaho and when you base a movie here...chances are we are definitely going to watch it. I was disappointed with that part.

Other than that small issue I thought that Marshall and the actors that he had did and very nice job. I was pleasantly surprised and went out later and bought the movie!

Permalink",True,"As many of the other reviews stated, the trailer for this movie was severely misleading. The clip is a short collection of what some might consider the most comical scenes in the movie. If it weren't for other users, I wouldn't have even considered watching Georgia Rules. Because I had assumed it was 'just another chick flick'. Which it is far from.

Georgia Rules tells the story of a rebellious teenager, Lindsay Lohan, sent to spend the summer in a remote town in Idaho. Living with her Grandmother, Jane Fonda, whose rules are strict and affection limited- Lindsay Lohan's Mother, Felicity Huffman, hopes for a change in her daughter's behaviour. Initially, the Mother seems sane and relatively unperturbed by her hectic life. It later becomes clear that her coping mechanism is an alcoholic tendency, which she inherited from her Father. Each of the women have difficult relationships with each other. And its clear that Mothers and Daughters are not allies in the family. Born and raised in California, Lindsay and Felicity (Who portray Rachael and Lilly), create quite a stir in a quiet religious town.

This isn't a romantic comedy. In fact, there's very little romance at all. The last line of the movie, to me, was the funniest. I didn't find this movie comical, I found it tragic. Each of the characters are complex. So complex, its very credible. Each of them do wrong, but in their wrong there is right. Several times through out, Rachael (Lindsay Lohan), is told that she no longer knows the difference between right and wrong. And in so many ways, that is the underlying moral of this story. The fact that there is a fine line between two opposites.

This is only enforced, when the audience apprehends that Rachael had in fact been sexually molested by her step father as a child, and that her being a ""slut"" was merely a quest for rejection. She looks for rejection. The confusion of emotions, the mistrusting, the growing relationships and human mistakes- make this movie worth watching. And, for me at least, easy to relate to.

Permalink",True,"There are too many stories within the main story here. Jane Fonda's perfection of a mother is a story in itself. The hangups of widower Dermott Mulroney are also interesting. A Mormon guy (Cary Elwes) wants to go to do missionary work for 2 years, but at the same time he is conflicted about his current life.

All this serves as the backdrop to the real theme of the daughter of Fonda, an alcoholic, whose second husband may have sexually abused her daughter.

The performances here are all quite good. The big surprise is Lindsay Lohan. If she'd only get her act together in real life, she could definitely be a star in the making.

The movie has a really important theme,but there are too many subordinate clauses that should have been dealt with.

Had this movie been 35+ years ago, Fonda would have been a sensation in the Lohan part, a rebel in every way possible.

Permalink",True,"I liked the 2007 bomb Georgia Rule for one main reason. The actors in this film make it come alive. Not Dermot Mulroney or Cary Elwes, surprisingly. Jane Fonda, Lindsay Lohan, and Felicity Huffman. These are three talented actresses. Mostly Lindsay Lohan and Jane Fonda. But Huffman is fine too.

Now I will admit this. But I do like Lindsay Lohan even today. I'll admit that she obviously hasn't made the best decisions in life but I do like her. I like her more than Hillary Duff. Cause at least she has some talent. and Jane Fonda, who could blame me? Why else would I enjoy Monster in law? Everyone hated it. I didn't cause of Fonda.

The film is about a troubled teen(obviously played by Lindsay Lohan)who is being taken down to Idaho to live with her strict Grandmother(played by Jane Fonda). While down there, the grandmother gets her a job. At a town festival, she tells her boss(played by Dermot Mulroney) that her step father(played by Cary Elwes) and her had sex. So the grandmother calls the mother(played by Felicity Huffman) and she comes down to live with her. And she starts to drink again.

Alright, well, the plot is nothing too special. Though I was very interested by the film. Oh I forgot another part of the plot. Lohan's character also meets a Mormon and once she has sex with him, he tells his girlfriend and her friends start to spy on them.

Lohan is funny in this film. There is a scene where these teenage girls are spying on them and Lohan goes""Now if you don't leave us alone, I will find all of your boyfriends and f*ck them stupid"". I laughed at this film. I was entertained. Though it definitely isn't art, I still think it's worth seeing.

Permalink",True,"As noted 1000 times already this movie is not what it was marketed to be. For those of us who work in the field of child abuse it is a spot-on account of the struggle a young person feels when caught up in an incestuous family life. Lohan is astonishingly successful in creating Rachel, a character who like so many teens afflicted in this way, is both deep and cleverly superficial. In fact, Rachel explains quite well and with reasonable sensitivity the victim's persistent search for someone who when given the chance, will not harm her -- and her disappointment in having not found that healing experience. Jane Fonda's role is less significant here -- which surprised me. It is not really Georgia and her rules that bring about the change in this girl, but her own exploration of her flawed sexuality and the way in which it came into being. Most troubling was the role of Felicity Huffman as the mother who ends up being mostly a drunken caricature of the non-offending parent. However, until the scene at Simon's apartment the movie generally works as Lohan struggles against her own confused feelings for each of her family members.

At the very moment Simon deftly refuses her advances the film drops off a cliff and never recovers. The scene is beautifully set for her to finally find someone who can care for her (as he himself puts it) as a father or friend and not as a sexual partner. And Simon plays his role with sensitivity and honesty. Then Lohan's Rachel essentially pats him on the arm and says ""oh gee thanks!."" Unlike her moving response to the early entrapment of the Mormon boy in the boat, the rest of her scene with Simon is strikingly silly -- at the very moment when it should have been most touching. Fortunately for the movie, Dermot Mulroney pulls the scene off without much help from Lohan. But then things being to really hit the skids. Lohan's trip to her stepfather's motel room is actually very creepy and uncomfortable -- and not in a way that builds much empathy for Rachel. That she wants to sacrifice herself for her mother is admirable and actually very realistic in these situations. That she chooses to do so by proposing she has a video tape of her stepfather's sexual abuse is cringe-worthy at best. There are about 100 ways they could have made this point at this juncture of the film and this is pretty much the last one that should have been chosen.

The final scenes do not fair better. Mother Lilly's realization in the car that step-dad is buying off Rachel with a car doesn't really make any sense. Rachel did not make that deal with him at all and it is nonsense to think that she would take such a bribe. What she bargained for was her mother's happiness (see creepy motel scene above) not her own self- gain. It would have been far more moving for Lilly to pick upon on something Georgia said earlier and to suddenly ""just know"" that her daughter was telling the truth ""because you are a part of me."" They set that one up beautifully and then just let it drop in favor of this odd scene.

Worse, is the stepfathers icky confession of having molested the girl and that ""she liked it"" before he drives away leaving Lilly on the side of the road. Having worked this circuit many times, I can safely say that there is no chance this guy would have behaved in this manner -- and a better plot development would not have required him to do so.

In short, the last 20 minutes of the film nearly ruin an otherwise superb and complex effort. In my layman's analysis I would estimate that this film got seriously damaged in the cutting room. It goes slowly and intricately through 100 minutes of detail and development and then simply runs out of time and steam when it matters most. It's worth watching to have a better understanding of the inner struggles and turmoils of a sex abuse victim and her disturbed family dynamic. But the drop at the end -- and a few other improbable plot twists -- take it from being a good file into a pretty mediocre one.

Permalink",False,"Several of the user comments I read at the Internet Movie Database pointed out that this film was a victim of bad advertising, and I very much agree. I thought it was going to be another of those wacky women comedies some of which are enjoyable and some of which are real dogs - Because I Said So starring Diane Keaton comes to mind. I decided to rent it mainly because it starred Jane Fonda. When I saw that my video service had classified it as a drama, I was assuming that they had simply made a mistake - the most common being categorizing a drama as a comedy. Well, they hit this one on the nose. Director Gary Marshall states in the special features on the DVD that he usually directs comedy-dramas and that this is his first drama-comedy. As a matter of fact, there are few moments of comedy in this serious depiction of a young woman in crisis brought about by generations of family dysfunction.

Lindsay Lohan plays the young woman, Rachel, who is sent to spend the summer with her grandmother, Georgia, by her exasperated mother, Lilly. I don't know much about Lindsay Lohan, but from what I've seen on television news and tabloid shows, it seems that the part of drug soaked, sex kitten Rachel is not too distant from the real life of Lohan. I hope that the media reports are overblown for I hate to think of any young person sacrificing her life, but I can tell you that her portrayal of Rachel is absorbing and heart breaking. Lohan is incredibly attractive and sexy, but she goes far below the surface to give us an insightful look at a confused young woman poised upon the edge of disaster.

Rachel's mother, Lilly is at her wit's end as to how to deal with her daughter, so she takes her to spend her last summer before college with her no-nonsense grandmother from whom Lilly has been estranged for years. The producers of the film couldn't have found anyone better to play a woman ready for a breakdown than Felicity Huffman. There is no melodramatic wringing of hands. Huffman gives us an intelligent woman who has tried everything she knows to help her daughter defeat her demons but has reached the point where she understands that it is necessary to circumvent the problem for her own mental well-being. Lilly is a person torn asunder by her daughter, her husband, her estranged mother, and her own addiction to alcohol, and Huffman offers a raw and shattering look into Lilly's life.

As for Jane Fonda, - the object of my initial interest in the film - she is good, damn good, but, I think, somewhat miscast in her roll as Georgia. Georgia is a conservative woman who follows unyielding schedules and rules - thus the title of the film. I think that Jane Fonda's persona is just a bit too sophisticated for this part, but she is still a joy to watch in this roll of Georgia which is very reminiscent of her father's role of Norman in On Golden Pond.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the performances of the actors playing the three major male characters in the film. Cary Elwes is perfectly slick and slimy as the California attorney who is the husband of Lilly and the stepfather of Rachel. Dermot Mulroney is effective as the one-time boyfriend who stayed in the home town but is now suffering from supreme grief over the loss of his wife and child. And finally, Garrett Hedlund is a treat as the young love interest exuding just the right amount of young sexuality and naïveté.

If you are interested in viewing a sober and engrossing depiction of a family in crisis, forget what you might have concluded from the advertisements for this film and give Georgia Rule a spin."

Permalink",False,"Java Man Reviews Georgia Rule (Rated R). Directed by Gary Marshall. Written by Mark Andrus. Starring Lindsay Lohan, Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, Dermot Mulroney, Garrett Hedlund, Cary Elwes & Hector Elizondo. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com June, 2007.

OVERVIEW:

Rachel (Lohan) is a rebellious, sexually precocious California teen whose alcoholic mother, Lilly (Huffman), exiles her to Idaho to spend a precollege summer with her tea-totaling, rule-making grandmother, Georgia (Fonda). Upon arrival, she meets two local yokels whom she immediately attempts to seduce... Harlan (Hedlund), a virgin about to embark on a mission for the Mormons; and Simon (Mulroney), the town's veterinarian who also extends his practice to include humans. It all seems like another off-color sex farce from director Marshall (Pretty Woman) until we realize that Rachel may have been sexually abused by her stepfather (Elwes). Hector Elizondo, who has inexplicably appeared in all of Marshall's features, turns up in this one as a Basque rancher and one of Simon's two-legged patients.

REVIEW: 2.5 out of 4 Java Mugs

Garry Marshall, who contributed Laverne and Shirley to the cultural landscape, is today's king of Capra-Corn. Nearly all of his film's have been syrupy and satisfying, as though life is just wonderful. Even a woman who sells herself for sex (Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman) is redeemed by schmaltzy notions of romantic love. With this movie, however, Marshall seems to have unwittingly crossed over to the Dark Side. Though he should be given credit for trying his hand at serious themes, the movie is a mess. It's a tragedy directed as though it were a comedy... something like Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman re-imagined by Neil Simon.

Yet the film is quite watchable, due mainly to a handful of fine performances. Fonda creates her most interesting character in decades; with her wizened face and penetrating gaze, she bears an uncanny (or canny) resemblance to her father. Huffman is reliably unstable as the inebriated mom, but goes over the top in a few of her scenes. Of the men, Mulroney's droll doctor is the most appealing, while Hedlund's Harlan, is the least convincing... which brings up another problem with the movie. Harlan, a Mormon, also drives a pickup truck, with a dog in the back, as though he were auditioning for a country music video. The Hollywood filmmakers do not seem to have any idea what types of characters might inhabit a small town in Idaho (or even Utah, where the Mormons actually live). In fact, film crew traveled to neither state, but shot entirely in southern California.

But this is Lohan's movie. She is in nearly every scene, and holds her own with two Oscar-caliber actresses -- while keeping the men in a constant state of confusion. Some may say that she is merely portraying herself here, a troubled young girl with more sex appeal than she can handle. But even if this is true, the character she plays is so complex that any actress who can pull it off can look forward to a long and rewarding career in the movies, or . . . stay tuned."

Permalink",False,"""Georgia Rule"" is clichéd and it's somewhat unbelievable, but Garry Marshall pulls off an effective drama nonetheless with the help of a truly talented cast.

Backstory aside, Lindsay Lohan provides a decent performance as Rachel, a troubled teenage girl who has a history of drug/alcohol abuse and rebellious behavior. (I'm talking about her character.) Felicity Huffman is Lily, her mother, who, on the verge of a mental breakdown from the stress of keeping up with Rachel, forces her daughter to stay in a remote Idaho town over the summer with her grandmother.

Jane Fonda is the most entertaining presence in the film as Georgia, Lily's mother, who agrees to take Rachel in and hopefully get some sense into her. Of course Rachel doesn't want to be anywhere near Georgia, who she hasn't known since she was a little girl, but typically she begins to enjoy her stay, and begins to understand her grandmother. Everything is going well until the comedy drama takes a huge twist and we discover that Rachel's stepfather may have molested her. Georgia and Lily must uncover the truth as Rachel comes to terms with her life and her mistakes.

Although the movie is clichéd and somewhat predictable, it is heartfelt and overall more satisfying and enjoyable than one might think. The three actresses are a great match together and they play off one another well, and Lohan proves she still has talent, if only she could clean her act up off screen then maybe more people would take her films seriously."

Lindsay Lohan wasn't too bad in this film. She gives an interesting performance along with some funny lines!

Permalink",False,"I thought the movie was better than expected and certainly better than the critics stated. All the critiques that I read all spent about 70% of the review discussing Lindsay Lohan's problems, which have nothing to do with rating and reviewing the movie. I very much disagree with the majority of the movie critics and I am sure there are 1,000s of others who agree with me. I thought the cast was mostly excellent. The boy who played Ethan was good and cute. I had not seen him before. And the three women did an excellent acting job, even though Lohan may have been acting herself (so what!). Both Felicity Huffman's and Lohan's performances are as good as those female actors of past years who have been up for Academy Awards. Just about everyone I spoke with who saw the movie liked it very much and were surprised at how good it was.

I give Gary Marshall credit for taking on a very difficult story and telling it well in the short amount of time available for a movie on screen. I don't second guess a director for what he takes on, nor do I require one to stay with a certain style or story just because he has done it before. Those critics who want a more comedic style from Marshall can stay up late and watch reruns, on cable, from those styles they want to compare to comedic movies of the past. The rest of us will move on and enjoy movies that show diversity and interesting topics without the majority of movie critics biased mis-judgement."

Permalink",True,"The trailer was likely intentionally misleading to try to maximize the sale of tickets. Unfortunately, what people thought was going to be a comedy was more of a tragic story with a hopeful ending. The movie is provocative and controversial because of the sex and taboo sex topics in a religious community setting. Unfortunately, those topics are too sensitive for many who will avoid the movie and/or give it a bad review.

All too often people grow up too fast and have to learn life's lessons the hard way. When parents failure to provide the important life's lessons to their children at the appropriate ages, the result can be three or more generations of dysfunctional people as depicted in the movie. The story in the movie provides hope for these people in that it is never to late to help ourselves and others to learn life's lessons and live a rich remaining life.

Permalink",True,"Jane Fonda is Georgia, and in her household when something is done only a certain way, she invokes ""Georgia Rule"", thus the title of the movie.

As the story begins, mom and daughter are on a car trip in an area of Utah with mountains (actually filmed outside Los Angeles) and it is clear they are not getting along very well. The 17-year-old daughter Rachel (Linsay Lohan) accuses the mother Lilly (Felicity Huffman) of simply wanting to get rid of her, and she gets out of the car and insists on walking. Lilly is Georgia's daughter, and Rachel is on her way to spend the summer with grandma in the small Utah town, because mom can't get anywhere with her.

There are strained relationships between Georga and Lilly, but Rachel hasn't seen grandma since she was very small. The story revolves around the three generations of females working to resolve their issues, while hoping to give Rachel a fresh start as she prepares to go off to college in New York.

Dermot Mulroney is Simon , the local vet, who seems to treat more human patients during a day than the 4-legged kind. Georgia gets Rachel a job as the receptionist for the summer for Simon's clinic.

Cary Elwes is Arnold, Lilly's lawyer husband and Rachel's stepfather back in San Francisco. He shows up to add spice to the drama.

This is a Garry Marshall movie, and as such treats very serious material with a healthy dose of humor throughout. Without that the movie would probably be unwatchable. As it is, my wife and I enjoyed it, good acting within a worthwhile story, and we recommended it to other couples we know.

MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW: Rachel is beyond precocious, she is a slut. She right away targets a young man who she finds out is virgin, and on a fishing expedition takes off her underwear, flashes her privates, then proceeds to perform oral sex. This is a glimpse of her mindset, with no boundaries and unable to differentiate between right and wrong. Then, she accuses her step-dad of having a sexual relationship with her between her ages of 12 and 14, but then later recants saying she just wanted to see if mom and others would believe her. However, in the end we find out it really was true, and in a telling exchange on the highway as he was leaving, Arnold says, ""But she seduced me."" She probably did, but a man, especially a stepfather, should never let that happen with a young girl. So the movie ends with Lilly promising to ""see you in court"" and Arnold saying ""I look forward to it, bring it on."" However, the experience seemed to give the three generations of females a start at mending their relationships. And Rachel may have the beginning of establishing boundaries for herself.

Permalink",True,"First just let me start off by saying that I was never going to rent this movie and I did not go to the theater to see it. After hearing such bad things about it, I had decided it wasn't for me. But on a recent flight from NY, they were showing it so I decided I would tune in. The beginning was pretty rough (read: stupid) and part of me was torn between trying to catch some Z's or stick it out. I ended up finishing the film and I do not feel it was a complete waste of boring flight time.

I was really surprised by the content of this story as I was expecting the usual light hearted film from Marshall. Not an intense, upsetting story about child molestation. However, there were some highs and lows to the movie and as I said it was a good way to kill time.

Permalink",False,"this film was well both good and bad, the acting for the most part was mediocre but at times managed to reach a depth of emotion that actually had me feeling something other than ""oh my god when will it be over"", at times it was cringe worthy but Lohan managed to just about pull it off. in the end it was an OK film overall and touched on disturbing yet real subjects rather than the typical American teen comedy which lacks any depth of any kind - this had substance and reality. I would suggest watching this if you want a bit of a laugh - at times it is highly amusing although it feels slightly incomplete and there deems to be a lack of flow through the film like the director didn't really know where it was going and in the ends closed his eyes picked a spot and decided to leave it there. Although it fits in with Lohans character its not the best way to structure a film.

Permalink",False,"I watched this movie, thinking it was going to be some teen-focused over dramatic film courtesy of Lindsay Lohan but shockingly, it was really well written and the acting was...fantastic.

Jane Fonda was hilarious with her ""No taking the lord's name in vain"" even though you can still say ""f*ck you"" and her crazy bar of soap antics and threats to take a bat to Arnold (Cary Elwes) Lindsay Lohan was one of my greatest fears for this movie. I originally thought she was going to do exactly what she did in ""I know who killed me"" and over act and just all around ruin the movie. But surprisingly she delivered a great performance for the emotional scenes and kicks of humor thrown in.

When first began watching the movie and saw how promiscuous Lohan was acting I thought ""Oh great just some stupid movie for her to pimp herself out in."" But as the story develops you realize that Rachel is the way she is for a reason and a damn good one at that.

Another awesome performance is by Garrett Hedlund, a fairly new actor whose starred in quite a few major movie hits. In Death Sentence he played a psychotic, over protective of his brother, father hating gang leader who kills without regret. He delivered a chilling performance that out shined Kevin Bacon by far. But in Georgia Rule he played a sweet Mormon virgin boy which is basically the opposite of his role in D.S. His performance was clearly one of a soon to be great Hollywood actor.

Felicity Huffman? Alcoholic mother whose husband needs a swift kick in the ass. She delivered a vibrant performance and is clearly too great of an actress to be on the small screen. (In my own opinion, I'd prefer her to leave Desperate Housewives and continue acting on the big screen.) My thoughts as the credits began to role? ""Wow, this was...fantastic."" I would recommend this to anyone whose had trouble with a spouse, abuse, or even issues in high school. Its an all around good movie."

Permalink",False,"Okay, so the previews to this film only tells you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to straighten out. That is actually not the case! It's about a young rebellious 17 year old girl who reveals a secret and it's up to her mother to believe if she's telling the truth or not.

To be honest, I really enjoyed the concept of this movie. They had a really good plot and a really good theme of a love/hate relationship between mother and daughter. I did not however, enjoyed watching Lindsay Lohan's acting. In reality, this movie would have been GREAT if they had someone else, perhaps a better actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and it sort of reminds us of the real Lindsay so it takes away a lot from the film.

I do however, think that if you put Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this film. The ending is pretty great (and sad).

Permalink",False,"Hollywood just can't get Red States, and it's almost pathetic to watch Hollywood's efforts to understand them. The idea of Jane Fonda playing an honest woman in Idaho is outrageous. Robert Redford, in ""The Horse Whisperer"", had the good sense to cast Dianne Wiest in the same role as Jane Fonda ostensibly played here. Jane Fonda's no Dianne Wiest. Or how about Dermot Mulroney, who plays the only acceptable male role? But he's lost and almost gay. Just like the guy who played a Mormon was no Mormon.

In this sense, Georgia Rule is all wrong. Garry Marshall is trying to do better than Robert Redford. Marshall fails. Marshall should have stuck to facile, urban, young girl comedy. He can do it, and do it well. There's an underlying, base plot about child abuse that is on, then off and then on again. Do we believe the accusations? Finally, I lost interest - I was too confused. (I can appreciate the nuance of Polanski directing Dunaway in Chinatown, but not Marshall directing Lohan in Georgia Rule.)

Nevertheless, I liked this movie, and I enjoyed watching it. I wasn't bored. Marshall knows how to direct, and make an entertaining movie."

Jane Fonda gave an excellent performance and I know her father Henry Fonda would not have liked the story. It is about a spoiled brat who spend part of the summer with her grandmother played by Jane Fonda. The story just drags on and in my opinion it has sex as the attention getting story line. What a change from the writers of year ago when they had the ability to write a good, interesting story with a solid subject line. My recommendation would be to pass this by and watch Fonda in great stories like On Golden Pond, where it was an excellent performance and a great story. Skip this one and save your money.

I expected very good performances by Jane Fonda and Felicity Hoffman but I was overwhelmed by what an excellent actress Lindsay Lohan is. The tabloid stories about her private life can affect a person's reaction to her acting and that is a shame. I pray that her private life doesn't ruin her professional life. I also thought the film was a little ""too busy"" - almost too many sub-plots going on. I don't think the film was a comedy but instead a very serious drama. If anything, the comedy sections helped to lighten up the intenseness of the story.

Permalink",False,"I've been chewing over ""georgia rule"" for quite a while now and I just can't get over how bad it was. Normally, to say nothing about something horrid, is the best course of action. But I have to get my disgust in this (and I was stuck on a plane with nothing else to do) mess off my chest! ""georgia rule"" (and especially lindsay lohan) is miserable and I'm putting it very mildly.

Look, I have no opinion on actors/actresses (you won't think that after this). I take all actors/actresses for the value of their current body of work and am very open to changing my mind for the movie at hand (as we all know good actors/actresses can pick junk and jerks can pick good films/parts to play). In the case of Jane Fonda, for instance, that includes many films. I'm not a fan of hers, but I respect Jane Fonda's work. In the case of lindsay lohan, this is the second item that I've seen (A Prairie Home Companion was the first film). For lohan, I feel this commentary is going to rail against her. For several of the other actors/actresses, I've seen many of their films - and they all met or exceeded past performances that I've seen.

This piece of junk (""georgia rule"") was horrid. I've never seen anything so pointless and bad. Despite reasonable performances by Jane Fonda, Dermot Mulroney, Cary Elwes (just a few minutes) and more. ""georgia rules"" is pointless and a complete waste of time.

Again, this is going to sound like a rant, but there were many moments where I tried to get into the movie. But then I saw lindsay lohan try to ""act"". She was so bad, that those moments were quickly and very adeptly , as if by design, ground to micro dust by her lack of acting. No matter what the cast around her desperately tried to do, they couldn't save this. And in more than a couple situations Jane Fonda really did try her best to salvage this mess.

What a terrible mess ms lindsay lohan created in this ""thing on celluloid"" (to call or in any way refer to ""georgia rule"" as a movie is to insult everyone in the movie industry - all the way back to the silent film era). lohan came across as a miserable, dislikeable and distraught being. Sort of like the news clippings have portrayed her over the last year or so. I guess she didn't have to act for that, did she? Save yourself and watch the History Channel, CNN or Nick at night etc... Whatever you do, don't buy, rent or even (as in my case) watch it for free when you're a captive audience. Even for free, when you're Xthousand feet in the air. This ""thing on celluloid"" isn't worth the time."

Permalink",False,"This movie had a stellar cast and is excellently written, directed and acted.

Given Lindsay Lohan's personal problems during the making of movie, that is a testament to everyone's conviction. In fact, Ms. Lohan was almost fired. The producers apparently had to send her a letter warning her that if she didn't shape up, she'd have to ship out.

This is really shocking and explains how bad Lohan's addictions are. Any actor who has the chance to work with the likes of Fonda should be thanking their lucky stars, to say the least.

I also heard that Fonda herself showed up at Lohans' trailer and told her to get her butt in gear -- because the crew was waiting for her! Yay for Jane! Too bad it didn't have a lasting impact.

Nonetheless, it is always a pleasure to see Fonda and Huffman -- Lohan is a good actor herself. Now if she could just get her ""act"" together!"

Permalink",False,"I vaguely remember avoiding this movie when it first came out because it was marketed as a comedy/romance. I had seen Jane Fonda in ""Monster-in-Law"" and was completely bored to tears. Not that I don't like Jane Fonda, I just don't care for that sort of film. I figured this one was simply a follow up.

Forgetting all about the film name and not even noticing Jane Fonda in the cast, I came across it on one of the premium channels and decided to watch it. The summary was about a troubled teenager from California being sent to live with her overbearing grandmother in Idaho and soon starts revealing family secrets.

What I found was a very stylized and entertaining drama.

Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) is the troubled California (San Francisco) teen. She's just graduated from high school and is supposed to go college in the fall. Her mother and stepfather can't deal with her so they ship her off to grandma (Georgia, played by Jane Fonda) in Idaho. Actually, her mom, Lilly (Felicity Huffman), drives her most of the way but in the opening scene, there is a fight where Rachel decides to walk the rest of the way. By the time Rachel gets to grandma's house, Lilly has already had her fill of Georgia and has left. Georgia is a woman who lives by rules. If you take the ""Lord's name in vain,"" you have to eat soap. Anything she considers important is called a ""Georgia Rule."" Hence,the title of the film.

Rachel is an extremely troubled girl. She flaunts her sexuality around town, raising eyebrows. She seduces a young Mormon by giving him oral sex. When the town vet (Simon, played by Dermot Mulroney) doesn't respond to her flaunting herself, she initially concludes he is gay.

Now, in some contexts, some of the scenes are comical. Harlan (Garrett Hedlund) takes Rachel to meet his Mormon future-wife-to-be June (Chelse Swain). This is probably a little ""over the top"" and even satirical dealing with Mormonism and sexuality. Hence it could be classed as comedy. However, it seems to play out very seriously and with a degree of believability.

During a casual conversation with Simon, Rachel portrays herself as a ""survivor"" since her stepfather (Arnold, played by Cary Elwes) started molesting her when she was 12.

Simon tells this to Georgia who tells it to Lilly who then leaves Arnold and comes home to mom. Arnold also arrives pleading reconciliation. From then on, the tenor of the film changes to strictly drama with no semblance of comedy or romance. The key question is whether Rachael is lying because she resents being sent away for the summer or if Arnold is really a monster.

The interaction of the characters is highly charged and this is where spoilers might be required in any review so I'm going to sidestep going into details and/or opinions. This is where you are going to enjoy and appreciate the film. And, up until the ending, you're probably going to have trouble making up your mind."

Permalink",False,"I have to admit, I went into this movie thinking the worst. I am NOT a fan of Lindsey Lohan as a person or actress. Honestly I only started watching this movie to get it off my DVR. I was shocked when I actually started enjoying it, and like a good novel, i couldn't wait until the end to see how it all ""wrapped up."" The story is far from a comedy; it's all about personal demons and how three women in a family deal with those demons. Lindsey Lohan is actually good, and Jane Fonda is wonderful. It's a tad bit hokey in parts, and pokes some fun at small town living, but that isn't to say that at least some of the portrayals aren't accurate.

My only warnings would be that this movie is rated R so remember that, there is a lot of crude sexual behavior, but nothing too smutty. Give it a chance, put aside any feelings you have for Lohan and you just might enjoy yourself.

Permalink",False,"Lindsay Lohan plays a character whom seems like the spitting image of herself. She plays Rachel, a spoiled teen from California whose into drugs and sex and lying. It is very reminiscent of Lohan's own real life. Rachel is sent to live with her Grandma for the summer. She's glad to be away from her alcoholic mother, Lilly. She stirs up trouble in town with a local boy, Harlen, whom already has a girl, but she can't resist to try to seduce him. She also acts needy toward her boss, veterinarian Simon. She wants him to hold her and even tries to climb in bed with him when staying over. She thinks she can seduce any man. She makes a revelation to Simon that her stepfather molests her. Half the film is whether or not her mom believes her or her husband. It's hard for her to trust Rachel since Rachel has told so many lies. The predicament leads her mom to start drinking. It gets resolved in the end as to who is telling the truth.

The title refers to one of the grandma's favorite sayings which is ""Georgia Rule"". She always says we eat at 6, Georgia Rule or no swearing, Georgia Rule.

FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but it is hard to like anything with Lohan in it because you know she has had it all, but decided to do drugs and who knows what else in real life, so she is not likable on screen."

Still, Lohan moves this movie. At the beginning of the movie what was going on was obvious to me, so i thought, but then I began to doubt it. Finally, it turns out that my initial conception of what was going on was true. This is a strength of this movie, because the doubting of whether or not I was right in the first place kept me engaged.

The character of the vet was also perfect for this role.

Therefore, don't go into this movie with high expectations but go in for an enjoyable, thought-provoking movie.

The three women at the core of this story fully dissolve in their characters, fully investing their personal life history and experience into roles that in retrospect appear to be practically written for them, especially for Lohan and Fonda. A sensitive yet not depressing approach to serious issues of love and the abuse of love, and how it affects a family and in this case especially the mother/daughter relationships. Georgia Rule goes deeper and looks at morals, tolerance, and how we as a society impact lives and the relationships of others. A movie that is well worth seeing, and worth remembering.

Permalink",False,"Like the drunken uncle who embarrasses himself at family picnics, ""Georgia Rule"" is hard to love but impossible to ignore. The movie has charm and beauty, but its overwrought plot and strange mixture of melodrama and slapstick distracts from its grace.

Lindsay Lohan, an actress who in many ways resembles the aforementioned uncle, plays Rachel, a wild child from California sent by her alcoholic mother (Felicity Huffman) to live with her grandmother Georgia (Jane Fonda) in Utah. Rachel is grating at first, a foul foil to Georgia's prissy prude. As her character develops, we gain insight into her rebelliousness, as well as respect for Lohan for pulling it off. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Fonda, who followed up her disappointing role in ""Monster in Law"" with another one-note character that will leave her fans yearning for the days when her roles truly mattered.

The film follows the expected path of the family fighting and the family making up, but it also takes some interesting and odd detours along the way. Like most detours, not all of them lead anywhere, but they still make the trip worthwhile. The film's overacted and overwritten scenes weigh heavily on ""Georgia Rule,"" but like your drunken uncle, it can't just be ignored. Whether you want it to or not, it grows on you."

Permalink",False,"Despite the harsh relationship shown first among the three women (mother, daughter and granddaughter) with so cruel words each one tells the other two, love finishes to prevail because it's there. It may prove that love is always there among close members of the same family even when personal behaviour, family upbringing or even social conditions tend to separate them and make them to hate each other. And this is a predominantly feminine movie since female characters are here much more important than men's and very well performed by the three actresses with special prominence to Jane Fonda in one of the best roles of her career as the granddaughter who tries to impose strict rules to her ill behaved daughter and granddaughter. Though we don't see here a particularly deep psychological analysis of characters we can say the movie is honest and true in the sense that there is nothing implausible in the story or the characters and that it could happen to any of us or to our families in this society of ours where moral freedom and permissiveness is the rule. Remarkable is also the contrast between the behaviour of the Californian girl and the puritanical standards of the little rural town in Idaho and the scandal caused by the former. This movie is not a masterpiece but can be rated as a good one."

An embarrassing mishmash, Lindsey elicits NO sympathy, since in the first ten minutes she plays herself up as a slut. By the middle of the movie she is having a 'popsicle party' with Garrett Hedlund's character, trying to seduce Dermot Mulroney (I wanted his character to be Rachel's REAL dad..would have added to the repulsiveness of it all), and trying to convince his girlfriend that nothing happened, all while wearing a peasant blouse that showed off most of her cleavage. Now, Jane Fonda's return to the screen with 'Monster In Law' was funny enough, but she must have been desperate to earn a paycheck. She is unfunny, unsympathetic, and annoying. You prayed she would pull out her costume from 'Barbarella' and team up with Lindsey to sleep with most of Idaho. Felicity Huffman, coming off of her triumph in 'Transamerica', chews the scenery as if she was intoxicated throughout the entire film. Cary Elwes, light years from 'The Princess Bride' is a waste, and one wonders why someone as self centered as his character would try to molest someone like Rachel's character, even though it appears the molestation made her a slut. Garry Marshall should have called it 'Pretty Women: 17 Years Later'...it might have actually made money.

Permalink",False,"Garry Marshall is highly regarded for his style in pulling of sophisticated comedies ('Pretty Woman', 'The Other Sister', 'Beaches', 'Frankie and Johnny' etc) and for this film he selected a script by an equally respected writer, Mark Andrus ('As Good as it Gets', Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood', 'Life as a House'). To add to this assured formula he managed to cast some fine actors, and so the audience is left wondering 'What happened?' Most people would judge the cover of this DVD to represent a full-blooded comedy. But that is the first blunder. What happens in this film is the examination of a severely dysfunctional family of women: Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) is an oversexed 17 year old tyrant whose alcoholic mother Lilly (Felicity Huffman) can no longer tolerate and ships her miscreant daughter off to the 'hell world' of Lilly's distant controlling mother Georgia (Jane Fonda) to shape Rachel up for college. Georgia of the many rules and rigid lifestyle lives in Idaho and Rachel arrives and immediately plies her bad personality on the folks of the little town, including seducing a soon-to-be Mormon evangelist Harlan (Garrett Hedlund) and shocking the little boys who are cared for by Georgia. Georgia gets Rachel a job as an office girl for Dr. Ward (Dermot Mulroney) who is an ex-lover of Lilly but a role model for the town since his wife and son's accidental death. Rachel decides to get back at her mother and her stepfather Arnold (Cary Elwes) by explaining her misbehavior to Simon: her stepfather sexually abused her from age 12 to 14. In an attempt to help Rachel's family heal, Simon informs Georgia who informs Lilly about the abuse and Lilly responds by leaving Arnold to return to Idaho, cut her hair, and give in to drinking wholeheartedly. Was Lilly's confession true or fabricated? This question serves as the climax that brings about changes in everyone. The point is dulled by the fact that we never really care about any of these involved characters, so shallow is the writing that could have salvaged a story by fleshing out potentially interesting characters.

The cast is so good that they give it their all to try to save this sinking ship of a film. We want to praise Fonda and Huffman but their roles simply don't allow the actors to go very far. Marshall has worked with many of these actors before (even Hector Elizondo is given a very tiny part!) but this time the cake doesn't rise. Worth viewing for the opportunity to see some very good actors given a few moments of valid screen time. Grady Harp"

Lindsay is the best actress of are time. every one should see this movie. the movie is so different from her other movies. its with out a doubt the best movie i saw all year. every one i talked to loves this movie. i think she should win an Oscar for this movie. as soon as it come out on video I'm buying it. every one who see's this movie will think the Lindsay is the most beautiful women in the world. academy awards should give all the awards to Lindsay. Lindsay is perfect and anyone who disagrees is jealous.Lindsay Morgan Lohan was born in New York City on July 2, 1986. Her mother Dina is a former Radio City ""Rockette"" while her father Michael was a long-time Wall Street trader before he struck it rich with a family pasta business. He has now redirected his energies into film development and producing.Every generation has its share of emerging stars and Lindsay Lohan is proving to be just that. In only a few years, she has become an idol for teenage girls everywhere and a pinup for their male counterparts. Lindsay is aware of this and it has apparently gone to her head. Even though she's very much involved in a number of charities, we can't help but subtract points from her otherwise impressive record. Along with her three younger siblings, Michael, Aliana and Dakota, Lindsay was raised in Long Island. Lindsay was such a natural beauty that she began modeling at the age of 3. In fact, she was the first redheaded child ever signed by the renowned Ford Modeling Agency. But Lindsay Lohan wasn't just a pretty child; she was also talented. Capitalizing on her flair for performing, she was cast in over 60 TV commercials for companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch One of 2004's youngest ""It"" girls could soon be seen everywhere, from hosting Saturday Night Live in May and the MTV Movie Awards in June 2004, to appearing in magazines and tabloid TV shows. In 2005, Lindsay Lohan can add the movies Herbie: Fully Loaded (another Disney flick), Gossip Girl and Fashionistas to her resume. And she's staying busy well into 2007, with the release of I Dream of Jeannie in 2006 and Dramarama the following year. As if Hollywood success weren't enough, Lindsay seems to be setting out to become a triple threat with the release of her debut album Speak in December 2004. But when she performed ""Rumors"" -- the first single off the album -- on Good Morning America, rumors began to swirl that she lip-synced, because there was a backing track playing. When she's not on a movie set or at a photo shoot, Lindsay enjoys spending her free time roller blading, swimming, doing gymnastics, and, according to tabloids, partying the night away."

In fact, I don't know anyone that has gone to see ANY of Lindsay's recent movies. I rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career, until she cleans up her act. All of the recent publicity has only hindered her movie making career, if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies

Up to this time, movie producers have actively sought Lindsay for roles in their upcoming production. Now, Lindsay will probably have to go to auditions & actually compete for ANY role. Her reputation is currently ""poison"" & quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is in.

Sooooo....now Lindsay is going to have to deal with ""not being wanted"".....is she going to be able to handle this?

I wonder if even Jay Leno will want to have Lindsay back on his TV Show?

Permalink",True,"The all-star melodrama, ""Georgia Rule,"" provides us with three generations of women who have never figured out how to get along with one another. Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) is a spoiled, out-of-control teenager from California whose increasingly desperate mother, Lilly (Felicity Huffman), ships her off to a small town in Idaho to spend the summer with her slightly eccentric grandmother, Georgia (Jane Fonda), a woman for whom Lilly herself has nothing but the deepest contempt. After some initial tension between the two generational bookends, Georgia manages to break through Rachel's hard outer shell and uncover the good person within, all the while instilling the values of hard work, discipline and mutual respect into a girl woefully lacking in each of those qualities.

As written by Mark Andrus, ""Georgia Rule"" is a largely unconvincing comedy/drama that bites off considerably more than it can chew in terms of both drama and theme. Even though the movie thinks it's being wise about the ways of human nature, many of the script's observations on familial relationships wouldn't pass muster in a Psychology 101 course. Each character is given her own distinctive quirk or eccentricity - Georgia is an inflexible stickler for rules, Lilly is a bitter alcoholic, Rachel is a pathological liar - and a pat explanation for why she is like she is, but none of it rings particularly true or convincing. The movie delves into such dark areas as child molestation and alcoholism, but neither Andrus nor director Garry Marshall displays the subtlety or depth of insight necessary to pull such material off. Too often, they go for the grand, corny, over-the-top gesture when an understated moment would do. Moreover, the small-town characters who surround the leads lack a sense of authenticity, adding to the whole Hollywood-comes-to-Boise feel of the piece.

The acting is fine, though hardly spectacular (Lohan is occasionally annoying, but then, since her character is supposed to be annoying, I guess that's not really much of a criticism), but even the performers can't help the movie stand up under the weight of contrivance and self-importance that ultimately crushes in on it.

Permalink",False,"Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) is a mess and forced to stay with her grandmother Georgia (Jane Fonda) in Idaho for the summer before college. She has trouble with her mother Lilly (Felicity Huffman) and gets left at the side of the road. Lilly doesn't get along with her mother Georgia either and can't wait to go home to San Fransico. Georgia is religious and has strict Georgia Rules. Rachel flirts with Harlan (Garrett Hedlund) and has oral sex with the Mormon. She gets a job at Simon (Dermot Mulroney) the vet who is still struggling with the death of his wife and baby. Rachel reveals to Simon that she had sex with her stepfather Arnold (Cary Elwes) at 12 but later claims it to be a lie. Georgia tells Lilly anyways. Arnold denies it but Lilly comes to get the truth from Rachel.

Garry Marshall is probably the wrong director for this darker material. I think that his natural tendency is comedy and that's a problem. The cast is there for the dark material. Lohan fits this role very well. Fonda doesn't fit quite as well. However the comedy attempts don't fit and conflict badly. There is something that is too dysfunctional to be in a comedy and I think child abuse is it."

Permalink",True,"After this, I said ""WAW, what a beautiful script!"". I ran to the internet to see who wrote it, to discover that he is (Mark Andrus), the very scriptwriter who gave us before (As Good as It Gets). The drama has excellent victories; it's a movie about what's real and what's a lie. It begins with a lie, and ends with a truth. Almost all the characters are deprived of love, and escaping from facing the truth is the main reason why; e.g. (Dermot Mulroney) stopped laughing after the death of his wife, (Felicity Huffman) drinks because she misses compassion for all of her life, (Jane Fonda) lives alone because she never expresses her feeling of love.. etc. Add to that : catchy and so wise lines, funny antics (Jane's soap for one), and how everybody is being influenced by the other; e.g. (Lindsay Lohan) exposes the truth of (Mulroney)'s sadness to himself, getting – with her aggressive attitude – the delayed money from his patients, while, on the other hand, he teaches her the lesson of ""if you can't trust, you can't love"".

(Mulroney)'s portrayal of that depressed doctor is more like being reborn. Some actors don't get the quality mark before hitting their forties I believe. Now, a lot of middle-aged characters are waiting for him to be acted memorably. (Fonda) played a play on her real-life father (Henry Fonda) (who didn't have the best relationship with his daughter). Ironically enough, (Jane) plays a role too similar to one (Henry) himself played with her in (On Golden Pond), where she was the ignored daughter (in the movie and reality). So it was like art imitating life that has been imitated by art before, to see (Jane) in her story; yet once as the daughter, then as the father-turned-mother this round. Anyway, she hit a new degree of proficient, giving a ripened acting, looking so young along the way as well! Though, many would hate that ""though"", the winner was (Huffman). She had the best part; with many alterations, more pains, delivering a bit better performance than (Jane)'s, topping everybody else in this movie. So, glad with the script, the cast I was. Not the same can be said about (Garry Marshall)'s direction !

(Marshall) doesn't have a respectively deep look into how to embody relationships, affections, emotions, or simply any special, no comic, moment on screen. He started by directing episodes of sitcoms like (The Odd Couple), (Mork & Mindy). Then, at his film career, he never had an opportunity to show off his capacities as a serious drama master. He used to make light comedies like (Overboard, The Princess Diaries, Raising Helen). And in his close to drama ones like (Nothing in Common, Beaches, and – naturally – Georgia Rule) he couldn't prove any uniqueness. Yes, I admit that acting and comedy are perfect in his movies, moreover he's capable of handing in a lovely image, making entertaining movies altogether. However, deepness isn't his thing, and he deals with the serious drama as easy romantic comedy !

This is exactly the problem here. He took a lot of this movie's intrinsic splendor by leading everything spiritlessly or in a usual manner at best. The way the cast moves is lazy, the camera doesn't utilize any background creatively, the image is mute. While the performances are strong, the editing deformed a lot of the moments, degrading them into the traditional ""sigh"" moments in sitcoms. It was too hasty or too mechanic; as if the plan was making all the shots with one length ! A scene like ""Did you ever love me?"" between (Jane Fonda) and (Felicity Huffman) was brutally murdered. That was the wrong way to do it. It messed, like many other scenes, the warmth existing in the script. I felt rather no feeling from that directing towards the story in the first place! Thank god for the script, the way how (Marshall) could bring the best out of his cast, and conduct their comic moments brilliantly. Otherwise it would have been completely cold and banal.

Casting (Cary Elwes) exposed big part of the surprise about his character. He had an obvious dirty weasel written all over his face. Choosing him in that character made it predicable. I hated how (Lohan) was pictured as Femme Fatal. Her body was mostly awful (The top : a woman. The rest : a child !). So with her fine performance, I always felt something untruthful and wrong. Also, the sexual stuff was too much. (Lohan)'s character was sleeping with everybody like it's a long sex party. From my point of view, the movie didn't need any of that (Oral sex ? Really ?!). Maybe they were the wheels in (Lohan)'s vehicle as a new sex goddess that this movie was meant to be (an already broken vehicle if you asked me!). Then, the marketing of the movie, OH GOD, Hollywood had taught the whole world how to sell, but they failed in selling this?! To say the least, an addict of movies' trailers, such as me, didn't run into even a teaser for this movie anywhere, while all the ""brainless"" movies had / have all the possible publicity all the time at everywhere !

This script is like walking on the moon. With that direction; it's fake moon! Well, (Georgia Rule) just yearned for less simplistic director, to be more arty, distinguished and effective. But ultimately it somehow works, even if as a movie-of-the-week, being a breath of fresh air while burning weather of remakes, sequels, superhero flicks and toilet comedies. Yes, boys and girls out there, there is something named drama, and it has its own movies too !

Permalink",False,"The movie is about the strained relationship between three women: daughter, mother, grandmother.

The plot is interesting and complex enough. Rachel is a rebellious California city girl sent to live with her Grandmother in small town Mormon country (for some reason Idaho, not Utah) because the mother can't control her. She lies a lot and seems to be promiscuous. She attempts to manipulate the men in the town. One, a vet who also treats people, turns out to have had a long ago relationship with Rachel's mother. Her mother had her own conflicts with the Grandmother. Rachel tells people that her father-in-law had molested her, providing an explanation for her bad behavior. But is she lying or telling the truth? Sometimes she says it is a lie she made up and other times claims it is real.

But something just doesn't click with the film. Maybe it is a bad script, bad acting, or (most likely) bad directing. The director, Gary Marshall, is best known for lighter comedies.

Jane Fonda plays her part well, but Lindsay Lohan's performance is questionable. She looks the part, but says her lines in a lackluster manner. Felicity Huffman tends to ham up a little the boozy mother parts. Cary Elwes is very good but, while his character is important to the plot, he isn't on the screen till the end and then not that much.

Still, I was interested enough in the movie to see the whole film."

Permalink",False,"An spoiled, rude but bright young teenager Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) is forced to live with my grandmother Georgia (Oscar-Winner:Jane Fonda) for the summer. Which she hasn't seen in years, because Rachel's alcoholic mother Lilly (Felicity Huffman) can't control her daughter anymore. Since Lilly has an problem of her own as well. Rachel discovers that her grand-mother has very strict house rules and her grand-mother already find a job for her grand-daughter. Which Rachel is forced to work with a veterinarian doctor Simon Ward (Dermot Mulroney), who secretly treats people as well. Also Rachel has an eye on a handsome yet extremely shy young man Harlan (Garrett Hedlund). But the trouble starts when Rachel tells Simon that she was sexually abused by her step-father Arnold (Cary Elwes). Which Simon tells Georgia about it, she believes it's true. But when Georgia tells the story to her daughter Lilly, she doesn't believe it's true. Since Rachel is lying most of the time to get out of trouble. Now Georgia, Rachel and Lilly are together face to face. These three woman have to face the hard truth of their pasts for different reasons of what when wrong in their lives.

Directed by Garry Marshall (Frankie and Johnny, Overboard, Pretty Woman) made an fairly interesting dramatic comedy about the difficult relationships of family members. Fonda, Lohan and Huffman offers good performances here. The movie does have its moments of comedy and strong moments of drama but the problem is with the film is never really convincing. The script by Mark Andrus (As Good as It Gets, Late for Dinner, Life as a House) is part of the major problem with the picture. The movie never resolves some of the most intriguing sub-plots like the friendship between Rachel and Steve. Which we will find out later that Steve is actually Rachel's real father but Rachel never knows about it in the picture. Although the three leads are good in the movie, their characters are hard to like. Mulroney offers the best performance in the film. But the characters in the picture could have used more fleshing out and the ending doesn't feel satisfying as we would liked it to be. It's too light for the serious subject matter to be taken seriously in the movie sadly. This is one of Marshall's misfire movies that manages to be watchable. It's above average fare, fans of the three leads might be more forgiven with the odd-story turns of this picture. Panavision. (***/*****)."

Permalink",True,"This film presents an extended family which has some problems: problems of emotional rigidity, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, sexual abuse, statutory rape, compulsive sexual behavior, religious differences, cultural differences, serious personality disorders, grief for a dead spouse and all this mixed with just the usual adolescence.

And all these problems can be resolved with a few chats, a few tears and few heartfelt hugs.

Not at all a comedy, this is an attempt at drama that is as subtle as a hand grenade.

There are some scenes and moments of magic when the acting succeeds despite the absurd script. However none of the magic is produced by Jane Fonda who should now pretend she has never heard of this film.

Permalink",True,"The only decent professional critical review of Georgia Rule I could find appeared in The New York Times (written by A.O. Scott, I believe). All of the others I read seemed to treat the film like a punching bag upon which to vent unrelated psychological baggage. In other words, I found its reception to be quite unfair. I think this movie was an easy target for lazy critics because it was so odd. It couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a lighthearted comedy or melodrama or a sleeper-character-driven-indie-style flick or B-trash or what. So its rhythm is a bit awkward. Given its tonal whimsy, this film should have sucked to the point of being unwatchable. But it didn't. Lindsay Lohan's performance was stellar. Her character was fully drawn and she worked it flawlessly. Jane Fonda was also compelling but her character could have been better developed. And Felicity Huffman was competent enough.

I know that the film's subject was taken as offensive by some. Since it was so wrongly advertised, I didn't know going in what the movie was going to be about. I was surprised to learn that its theme revolved around the surrounding character's perceptions of Rachel's (Lohan) cynicism, rebelliousness and hypersexuality. Its trailers promised a story of an unruly teenager sent to her strict, god-fearing grandmother's house to gain some much needed discipline. As advertised, the comedy was supposed to rely on the conflict between the two characters, which would ultimately be resolved when young Rachel learned some respect. Instead, Grandma discovers the fullness of Rachel's character and sympathizes with her. No serious discipline ever really takes place. Unless you count the scene when Georgia (Fonda) beats up a car with a baseball bat. But even then, the much-deserved discipline is directed toward a relatively minor character (Cary Elwes) that is revealed to be ultimately responsible for Rachel's turbulent behavior.

Yeah, Georgia Rule has its problems. In addition to its indecisive awkwardness of pace and tone, the male characters are pretty flat and they occupy time that could have been better spent developing the Huffman and Fonda characters. Cary Elwes was especially poor as Rachel's stepfather. He played the role clownishly, as if he was mocking his character. He seemed almost uncomfortable. His performance kept assuring viewers that he was only acting, that he would never, in reality, be such a bad person. Good for him. But his unwillingness to play the role straight and believably hurt the film. Fortunately his screen time is limited. So overall, the movie was worth the two hours and ten bucks or so.

I'm sure when you decided to watch this movie you were not expecting some deep drama filled with dark secrets. The story this movie tells is real and unpredictable. This is the type of movie that makes you sit until the end to find out what happens. I prefer books over movies half of the time for obvious reasons but this is truly a wonderful story to watch.

Permalink",True,"Garry Marshall directs this movie with three top actresses, but seems to let so much potential slip away. A film about redemption and forgiveness and a lot of independence. Some of the banter is hilarious. But a lot of the dialog leads to the dark-side of life. Lilly(Felicity Huffman)with plenty of issues and demons is forced to take her rebellious daughter Rachel(Lindsay Lohan)to the place she swore never to go again...to her mother's home. Georgia(Jane Fonda) is not your typical little granny. She lives her life by a number of demanding rules, with God coming first and hard work second. This summer might be the perfect place for Rachel, a hottie that is hotter than hot. She turns the heads of this tiny Mormon town and single handedly corrupts a young man(Cary Elwes) who is smitten with her. Deeply buried family secrets come to light; but Simon(Dermont Mulroney), one of Lily's former boyfriends may just be the cohesive thread that helps these three women come back together again. Lohan is a down right naughty girl and provides most of the rated R material. You can't fault a girl for that. Fonda is really outstanding. Huffman's potential isn't even touched. This movie could have been a lot better; but take it for what it is...entertaining.

Lindsay killed her performance with her wit and sassyness, I adored Felicity Huffman shes is such a great actress and Jane Fonda wasn't as outstanding in this but still played her role perfectly.

I thought it conveyed issues that are faced by society that plague generations of families; we all in reality reflect our parents in a sense. Lindsay's wardrobe was just stunning. I want everything she has :)
