Permalink",True,"Julianne Moore's character of Alice Howland has to face that eventuality in the wonderful, heart-breaking movie ""Still Alice."". Alice is a 50-year-old woman with a charmed life. She is happily married to Dr. John Howland, played by Alec Baldwin. Their son, Tom is training to be a doctor, daughter, Anna is married, pregnant with twins, and a lawyer, youngest daughter, Lydia played by Kristen Stewart who has matured as an actress since the ""Twilight"" series, is an aspiring actress. All of the performers are great, but Kristen Stewart surprised me the most and she broke the Bella Swan type-cast trap. In her job as a language professor, Alice needs her brain in order to give lectures and write books. When her brain basically craps out on her during a lecture at the college, Alice is confused by why her sharp mind has suddenly failed her. Alice's memory lapses have her confused and upset. She goes to a neurologist who tests her memory. After much testing, the doctor says Alice has an inherited form of Alzheimer's disease she got from her late father. He tells her to have her children tested to see if their late grandfather gave them the faulty gene. Anna tests positive for the gene, Tom tests negative, and stubborn Lydia refuses to take the test. In the end, Alice gets worse and worse. Her twin grandson and granddaughter are healthy, but it is heart-breaking their grandmother won't remember them. Lydia takes up the reins as her mother's caregiver and the most heart-wrenching thing about the movie is how much this horrible disease takes away so much from its victims.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice is a realistic and emotional story of a woman living with Alzheimer's disease. Julianne Moore successfully shows the struggle, confusion, anger, pain and isolation of having such a disease through her incredible performance. She allows the audience to see what having Alzheimer's could possibly be like. This film also has an amazing screenplay, a screenplay that is raw and honest. There is also a great ensemble performance from the cast, featuring Alec Baldwin as the supportive and loving husband. The movie definitely makes the viewer think deeply about aspects of life such as memories, family, loss and bewilderment which are all addressed in Still Alice. See this film for a moving story, but mostly for Moore's miraculous performance. It wouldn't be a surprise if she won Best Actress in the upcoming Academy Awards.

Permalink",False,"It probably goes without saying, but in my opinion ""Still Alice"" is right up there among this year's best pictures.

And what ultimately makes author Lisa Genova's debut bestselling novel so personal, yet so universal and identifiable in it's messages, are the performances. Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart are a part of a strong supporting cast, that will leave a lasting impression in your mind and it will be more than deserved. Both of their characters were so real - warm, supportive and earthly. And while both Baldwin and Stewart have taken the occasional misstep in their respective pasts, both of them once again showed without a doubt their acting abilities and scope, a word linguistics professor Dr. Alice Howland used, albeit with great difficulties, to describe her daughter Lydia (played by Stewart) in one point of the film.

And what a performance by Julianne Moore that was! She essentially made an already rich character in Alice, a frankly too young Alzheimer's disease patient, who also happens to be a renown linguistics professor, even more dimensional and rich. Moore's Alice is a strong, intelligent woman when we first meet her at her birthday at the beginning of the film. At that moment, Moore is confident and full of purpose. As she gets diagnosed with a rare form of Alzheimer's disease, that her children might have inherited from her, and time goes by, Alice becomes a shadow of herself, whose mental health deteriorates at an alarmingly fast rate. And that is the part that Moore portrayed with such skill and graceful pain, that the viewer can't help but get irreversibly emotionally involved with her character. We feel for her, we cry with her, we wish she would get better, although it is clear that is sadly not going to happen. And Moore's Alice knows it as well. And that makes the journey through her story even more challenging, difficult and painful for the viewer. Or as Beverly Beckham of The Boston Globe put it ""This is Alice Howland's story, for as long as she can tell it"".

The film was directed and adapted by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, who share both the writing and directing duties on almost all of their projects to date. The two somehow complete each other and find the balance, that is needed to tell such a delicate story in a manner, which can do it proper justice.

I will probably be the only one saying this, but I thought the score was tremendous as well. Kudos goes to composer Ilan Eshkeri, who did an amazing job on the film. The music is often intense and minimalistic, it feels like it is just an addition to the already rich environment the characters find themselves in and I would love to see at least a nomination at the Oscars for Eshkeri, although I highly doubt it.

So, to wrap it up in a nutshell: Still Alice is a wonderful film, an intimate and fascinating study in the field of family drama, and one of the year's best. I definitely hope to see some awards buzz mainly around the cast - both Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart deserve it for their delicate and supportive portrayal of husband John and youngest daughter Lydia, respectively, who never gave up on Moore's Alice. And Julianne Moore - well, what can I say - her brutally sad and honest portrayal of Alice deserves to go down in the books of top-notch acting and she will reap the fruits of her work a long time from now (well, mostly, at the end of February, I hope).

So it is a nine out of ten stars from me, only because I felt there could have been more screen time for the other children in the Howland family, and therefore the film could have been at least 10-15 minutes longer.

But solely on Julianne Moore, Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart's impeccable acting, I say this film is among the very best in the subject and also among the best titles this year.

My grade: 9/10"

Few movies about Alzheimer's show things almost entirely from the perspective of the victim, and even fewer try to grapple with her internal thoughts and feelings as the disease progresses. Still Alice does just that.

Taking an exceptionally verbal and smart person and giving her early onset Alzheimer's and watching how she deals with it and how she feels about it made this an exceptional film. So does the always-excellent Julianne Moore, who outdoes herself in an Oscar-worthy performance.

The movie's full of highlights: the Skypeing between mom and daughter Kristin Stewart, the relatively healthy Julianne leaving a video for her much sicker self to discover; the question only one person asks: ""How does it make you feel?"" And extra credit for the double use of Lyle Lovett's ""If I Had a Boat."""

Still Alice is a film that touches delicate subject matters, which sometimes don't make for a compelling watch. It's hard to sit down and watch someone suffering from Alzheimer's Disease and witness their slow deterioration as they gradually lose their mind. Somehow, Julianne Moore gives such a powerful performance that makes this delicate theme worth your while. She carries this film, and elevates it from your standard mental illness movie. Julianne Moore is on the top of her game and following her strong performance in Maps to the Stars, she delivers an authentic portrayal of a woman trying to come to grips with her terrible diagnosis. The film intelligently centers on her in a very authentic way instead of focusing on the rest of her family, like so many films tend to do when the character has hit rock bottom with their mental disease. As the title suggests, the focus is on Alice and her character is fully developed even when she is at her lowest. As an audience we sometimes tend to look away or find ways to ignore people with mental illness, and many films do so by focusing on the reaction of the rest of the family or on the loved ones as if the main character has lost his or her personality. But we are reminded in this film that Alice is still Alice, and Julianne Moore makes sure we come to grips with this. Julianne Moore will probably be nominated for her lead performance here and it wouldn't surprise me if she wins her first Oscar after her fifth nomination. She is long overdue.

It's no surprise that this film was delivered in such an authentic way when you take into consideration that the co-director, Richard Glatzer, suffers from ASL and can't speak himself. If a film wants to deliver a powerful and empathetic film about mental illness, then there is no better way to do so than having someone who is experiencing this first hand. Glatzer, who has co-directed his previous films with Wash Westmoreland, reunites with him once again co-writing the adapted screenplay from Lisa Genova's novel. I know the issue has been explored many times before and one could assume it enters familiar territory, but Moore's portrayal of the character makes this film stand out from others. For people who have gone through similar issues with a family member or close friend, Still Alice hits home, but it does so in a compassionate way. It reminds us how fragile our minds and life can be. Having Moore play a highly intelligent linguistic professor makes this all the more shocking as we see how she struggles with the disease. The most emotional moment of the film comes when Moore's character is giving a touching speech about how she is dealing with the disease. It was a powerful moment in the movie and Moore deserves all the recognition she's been getting for her performance. Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart both give strong supporting performances as well. The entire film rings true in its exploration of mental illness, and the performances never go over the top. Everything about this film rings true despite the delicate themes that are touched. The subject matter might not be appealing for most audiences and they may find the film tedious, but for me it hits home and I found it to be a compelling drama."

It's hard to put into words why ""Still Alice"" from writer/directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westermoreland is as effective as it is. A cinematic experience that will pull you through the ringer, similar to other tearjerking efforts like ""Terms of Endearment"" or ""Stepmom,"" the film is a heartbreaking measurement of storytelling that is one of the surprising gems of the year. Helmed by a magnificent performance by Julianne Moore, ""Still Alice"" dodges most of the cliché tropes of disease-ridden dramas with spunk and warmth. It's not just about the struggle of Alice (Moore), it's also an in- depth and informative medical drama that not only breaks your heart, but provide valuable information and sensitivity to anyone who may know or will know someone in the future.

The film tells the story of Alice, a brilliant professor that is diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50. Terrified of the future, and the fear of forgetting the life she's created, ""Still Alice"" reflects not only on the ramifications of knowing such knowledge of your eventual demise, but how it affects those who know and love you. If your loved one was stricken with such an illness, would you, rather could you stand by their side no matter what? It's easy to answer with the socially acceptable response until you're faced with such a question.

""Alice"" inhabits a simplicity that almost feels too uncomplicated and transparent to warrant a positive take but alas, here we are. Glatzer and Westermoreland create a sensitive, well-intentioned examination of a woman struggling with early on-set Alzheimer's disease. May sound like shameless, factory-standard Oscar bait, but its unlike any movie you'll see this year, dealing with delicate subject matter in a tender way. They cover different angles of the topic at hand without getting too preachy. Of course, this is mostly due to the brilliance of four-time Academy Award nominee Moore, but she's not the only one on her A-game. Co-star Alec Baldwin, who plays Alice's husband John, showcases one of his most layered portrayals yet. Internalized, disturbed, but very compelling in the way he chooses to execute his feelings. Baldwin's mannerisms and antics have not been put to better use in quite sometime.

Kristen Stewart continues to revitalize her image as an actress. ""Clouds and Sils Maria"" and ""Camp X-Ray"" are terrific examples of her talents put to great use but what she achieves as Lydia, Alice's youngest daughter is nothing short of spectacular. Glatzer and Westermoreland understand her abilities and limitations but heighten them to stunning results. If Stewart continues on this path, she could easily become one of our greatest working actresses. She's certainly one of the most exciting at the moment. Stewart is a gift.

After struggling to find her voice in the movies, Kate Bosworth hits on all cylinders as Anna. As does Hunter Parrish, fondly remembered from ""It's Complicated."" He's aching for his big, breakout role.

I guess it's time to worship the aura of Julianne Moore. It's easy to dismiss my take on her work since I'm unapologetically a Moore enthusiast (loud and proud). Three of her Oscar nominations for ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Far from Heaven,"" and ""The Hours"" are all worthy citations, arguably winning performances that Oscar passed over. I've been able to separate her overall brilliance from some of the choices she's made in roles over the years. ""The English Teacher"" is an attempt to be change it up, ""The Forgotten"" is a horror/mystery that lacks either of those words, and ""The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio"" is wellthat movie from 2005. Julianne Moore is a revelation of epic proportions. Bold, provocative, and emotionally gripping, she delivers one of her strongest performances to date. She's takes a daring stand to be vulnerable, and hits an amazing high. A destined winner of Best Actress.

The film can feel like a factory-standard creation passed over by the TV networks at times, mostly due to the style in which its shot. Cinematographer Denis Lenior keeps things straightforward but isn't adventurous enough to stand out in the crowd. Film Editor Nicolas Chaudeurge should also take a few cues from the playbook of Pietro Scalia, Stephen Mirrione, and Richard Marks, editors that know how to milk a scene for everything its worth. There are moments that will surely create a weep-a-thon in your seat, but there are missed opportunities to really push the audience over the edge. Composer Ilan Eshkeri however, takes his cues from famed musicians like John Williams and Howard Shore to swell the tearducts to maximum capacity.

Overall, ""Still Alice"" is a very rewarding experience, wrapped in a blanket of emotions held by Julianne Moore and Co.. It's one of those rare films that makes you think and gives you a debate to have with your loved ones. A deep, human movie that doesn't shy away from baring its soul and the vast complexities that come with it. Just plain great."

Permalink",False,"Based on Lisa Genova's 2007 bestselling novel of the same name, 'Still Alice' is a saddening, but beautifully made film, that stays on your mind even after it concludes. Its A Well-Made Film with Strong Performances!

'Still Alice' Synopsis: Alice Howland, happily married with three grown children, is a renowned linguistics professor who starts to forget words. When she receives a devastating diagnosis, Alice and her family find their bonds tested.

'Still Alice' is about a women's journey coming to an abrupt end. Richard Glatzer & Wash Westmoreland's Adapted Screenplay is consistently engaging, although difficult to watch, at most times. The protagonist's journey with her family offers moments of pure love & sadness. You feel for the characters & particularly, for Alice. Glatzer & Westmoreland's Direction is under-stated, but impressive. Cinematography captures the bleakness, exceedingly well. Editing is just perfect.

Performance-Wise: Julianne Moore brings Alice to life, with a splendid performance. She becomes Alice & completes her tale, magnificently. Alec Baldwin, as Alice's supportive husband, redefines ""control"" in performance. He's restrained & patient all through. Kristen Stewart, as Alice's rebellious younger daughter, is natural. Kate Bosworth, as Alice's older daughter, is in true form, as well.

On the whole, 'Still Alice' is an experience, that demands to be felt. Two Thumbs up!"

Kristen Stewart and Alec Baldwin also give very good performances and I think that Ms.Stewart successfully shed the ""Twilight"" vampire stereotype.

Just like any disease, your fight is as strong as your support system. Not only Alice's but Julianne Moore's support system is strong as well with a supporting cast of Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin, Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish, and a score that never has the audience wondering about their emotions but has them focused on Alice's.

Permalink",False,"In Hollywood, medical conditions that are devastating in real life are magically transformed into episodes that the leading characters meet with stout resolve, a positive attitude, and a quite, sanitized unseen ending. So it is with this movie.

The main character is diagnosed early in the movie with early-onset Alzheimer's. The rest of the movie is about her gradual decline and her family's reaction to it. There are some interesting possibilities in the plot, such as the pull of the husband's career and the developments of one daughter's career, but they are not developed well and simply look shallow and contrived. The movie ends about where Alzheimer's would become a real strain on the family, but as always with a Hollywood depiction, the tragedy that is to follow is hidden. Real Alzhimer's patients forget who their families are, scream mindlessly about nothing in particular, foul themselves, cannot feed themselves. The bodies are there but the minds are not. The person that once was is gone, but the outward shell is there reminding us what once was and playing havoc with our emotions. Only a sanitized hint of all that is present in this movie.

The dialog is mostly predictable, sometimes overdone and sermonizing. The characters are all shallow, even the main character.

The intention is good. The acting is excellent. The overall execution is weak. Not worth the time unless you enjoy seeing good talent wasted on a weak script."

Permalink",False,"Forgetting something has to be the most annoying and stressful thing that a person could have, but losing your memory by a disease and becoming coming pretty much brain dead is even worse and this movie plays it out very well, because the movie feels real and not fake like other movies that try to do that.

The story is about a Linguistics professor in a loving marriage with three grown children starts to forget certain words. After meeting with a doctor, she receives a devastating diagnosis, one that will test the bonds between her family.

I always love it when a movie that I never know existed could make me glad I saw it and happy that it exists. I'm always looking forward to the big blockbusters that everybody's talking about and wouldn't shut up about. I always look past those kind of movies that are actually pretty than the entertaining blockbuster's and like always I feel like moron for skipping them.

Still Alice has to be the most extraordinary film that I watched this year, in a way that the movie could had scenes where it would have dragged out or slowed down extremely, but that all was over shadowed by the amazing performance from a Oscar worthy Julianne Moore and the fantastic writing.

Julianne Moore takes this role has a mother who slowly losing her memory by Alzheimer's disease, and Moore knocked it out of the park as she makes a beautifully crafted performance that just boosted up her career as a actress.

The cast members like Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin and Kate Bosworth all did fantastic performance as well. Overall the performance were good in the film.

The writing was just spot on great and realistic as well, the directing was good and the film almost had me in tears at parts.

My only problems with the movie has to be the other character's, and I'm not talking about Moore's character I'm actually talking about the background character's that for some reason always get in the way of the story and don't really do anything. The movie to me isn't like the best movie of the year or of all time, the movie falls into the great, not into the brilliant.

Overall ""Still Alice"" has fantastic acting from Moore and from the other cast, great directing and writing. If you every got a chance to see it I say go ahead."

Permalink",False,"The real depredations of Alzheimer's disease and its toll on the families of the afflicted are not on display in the flawed drama.

""Iris,"" the 2001 film that starred Judi Dench as British novelist Iris Murdoch, was particularly frank about the effects of the illness, both mental and physical. It also highlighted the special tragedy when someone who has built a career as a communicator falls prey to the affliction.

""Still Alice"" should, by contrast, carry the label ""Sanitized for your protection."" Everyone involved is highly attractive, articulate, compassionate and virtually devoid of any flaws that would mark them as human.

What's left is a sensitive and appealing performance by Moore as Alice's mind fades from early onset Alzheimer's; her character has just turned 50. As for the rest of the story, adapted by directors and co-writers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland from Lisa Genova's 2007 novel, it has plot holes large enough to accommodate a Mack truck.

Quite sensibly, for instance, Alice's three children undergo genetic testing. Daughter Anna tests positive. That turn in the drama leads -- nowhere.

Another daughter, seems to be making bad choices both in her romantic life and as a budding stage actress. What happens next? We're not told.

Husband John bears every crisis with a preternatural calm, even when he's planning to pull up stakes from New York and move to a job at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic. Surely he must have strong emotions about his wife's illness. But, if so, they're never shown.

Having always been defined by her intellect and adept use of language, Alice is sometimes reduced to making speeches about her frustration. ""Sometimes I can see the words hanging in front of me and I can't reach them, and I don't know what I'm going to lose next.""

She learns to get by using her cellphone as a reminder of tasks, and the online game ""Words With Friends"" to shore up her vocabulary.

Alice has also made a video giving her future self instructions on how to take her own life. Her eventual attempt to do so goes awry. Yet any moral or even dramatic ramifications from this line of conduct are ignored in the movie's final -- and perhaps most glaring -- default.

Permalink",True,"A difficult film to dislike, ""Still Alice"" has its heart and head in the right place. Julianne Moore's performance, as always, is terrific. However, on the whole, it falls flat.

This story of a brilliant, vital women afflicted by a rare, congenital form of early onset Alzheimers fails in not fully exploring the emotion in the relationships between her and family, particularly hubby Alec Baldwin. Adding to the gap between audience and film is an excess of documentary education regarding this awful disease. All that and the redolence of Oscar bait.

Plainly, hubby acts a moron. His motivation in the midst of his wife's swift decline is a plum new job. He literally abandons her to move to Minnesota from New York. Throughout he is neutral by maintaining a cold, clinical outlook. He speaks nary a word regarding the intellectual and emotional loss of a wife he's spent decades beside. The filmmakers, either intentionally or not, portrayed his exit as a convenient way to move on. The tears he sheds before splitting smack of relief, not grief.

It's not only hubby foregoing real emotion. Moore's eldest, pregnant daughter reacts with an ""It's okay"" after discovering she has the gene and is doomed to a similar fate. While hysteria would push the story into unwanted melodrama, the non-reactive portrayal is similarly unwanted.

Moore's great concern with her youngest daughter is nagging about eschewing acting for the stability of a college education. It is this daughter who volunteers to caretake Mom. An odd final scene finds the daughter reading the play ""Angels In America"" to a far gone Moore. As if trying to wring something from her she is unable to give, the daughter asks, ""What is the play about?"" to which Moore haltingly replies, ""Love."" ""That's right. Love,"" the daughter replies. Saying 'Love' does not infuse a story with the emotion. Showing love does, and it's absent here. Those close to Moore simply look at her with a morbid curiosity reserved for strangers.

Moore's decline is heartbreaking, particularly when a pre-planned suicide fails. It's a shame she's surrounded by matter-of-fact robots.

Audiences should not be required to fill in blanks of emotion between Moore and others. There have been far more affecting Disease of the Week made for TV movies. Disconnecting to emphasize the least important aspects of dealing with a person afflicted by this awful disease is more tragic than this story.

Permalink",False,"I can hardly find the words to describe the total and utter let down that this film was to me. I have worked with dementia sufferers for the last 35+ years and can honestly say that the depiction of that cruel thief of minds and bodies was totally totally lacking. None of the daily struggles that the brave carers have to deal with on a multiple basis each day was even alluded to, let alone covered.

If you are going to make a film about something as devastating as dementia then at least do some decent research and don't insult the viewing public with a sanitized version which could only be believed by someone who has no experience of the issue.

On the plus side, the acting was good given the dreadful and inaccurate script. I was more than pleasantly surprised by Kristen Stewart I have to admit and how can you go wrong with Alec Baldwin? Oh, and Julianne too but the dreadful writing made it hard to be too excited about the representation of an imaginary character.

Next time let's have some real angst, agonising decision-making, changes of personality, hostility, belligerence etc. And also can we have a little of the treatments which help to hold on to the 'person' for as long as possible.

Disappointing. Very very disappointing. A totally wasted opportunity to show some of the facts."

Permalink",True,"Still Alice is a troubling film. Not because it's about Alzheimers, but because it isn't. Not really.

Still Alice is based on a novel of the same name about a 50 year woman who is struck with early onset Alzheimers. That happens of course. And it is tragic. But a novel is fiction. In this case, the author has created an extraordinarily successful academic whose speciality is linguistics . She begins to lose the 'words' that have defined her life, and so begins her inevitable decline. I have only read summaries of the novel, but as in the movie, author Lisa Genova has given her an equally successful academic husband, three talented grown children, a brownstone in New York, and another rustic ocean-side home at the Cape. It's a perfect life , as the character admits, but she is still a fictional character.

And the movie based on the novel is even more of a fiction. Alice and her husband Johnare Julianne Moore and Alec Baldwin,—-both fine actors —-but that's not the point. They are Hollywood stars who come with celluloid glamour by definition. Our identification with those impossibly beautiful people is not with any commonly known reality . And this doesn't even begin to describe their three perfect children. The only only one who might not fit the mould is Lydia, the slightly rebellious ('I don't want to go to college to study acting; I'm going to follow my dream in LA') youngest daughter—- played by Twilight's 'it' girl of the day Kristen Stewart. Of course, one can make this criticism about any film 'story', but the point here is that Alzheimer's by now is a known reality for most of us in some way or another, and casting beautiful, famous stars detaches us from the true horrors of losing those we love to this horrible disease.

Alice and her family 'have it all' in the novel and more than everything in the movie. The story that this movie tells about Alzheimer's is not even close to what, by now, most of us have experienced in some form. True, this film deals with early onset; but that is still a fairly rare form of this most devastating disease. The Alzheimer's that those of us who live in the real world experience is not a tragic attack on the relatively youthful and still beautiful . Let's be frank: the Alzheimer's that most of us know strikes old people —spouses, parents , relatives , friends . We may love them but once struck they are not often very attractive or vital. They can't take care of themselves, they swear and shout, they are often a danger to others and themselves and , frankly, they can drive us crazy. Plus we often have complex past relationships with them that can make care-taking anything from difficult to disastrous. Juliane Moore repeats things, gets a bit pale and wander-y and has one - quite manageable - outbreak of anger. That's Alzheimer's if the victim and their caretakers are very very lucky. And luck includes not only the course the disease may take but the resources —-emotional, social, and of course financial —-that are essential to let us be our best selves as we try to look after those with a disease that may go on for years.

Still Alice doesn't completely shy away from the difficulties. Alice's husband basically deserts her with the 'she wouldn't want us to be a burden' argument so he can move on to a big job of a at the Mayo clinic. But the wayward daughter comes home to look after mom; in the final scene she reads a piece of literary text to Juliane Moore(still looking pretty damn good). When she asks her mother what's its about, Alice finally manages to get out one word —-'love'.

So that's our lesson for the day. And it strikes home as we , as a society, struggle with questions of 'death with dignity' and assisted suicide. Alice, as her coherent intellectual self , planned a way out—- a video that would direct her Alzheimer's self to a lethal stash of pills she could access when she had come to a certain point—-so that she wouldn't lose herself, so that others would not have to lose the Alice that they knew and loved. In the novel and the film her perfect finale is complicated by the Alzheimer's Alice's inability to understand the directions of her former rational self. She is saved, literally, by the bell at the front door, but the message is clear. Suicide, in whatever form, is not the way out. There is always something worth living for.

And ideally , we would all hope so. We would all like to feel that suffering can have a point. That if we are struck by some calamity and are loved, suffering can be bearable—that suffering itself might have dignity. And the reverse, that the suffering of another can offer us an opportunity—the opportunity to love when it is not easy and there are few of the obvious rewards. Life should not be just pleasant but rich, and that richness can be found in pain as well as pleasure.

I want believe to that is true. But I am not persuaded by what Still Alice presents. I have a good life, I'm fortunate; but I have no faith that I'd be able to endure (whether I am the victim or the caretaker) the horrors of this disease. I don't want a fiction. Or at least I don't want a comforting one. Give it to me straight; if it's a story, I want one that is as tough as it can get. And that, by a a long stretch, isn't Still Alice

Permalink",True,"I think the movie could have still made the point if Mom had been a mere public school teacher without using and upper-income family: Mom the professor, Dad the scientist, daughter the lawyer, son the doctor. Sounds trite. The careers, IVF, genetic testing, high-end assisted living...this is not the average family.

Here is a what a caretaker child whose parent is lower income person, or one who exhausts her funds, will experience: Lack of sibling involvement even on the simple stuff; loss of health care because of loss of access (transportation), even on Medicaid, except by ambulance; no long- term care except limited in-home help; no-call, no-shows by home health agency (choice of two, get 4 hours/wk under Medicaid with one and only 2 hours/wk with the other, not a case of being able to fire anyone); assertive, knowledgeable relative can be investigated, perhaps indefinitely, for using tools, such as HIPAA restriction of health records (home health agency went over my head and received incorrect information on discharge date, canceling homemaker without notice). I spend many, many hours a week managing my mother and get no pay or even a thank-you from anyone. As the years have gone by, I thought my mother would get into assisted living, but no one will accept her with her because she has Medicaid because she is STILL not disabled enough (a phone cuing service tells her what do roughly six times day; cannot follow a movie but still seems to enjoy them; food consists of Meals on Wheels; easy prep like soups; fecal accidents; refusal to bathe; had to hire another tenant to deliver cat food to stop/reverse weight gain in her cat, cannot make a phone call, even on speed dial; without my daily visits she would be dead because she cannot recognize she is ill or make telephone calls.) Fortunately, she had as an Advance Directive, so unlike Alice, I know she would be okay with being highly disabled in a nursing home, but short of a heart attack or stroke, I do not see her getting there. Elderly public housing has become de facto marginal nursing homes. One nurse covers several projects. Not sure who makes her list for qualifying for a service, but not my mom. When Mom started blowing off her med cues, I called her doctor and his nurse contacted me stating there is no help, but if the missed meds are only so late, to give them to her. Then I doubled up on her med cues....

Permalink",False,"Still Alice is a film about a devastating situation which is unfortunately suffered by millions of people, and I appreciated the fact that this film avoided the excessive sentimentality or pre-fabricated drama. In other words, this isn't a lachrymose medical tale in which doctors struggle to find the cure, antidote or magical procedure to save the main character. Instead of that, Still Alice portrays the most trivial moments of daily life, which acquire a new dimension when they are experimented under the influence of Alzheimer. On the negative side, Still Alice doesn't feel very different to those ""dramas of the week"" which were used as filler in the TV prime-time during the '80s. What makes this film better than those ones is the extraordinary performances. Julianne Moore received deserved acclamation for her magnificent work, but the rest of the cast also brings perfect performances, highlighting Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart. In conclusion, Still Alice is a good film, but I didn't find it particularly memorable; it's a proper vehicle for brilliant performances, and period. Even though it may offer consolation to those who have had relatives or friends with this illness; my maternal grandmother suffered from it, and even like that, I didn't feel too much connection or identification with Still Alice; however, that didn't avoid me to appreciate its sober didactic intention and the quality of the performances."

Permalink",False,"""But this isn't fair."" Lydia Howland (Kristen Stewart)

Early-onset Alzheimer's is definitely not fair for anyone, especially 40-year old Dr. Alice Howland (Julianne Moore), noted linguist on the Columbia faculty. Still Alice tracks Alice from the first manifestations of the disease to the sad peak of forgetfulness. While the screenplay lacks any moving narrative thrust, her performance is worth seeing, so good she is bound to win the best-actress Oscar.

In almost a Lifetime-Channel template, the opening scene has the professor forgetting a word or two in a lecture. Subsequently she can't find the bathroom in the family cottage, while doting husband Dr. John Howland (a fine, non-sardonic Alec Baldwin) responds with love and understanding. No doubt she is in for a rocky rest of her life.

Besides the personal agony for her and her husband, a surprise awaits as the three children face the genetic legacy of the disease. They handle their mother's setback with assured courage, but their own genetic participation is problematic as they stand in for those in the a audience who have failed to see how close they can be to the ugly rule of the disease.

Most involved with her mother is the contentious child, Lydia, an actress not fulfilling her mother's expectations for a child pursuing traditionally rewarding and lucrative professions such as medicine and law. Though not taking a big stretch from the brooding Bella in Twilight, Stewart holds her own with Moore as a mature character torn between the tyrannical demands of her profession and a sense of responsibility for her deteriorating mother.

It's Moore's movie in the end, a role that quietly moves to the inevitable while never going overboard on the sentimentality of the dementia. Perhaps it's best to treat the disease with dark humor: ""I think I'm getting a little bit of Alzheimer's. Just a little."" Christopher Walken."

Permalink",False,"Okay, let me just say, Julianne Moore's performance is brilliant in the film; she captures the fear, sadness, helplessness and perseverance of an Alzheimer's patient with tact.

Other than Moore's acting, 'Still Alice' felt quite bland and underwhelming to me. It failed to give us more insight into the lead protagonist, and gave us almost no insight into the lives and minds of her loved ones. When someone is afflicted by Alzheimer's, it's his/her loved ones who suffer more. I mean, the person exists, but all the memories connecting him/her to others ultimately vanishes, and that is torturous to the people around. The film is too linear and paper-thin; the theme had so much potential, but it's completely squandered. All of the characters just merely exist that you almost feel nothing for any of the characters. Other than Alice's speech in the second half ,there wasn't a single moment or aspect which made me connect to the characters.

With much more needed depth, the movie could have been as terrifying as the disease itself, and may have given us some idea as to how people cope with it. Now, it's just one of those disease-movies which will be easily forgotten (except of course, for the fact that Moore finally won her Oscar for this)."

Permalink",True,"Firstly, Julianne Moore rightly deserved the Oscar for her performance. Sadly I feel a little cheated by the movie. Having experienced first hand a family member with the condition, I felt the portrayal of this characters symptoms quite easy to cope with. The movie finished before the serious deterioration set in. Anybody who has had experience of a family member or loved one, knows exactly how difficult a condition it becomes. I wish they had gone into more depth even if it meant another 45 minutes!!! The subject matter deserves the extra time. If people are going to see this movie in preparation of what may happen in their family, then they are being short-changed. Sadly, I came away feeling that this movie failed - it was a missed opportunity to tell the real heartbreak and sacrifices that family and friends go through. If only Alzheimer's/dementia were this easy! Saying that, it's not a bad movie - I'm not trying to put you off seeing it. Good cast who play their parts well.

Permalink",True,"I caught this film at a film festival and I'm so glad that I did. The Oscar buzz for Julianne Moore is more than warranted. I think and hope she'll win the Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Dr. Alice Howland.

Moore brilliantly and subtly charts the decline of her character's mental state. The rapid progression of her disease makes her an unreliable narrator and the directors use the camera's focus or lack there of to illustrate her episodes. There are so many touching moments and scenes in the film and it's all treated honestly and sensitively. Personally, Alzheimer's has struck my family and Still Alice captures the different reactions of it beautifully.

The supporting cast is truly supporting. There are no co-leads. Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart are the two standouts as John and Lydia. John's desire to ignore the reality and further his career, while deeply loving his wife hits home. Lydia's character is initially portrayed to be a rebellious aspiring actress and morphs into Alice's best caretaker. It's really quite touching and heartbreaking. Kate Bosworth is also strong as the Type A eldest daughter, Anna Howland-Jones. Lydia and Anna are very believable as sisters. Hunter Parrish's role as Tom is tiny, but he's good in it too.

Glatzer and Westmoreland did great work on this film.

Julianne looked so good at the beginning I assumed that she'd go downhill, but no, she looks just as good at the end! How Hollywood is that?

The supporting cast were pretty good, but my main complaint is that they've made the subject into a bit of a date movie - if you'd never heard of Alzheimers, it's the gentle intro you need. Even when she confuses her daughter with her sister (a big deal, I'd have thought) it's glossed over. No sexual advances to the wrong people, very few night terrors.

Overall, it's OK, but a very superficial view and dull script. Much better films out there that need your money."

But as a 'best of 2014' movie it IS NOT.

First a stereotypical Hollywood family, secondly a character (Alice) we really don't know very well until after her mental state starts to go awry, third a marriage we also don't know very well although Alec Baldwin does a decent job with the script he has. It's as if many parts are left unsaid and not communicated to the audience, and we're supposed to make up relationships and history as we go along.

Alice's strained (or not) relationships from her past just illustrated with grainy video and photos and schmaltzy music? Come on, my intelligence got insulted many times during this film, and I found myself wanting to walk out in the middle of it.

I could predict the ending, and of course the prediction came true. Was holding out hope that it would get better, that there was some redeeming fact or revelation that would redeem the first sections, but no such joy.

Permalink",True,"The story here is quite simple. A young (50) college professor, Alice Howland (played by Julianne Moore), is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. We follow her subsequent decline and its effects on her family.

Unfortunately for this movie, this story has been told before in Iris (2001) and told, it has to be said, with far greater honesty and impact. By comparison, Still Alice is more like an episode from a Hollywood soap opera than a serious attempt to portray the effects of this horrible disease (which my mother suffered from). The characters are thinly drawn, the script is at times banal and the story doesn't go anywhere.

One of the genuinely moving moments in the film is that Alice, foreseeing her forthcoming incapacity, records a set of instructions telling herself how to end it all with pills, this to be played when she can no longer remember certain key facts about her life. But when this time comes, Alice is incapable of carrying out her own instructions. The story is left with nowhere to go and ends later abruptly (and to the surprise of everyone in the theatre) with a message to the effect that 'it's all about love'. Noble sentiment but unsatisfactory cinema. It would have made a far more effective and poignant conclusion if Alice had managed to kill herself. That really would have given us something to think about. But that, perhaps, was seen as a step too far by the film-makers.

I must admit that I have never really rated Julianne Moore as an actor. To me she always looks as if she's acting. But following her Oscar award I thought twice. Sadly, my view has not changed. She did not bring enough of the bitterness, the anger, the desperation, the sheer cruel mindlessness of dementia. One can only assume that the Academicians were honouring the subject matter as much as the acting. Watch Judi Dench as Iris Murdoch, disintegrating, falling, fading with so much expressed not in words but by her face and eyes, a gut-wrenching performance that is simply in a different league. In fact the outstanding performance for me came from Kristen Stewart playing Alice's youngest daughter.

I was hoping for more from Still Alice. But I was disappointed.

Permalink",True,"Alice Howland, a successful and renowned Columbia University linguistics professor, is happily married with three grown children.

However, when she receives a devastating diagnosis from her doctor, she and her family struggle to cope with the reality of what their future holds.....

Alzheimer's disease is one of the most crushing illnesses anyone or any family can go through. The person it affects knows what is happening to them, and to see a member of your family mentally deteriorate day by day in front of you, will have a lasting effect on most people.

Its a really strong subject matter, one that could have been dealt with in a way that could offend a lot of people, but this film almost supports, almost councils people who are affected, or know someone affected by the disease.

Moore, as you'd expect is perfect as Alice, and to see her deteriorate is heartbreaking, touching, and very, very scary. She hasn't been this good in a very long time.

But wow, she is almost usurped by her support. If Alec Baldwin doesn't get nominated for an award next year, there is no justice. The scene where he finally breaks down after keeping it together for everyone, is so true to life, so brilliant, he so nearly steals the film.

Stewart too, proves that Twilight has long gone, and she puts in a wonderful performance also.

The ending is very somber though, because like the disease, it gives you no reprieve, no light at the end of the tunnel, but all in all, its a wonderful movie.

Permalink",False,"Last year, the Oscars had Philomena as one of the outsider movies at the Oscars. This year, clearly the outsider was Still Alice. A movie about a woman who is hit by Alzheimer a lot earlier than people normally do.

And I only watched it because I was curious about what Julian Moore had done to win the Oscar this year. And when the movie started, the disappointment kicked in. Why? because, I realized that once again they had given the Oscar to an actor who was playing the role of an ill person.

Don't misunderstand me, I think that Julian Moore does a good job, but I don't think her interpretation is worth an Oscar. Now that said, I have already seen Oscars given for a lot less (Penelope Cruz - I jest, Gwyneth Paltrow - I'm still in shock). Still, what is it about playing an ill/crippled person that always gets you the favor at the Oscars? Pacino needed 7 nominations and only won the Oscar when he played a blind guy. Daniel Day Lewis with my left foot, Matthew MConaughey and Tom Hanks - AIDS, Stephen Hawking this year, I don't get it!

Back to the movie, honestly, it's a little better than a TV movie. A very simple script and not much going on apart from seeing this lady deteriorating at a very fast pace. I doubt anyone will put this movie in their top 100 of all time. And the acting, Oscar or not, won't make it to a top 100 list either!"

What the film lacks in plot is made up for by Moore's enjoyable and convincing rendition of a 50 year-old mother who is struggling with the onset of said neurological disorder. Unfortunately this is where the praise must end. The script is often clunky and predictable and other than the titular role, no characterization is ever established. The stereotypical family members lack any depth and never show the proper emotions the straining situation on display surely would bring, following a long and annoying Hollywood tradition. This and the curious lack of a plot and despite the sadness of the story itself, makes for a very tedious viewing experience, especially towards the end.

It's ironic that a film dealing with Alzheimer's Disease should turn out so forgettable.

Permalink",False,"Having seen Iris - which ultimately dealt with the same issues - and Amour - which also had an elderly couple facing the demise of a spouse though this time a stroke was involved (both excellent films), I was disappointed with Still Alice since it was more concerned with providing a sentimental 'Hollywood' style view. Little was made of the probable anguish of immediate family members and far too much nice piano music and shots of scenic leaves, buds and photogenic puddles! I felt that the performance of all the actors was good and convincing. However, the plot, direction and style of the film seems very lacklustre and only sought to involve one's more sugary sentiments. I have seen several films and TV programmes involving Alzheimer's disease, all of which have managed to capture the horror of a life slowly dissolving. It is of course hard to empathise with the person suffering once they become alienated from the world and become unresponsive but the difficulties experienced by those close to them could have been treated much better. Many of the subplots were just a distraction from the main thrust of the film.

Permalink",True,"One thing we can count on in this movie is the superb acting by Julianne Moore. Her portrayal of a professor who sees her life crumble into nothingness as her mind deteriorates. It's one emotional experience to see her change from a self-assured Linguistic professor to a woman who becomes disconnected from the rest of the world because the chemical dynamics of her brain have changed. It's a heartbreaking turn.

Moore is introduced as a professional who encounters the worst crisis of her career. she is unable to make a decision and is terrified of the future consequences. Soon, her life will be altered forever because she will have to surrender her independence, her self, and her established connections to her professional and personal universe.

Her family is supportive but confused because there will be repercussions to Alice's changes. Biologically, the gene is present in her children, and it will affect their choices. Everyone is afraid because life will not be the same anymore. Alice is becoming more and more distant, and she is losing her connections and her trust. To see her become a scared being is painful. To realize that even the most basic activities are forever changed because she loses track of her surroundings because she is unable to develop memories anymore. She mixes the past and the future and doesn't recognize her actions or her relatives.

She has an incredible scene in the middle of the film when her last appreciation of how much her life will change is communicated through a speech that will have everyone gasping and tear-eyed. It's the last time she is able to communicate her thoughts, and to realize that she needs three days to put it together, that if there's not a highlighter around she might lose track of her ideas, and that dropping her paperwork could lead to disaster is a perfect display of acting and direction at their best.

""Alice"" is based on real people's experiences. There are hopes and dreams, tragic endings, and love as the most powerful of forces, and it's movies like ""Alice"" that allow us to remember the power of humanity and maybe will inspire many to look for ways to help people who suffer from these conditions or might be more susceptible to them because of genetics. Forget the convoluted search for that super clever film or another tribute to a historical figure. I want a real connection, with social relevance and immediate consequences that will appeal to us in a universal way.

Permalink",False,"Moore is great throughout, and Stewart is good, but only at the very, very end when she reads from Angels in America (she's embarrassingly bad doing Chekhov earlier). Otherwise this movie is terrible.

The incompetent directors made a potentially moving story trite and insulting. It's written and directed like a bad soap opera, with loud, heavy-handed music forcing us to feel sad when they want us to feel sad, tense when they want us to feel tense, etc. They didn't trust Moore to put it all across or us to get it without their larding on the schmaltz with a trowel (a shockingly un-kosher metaphor). They must have assumed Moore and all of us are as stupid as they are.

I would give it more stars if Moore alone had made this moronic movie worth watching, but no actor is that good. Todd Haynes's brilliant mid-1990s movie Safe is infinitely better than this awful movie is, with an even more powerful performance from Moore that he nurtures and enhances, instead of trashing her genius as these morons do.

Permalink",True,"Every single person in the audience was an elderly woman, when I went to see this movie. And I think all of us were scared to death because according to statistics your risk of getting Alzheimer really progresses after the age of 65.

And here comes Hollywood! The person affected by Alzheimer in the movie is not an elderly woman, but a beautiful woman Alice, played by Julianne Moore, who just turned 50. Only a tiny percentage gets Alzheimer so early! A woman ,who seems to accept that terrible disease without any drama and while supposedly her condition deteriorated rapidly, she is still able to give a speech on Alzheimer without even once glancing at her painfully prepared notes, which we see her earlier tracing word by word with a highlighter. But once on stage, miracle over miracle she never looses eye contact with the audience.

The kind of Alzheimer she got, we learn from her neurologist, is passed on from generation to generation and again without any drama her three children who are at high risk to have inherited the disease, accept the fact that they- in one case has the gene,- in the second case does not have the gene and- in the third case the daughter chooses not to find out. Wow, what a well balanced family.

The whole family seems somehow to be detached from the fact that the wife and mother has a life-threatening disease. Nobody creates a safety system to protect Alice from getting lost or help her create crutches to deal with the memory problem. Nobody really seems to care and they all just go on with their lives as if nothing had happened. Neither husband (Alec Baldwin) nor any of the children seem to spend any time with Alice after she had to give up her teaching job. Only at the very end when her mind is already completely gone, one daughter comes to take care of her.

And following the film nothing really dramatic happens

The only a little bit embarrassing situation shown is when Alice wets her pants because she cannot remember where the bathroom is.

And the only moment of upset is when she looses her iphone.

I had more drama in my life with losing keys or forgetting appointments or names.And everything I have seen so far meeting people with Alzheimer was not pretty.

Like some other reviewers I found the movie a too sanitized outlook on one of the most frightening diseases of our time. The prognosis for the next decades is mind-boggling as people get older and the probability of them (especially women)getting Alzheimer is as big a reality, as the one that most men will get prostate cancer the older they get.

Everybody who wishes to die of old age should think again. As long as they have not found a cure, to be old and do not remember who you are is not something to thrive for.

The title Still Alice should have a question mark. And the answer is no. At the end she is just a shell, nobody home. I can understand that she wanted to commit suicide, you want to pull the plug before you are a complete vegetable.

Watching the final credits I saw that one of the producers was Maria Shriver, whose father suffered from Alzheimer too.I wonder if her experience with her father was so sanitized. Well, it certainly helps if you are rich and can hire people, who take care of the patient and the problems related with Alzheimer. But for those, who cannot afford it, the outlook is dire.

The film left me unsatisfied. Contrary to the movie ""Iris"" with Judi Dench and Kate Winslet where we get a clear picture of the patient before and after she was diagnosed, Still Alice lacked depth and during the whole film I could not forget that I was watching Julianne Moore and Alec Baldwin and some other actors. I was watching Hollywood, not a disaster called Alzheimer.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice (2014) is about a linguistics professor at Columbia University, played by the incomparable Julianne Moore. She has a very happy, fulfilling life, with husband Tom (Alec Baldwin) and children Anna (Kate Bosworth), Tom (Hunter Parrish) and Lydia (Kristen Stewart). In the beginning of the film we witness her having memory issues. She grows concerned and goes to a neurologist who diagnoses her tragically with early onset Alzheimer's disease. It isn't long before Alice begins to lose the extensive vocabulary she spent a lifetime to research. The family suffers with her as she completely loses all resemblance of the woman she once was. Let me start out here by saying that Alzheimer's is tragic. I wouldn't worship it on my bitterest of nemeses. Cancer and AIDS for that matter too, these are painful horrible diseases that need to be eradicated from the earth. With that being said, I did not really feel what this movie was trying to make me feel. Julianne more is a brilliant actress. I have loved her in so many films; as Maude Lebowski in the Big Lebowski (1998), Amber Waves in Boogie Nights (1997) or Linda Partridge in Magnolia (1999). If she wins this year, I will say it's a push from all of her great un-awarded past works. Still Alice is just the great Julianne Moore doing what she does best. I don't find the character or the story very memorable. I can predict if she wins, whatever actress who is nominated next year hopes she is staring alongside Alec Baldwin. He was Kate Blanchet's co-star in Blue Jasmine (2013), last year's best actress. He must be a good luck charm. Kristen Stewart as Lydia is no departure from every role she has ever done; brooding with angst and unhappiness. Just once I want Stewart to do a raunchy sex comedy, a slapstick buddy comedy or any role that will get her out of her acting like she is constipated. She has been typecast as an unhappy teenager for life it seems. Overall with the cast being good, and the story being relatable to so many people, I wondered why the film failed to hook me. The directors Richard Glazter and Wash Westmorland seemed to fall from the mark here, neither this film nor the directors were nominated. So I looked up on IMDb to see if the two had done any other films I may have enjoyed. Maybe they just missed the mark with this one. Well, I was hard pressed to find a single film I'd seen of theirs. Reason being, their claim to fame is for directing gay porn. Not making that up. The soundtrack I was a miss on because it featured Lyle Lovett. I personally am not a fan of him. I think Still Alice may be a very impactful film for a person whose life has been touched by the horrible affliction of Alzheimer's. Other than that, I would pass on this movie in any format, Netflix or Cable.

Permalink",True,"Still Alice (2014): Dir: Richard Glatzer, Wash Westmoreland / Cast: Julianne Moore, Alec Baldwin, Kristin Stewart, Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish: Depressing yet informative drama about the one's identity, whether it be how one views themselves or how others view us. The subject is Alzheimer's disease and Julianne Moore plays a professor who discovers that she is gradually forgetting things. When out jogging she losses sight of where she is. When given seminars she struggles with key words. Her husband is played by Alec Baldwin who maintains support yet deals with it much through work. Hunter Parrish, Kate Bosworth and Kristin Stewart play their grown children who also must get tested when it is learned that Moore's father had the disease prior and likely passed it down. Parrish is seen very little in the film that it is almost unnecessary to have the character at all. Bosworth plays married daughter expecting twins. She learns that the disease has been passed down to her but her twins are fine. Stewart makes a fine dramatic turn as the other daughter whose acting career in theatre is halted at the news of her mother's condition. Directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland with a provocative setup that travels predictable grounds before arriving at a touching scene between mother and daughter. Biggest drawback is its dreary TV movie quality that nearly sabotages the film. Thankfully Moore's gut wrenching performance drive the message home of Alzheimer's and the need to maintain one's identity until the only ones who can maintain it are the ones who care most. Score: 6 ½ / 10

Permalink",False,"Best part of watching a Oscar nominated film is that some unique constraint is always attached to it - be it direction , screenplay , story or acting. Now acting is what make Still Alice immensely watchable and Julianne Moore gives the performance of her life time.

Still Alice tells story of an English professor whose life changes after she is diagnosed with Alzeimer's disease. The film reflects the chronicles of life of protagonist post-disease and characters surrounding her life.

The story is pretty simple and straight and yet convincing which is adapted on a novel based on same name written by Lisa Genova. The director-duo Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland succeeds in keeping you engaged for next 101 mins and extract impeccable performances by the star cast for which they should be given full-marks. Show-stopper is certainly Julainne Moore with her award-winning performance. She breathes through the character of Alice as if it was tailor-made for her. You will feel sympathy for her yet encouraged with her dialogues ""Live in the moment"". Rest of the starcast equally contributes to the film's story. Art direction is good. Cinematography is nice. Background score is tuneful. On the flipside, it could have been best film if little more focus could have been given to the emotional quotient.

Julianne Moore is electrifying which is enough to make you watch the film. Good 3.5 /5"

Permalink",False,"Based on the novel by Lisa Genova, Richard Glatzner and Wash Westmoreland's Still Alice is the story of Alice Howland (Julianne Moore), a fifty-year-old Professor of Linguistics at Columbia University who has been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. A strong and brilliant woman, whose identity has been strengthened by the roles she has played in life, is forced to create a new one based on the only reality she knows - the present moment. While Moore's understated yet powerful performance which has earned her a much-deserved Oscar nomination, convincingly conveys the tragedy of someone losing their identity, she never lets us forget who she really is behind her growing incapacitation.

After suffering seemingly random memory losses such as forgetting a word or two during her lectures, Alice is shaken when she becomes disoriented on a jog through campus, a terrain that she knows very well. When she fails to recognize her son Tom's (Hunter Parrish), girlfriend at a dinner party, she seeks an opinion from neurologist Dr. Benjamin (Stephen Kunken). Ruling out a brain tumor, he performs tests that confirm the diagnosis of a rare early-onset dementia for which the medical profession has no answer. The hardest blow is finding out that there is a genetic component to her illness and the disease may be passed on to one or more of her children.

Unable to continue as a University professor, Alice must confront the reality of her memory slipping away. She begins forgetting names, is unable to find items that have been misplaced, and cannot perform ordinary tasks without assistance. Glatzner (who himself has been diagnosed with ALS) and Westmoreland do not manipulate us into feeling pity for Alice as a victim but allow us to feel what Alice is feeling and see the world through her eyes. The stresses and strains on her family are telling. Alice asks husband John (Alec Baldwin), a biologist, to take a year off from work while she can still function but he has been offered an important job with the prestigious Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and must make a difficult choice.

The film tracks Alice's steady decline as she struggles to maintain perspective. With the encouragement of her doctor, she speaks to the Annual Dementia Care Conference telling them, ""I am not what I say or what I do or what I remember. I am fundamentally more than that . . . I am not suffering. I am struggling."" She is aware of society's attitude towards the disease and at one point, notes that she would rather have cancer - at least then people would be more understanding. In one of the most intense scenes in the film, Alice tries to follow suicide instructions she left for herself on her laptop at an earlier time, but even that becomes too much for her.

Though there are no distracting sub-plots, the supporting characters feel oddly one-dimensional. While John moves from outright denial to support, it always feels reluctant and there is no sense of emotional commitment. Neither Anna (Kate Bosworth), an expectant mother nor Tom comes alive as real human beings going through their own personal struggle. The opposite is true, however, for Lydia (Kristen Stewart), Alice's youngest daughter. Lydia's personal growth from being a self-centered, rebellious young woman who cannot think beyond her own immediate needs to a mature individual, willing to give of herself in an act of love is one of the emotional centers of the film. Though Still Alice is sad, it is not depressing and the integrity of the directors together with Moore's superb performance lift the film from being another melodrama to that of a genuine and heartfelt experience."

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

Linguistics professor Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) slowly begins forgetting things and after a scary situation where she finds herself lost, she decides to have an exam and she learns she has Alzheimer's disease. After breaking the news to her husband (Alec Baldwin) she must confront her three children with the hard reality that she's not going to be herself for much longer.

STILL ALICE goes from heartbreaking at the ten-minute mark and just gradually grows more depressing as it moves along. The film is a very intimate look at a brilliant woman who has always used her mind but slowly finds every bit of it and her memory floating away as she finds herself turning into someone that she doesn't even know. There's no doubt that the appeal of such a story is going to be very small. Heck, I can't really say I blame people for not wanting to watch such a depressing and sad movie but at the same time those who do decide to watch it are in for a treat because it's certainly a gem and features one of the year's strongest performances.

Of course, that strong performance belongs to Moore who once again shows why she's one of the strongest actresses out there. I will admit that when she first started to become known back in the early 90's, I was usually hit and miss on her performances. With that said, over the past decade she has really challenged herself and done some very demanding roles and for the most part she's been able to conquer all of them. That's certainly true here as she so brilliantly plays this character no matter what stage of the disease she's battling. Whether it's early on when she's giving speeches or towards the end when she can't remember anything, Moore simply becomes this character and there's not a single frame where you feel as if you're not watching a real person struggling with the disease.

The supporting cast is also quite memorable with Baldwin really standing out in the role of the husband. I thought he did an extremely good job with the role and he too had some tender moments as he struggles watching his wife go away. Kristen Stewart also turns in a good performance as the youngest daughter who often found herself battling her mother. Kate Bosworth is also good in her bit part. Technically speaking the film is also impressive thanks to the great cinematography, which also becomes its own character. I enjoyed how the camera would make people out of focus to show Alice forgetting them and then bringing them back into focus as her memory started to come back. The tender music score also perfectly captures the mood of the picture.

Directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland handle the material with a very sensitive touch and rarely do they throw in any comedy. There's no question that the work of Ingmar Bergman had a strong influence on the film and had this been in B&W it would have been all the more obvious. STILL ALICE isn't an easy to film to watch but it's quite rewarding in the end."

Permalink",True,"This movie is incredible! It's script is not overly complicated and the story is simply told. Julianne as Alice really blew me away. Particularly the scene between her and Alec Baldwin, her on screen hubby John. Alice is saying she thinks something is really wrong, and he is not really hearing or taking her too seriously. She then starts to sob, and it's is so sincere I found myself having a cry in the theatre myself. There are a couple of moments like these as the nasty disease Alzheimer's really reveals itself. It's a lovely acted movie by all, but for me, Julianne Moore is simply outstanding and I really hope there's an Oscar in it for her. There are several scenes where the ugliness of Alzheimer's shows itself and you realise the incredible impact this would have on a family. Go see this movie for two reasons, Julianne Moore and to learn a bit more about this insidious disease!

Permalink",False,"Julianne Moore's performance is the prime reason for watching this movie. As a film about Alzheimer's Disease, it is a lot less interesting and involving than Sarah Polley's AWAY FROM HER (2006), which featured Julie Christie depicting the onslaught of the condition, and like Ms Moore gaining an Oscar nomination for her work.

STILL ALICE, though well-meaning, is a lot more ponderous than Polley's movie. All the characters, including Moore's, are written so schematically that it's difficult to feel they really exist. Moore, superb actress that she is, rises above the writing. Of the supporting cast, only Stephen Kunken, as Alice's doctor, is able to match her. Alec Baldwin does his very best, but he doesn't manage to overcome the functionality of his brilliant-but-sensitive husband character. The others similarly flail around, but at least they try. What Kirsten Stewart is doing is impossible to understand. Her character is meant to be a struggling young actress. We finally see her on stage in a usually infallibly moving speech from Chekhov, which she recites as flatly as she does everything else in the movie. Impossible to take seriously, rendering a key relationship in the story lifeless.

The photography has some interesting moments depicting Alice's disorientation, but this is offset by some deadly montages of leaves on trees to represent time passing. The music is sentimental. The feeling is of the directors not having enough faith in their material.

None of this, not even Ms Stewart, submerges the amazing Ms Moore, who is never anything less than compelling."

Permalink",True,"Julianne Moore's Oscar is well overdue, it seems to be a pretty common opinion, and Still Alice seems to be the film that pushes the possibility of her finally receiving a prestigious Academy award (Boogie Nights, Far from Heaven, The Hours; all were worthy). Moore embodies Alice in the same perfect manner that she embodies the volumes and traits of her previous characters. But the film seems forced. It seems that the film's purpose is purely to get Moore the Oscar. She deserves it, no doubt. But aside from her triumphant performance, the film is flat and uneven, and even at 100 minutes, it feels just a touch to long.

Your opinion on this film may vary, depending on if you have a relationship with someone who has Alzheimer's. I've been told that it is one of the most accurate portrayals of the emotional, painful process. I could believe that. Moore shows Alice's descent every step of the way, and be warned, it can get uncomfortable.

Adapted from Leso Genova's novel of the same name, the screenplay doesn't seem to be able to carry the wait of the film. It rests on Moore's shoulders. Alice Howland is a linguistics professor at Columbia University, a job in which memory and the study/knowledge of words is clearly vital. Alice slowly starts to forget words, she gets lost whilst jogging on campus, eventually she is unable to remember where the bathroom is. The story is her journey. We are with her every step of the way from her healthy state, right down to the breaking point. The final scene left me unsatisfied. For everything we have experienced with Alice, we are left with an inevitable ending, yes, but not a desired ending. I guess you'll get what you expect. An emotional outcome for Still Alice.

Kristen Stewart is not remarkable here. Her real stellar turn is in 'The Clouds of Sils Maria' alongside Juliette Binoche. Alec Baldwin plays Alice's husband, a performance that doesn't exactly surprise or jump out at you, but it's hard to imagine anyone else in his shoes. Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish play Alice's children along with the previously mentioned, Kristen Stewart.

I feel bad giving this film a seemingly low score, but it's not inviting enough, it's not accessible. I guess I wished the directors had a greater vision, a wider and broader scope. It's not the film that I wanted. I got the performance, but not the movie. Watch this for Moore. She shines.

However, the actual person with Alzheimer's would not behave at all like depicted and so it was very poorly written and scripted in that regard. Very unrealistic portrayal of the disease and how it impacts family members. In the early to middle stages of the illness, Alice is far more functional, as a professor of linguistics, even able to compose and deliver a complex speech, after she lost her job, and this would never be possible. It is unfortunate that this film received awards because it conveys a very false picture of the impact of the illness.

Permalink",False,"Here it is, Julianne Moore's best shot at an Oscar. She hasn't been this close for 12 years, which marks about half of her career. It's a shame that she's good but not great in Still Alice. That more or less sums up the film which too often just does more than the bare minimum. It's a straightforward descent into the bleak grip of Alzheimer's, one with no destination in mind, nor frills to offer. That said, in its best moments it gives an interesting perspective. The tragic idea that a lifetimes work is being lost and how it's something that has been passed down unwittingly for generations and will be passed down for future generations. Those little moments are what bolsters the otherwise bland Still Alice. Unfortunately the film stumbles in Moore's hands. When the film has its incidents her conviction isn't good enough to make them work dramatically and they come off as awkward jolts. It's a problem with the editing and direction, but she could have overcome them. However, she has her moments when it's more nuanced, and it's nice to see a little 30 Rock reunion with Alec Baldwin. It's no Away From Her but the Academy will eat it right up.

Permalink",False,"'STILL ALICE': Four Stars (Out of Five)

Critically acclaimed drama film about a famous linguistic professor, that just turned 50, who is diagnosed with early Alzheimer's disease. It's based on the best selling 2007 book, of the same name, by Lisa Genova and stars Julianne Moore; who's considered an Oscar front-runner for Best Actress (at the upcoming Academy Awards). It costars Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish and was written and directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland. I found the movie to be absolutely heartbreaking but well made and effective.

The story begins with Alice Howland (Moore), and most of her family, having dinner at a nice restaurant; while celebrating Alice's 50th birthday. We soon learn that Alice is a cognitive psychologist and is married to the equally career driven John Howland (Baldwin). They have three grown children together: Lydia (Stewart), Anna (Bosworth) and Tom (Parrish). Anna is married, starting a family of her own, and Lydia is a struggling actress, living in another state, who constantly argues with her mother about her goals in life (and the way in which she pursues them). When Alice suddenly finds out she has early Alzheimer's disease, it greatly effects the whole family.

It's undoubtedly a well made and heart-wrenching film; with impressively calculated directing and strong performances from all of it's cast (especially Moore, who drives the entire film). I cried multiple times, while watching it, and again after I finished viewing it (while thinking back on it). It's a very powerful film but extremely depressing. It's not a movie I can say I enjoyed watching, at all, and I definitely don't look forward to seeing it again, anytime soon. I'm often not sure how high I should rate films like this, because they're not inspiring or entertaining in any way, but they do serve an important purpose. The movie definitely does what it sets out to do, in a very effective way, and deserves a lot of credit for it.

Permalink",False,"""Still Alice"" is one of the movies that reminds us how unpredicted life is. The devastating realization of how dramatically a person's life can change. The appalling feeling of knowing there is nothing you can do to make it go away. Lisa Genova's homonym book, tells the story of not only Alice Howland (J. Moore), but also every person's that is experiencing the Alzheimer's disease. The movie perfectly describes the changes Alice's condition makes in her, and her family's lives. Moore's heartbreaking performance gives a view of her ""whole new life"" that immediately makes the audience feel compassion, sympathy but also comprehension of this horrible disease. The impressive supporting performances of K. Stewart and A. Baldwin, contribute for this film to be effortlessly excellent.

Permalink",False,"Directors and co-writers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, working from Lisa Genova's novel, do not have an attuned ear for everyday familial conversation. ""Still Alice"", about a (rather wealthy) 50-year-old linguistics professor named Alice who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, opens with a dinner sequence (at a posh restaurant with a gorgeous view) wherein none of the actors around the table resembles each other or who speaks in the same rhythm. It's important to note that the professor and her husband (who is usually on the couch 'working' on his laptop) have money and eat well; this affords Glatzer and Westmoreland the opportunity to push ahead with their melodramatic agenda and not have the characters be concerned about finance. Julianne Moore won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Alice; she's good, but then Moore has always been a fine, reliable actress. She doesn't do anything different here than in her previous films. Alec Baldwin, on the other hand, portraying Alice's rock-solid spouse, has used up all of his dramatic resources as an actor. He has played so many shady characters that he inadvertently invests this non-character with a suspicious undercurrent (he's always pursuing his lips in thought, or tossing back his head in fake merriment). Kristen Stewart is given the most screen-time of the couple's three grown children, and she's also the only one of the three who looks involved in the proceedings (it's a commendable, though forgettable performance). As to the narrative, we are offered some interesting facts about Alice's disease, the most devastating of which is that the gene is almost always passed down from the parent to the child. Alice's trips to the neurologist are far more gripping than her daily life speaking, walking, running, puttering about her homey digs in New York City or gazing at the ocean from her summer home in Nassau County. I don't know what world these filmmakers are from, but I would suspect it comes rent-free. ** from ****"

Permalink",False,"Still Alice is about a fifty year old woman who finds out that she has early-onset Alzheimer's disease and her experiences dealing with it. To begin, the acting was fantastic. Julianne Moore excelled at performing the subtle nuances in the degeneration of both her mind and body in small and incremental steps. It was one of those performances that made me forget I was watching an actor at times. For those of you who are nervous about Kristen Stewart's performance, she was fine; not great, but acceptable. Like every movie she is in she just acts emotionally distant but it works for the character she plays here. Each member of Alice's family was introduced tremendously well in a dinner scene were the personalities of all of them were expressed almost immediately without feeling forced or awkward. The story is very well told, with best part of the storytelling being in the cinematography. This movie says a lot without actually speaking. When Alice is walking around and begins to forget where she is, the background will begin to lose focus and blur, losing the audience as well. There are several techniques similar to that that really brings the audience into Alice's shoes. The plot is very similar to The Theory of Everything. The protagonist gets a disease and has to drastically change their life in order to compensate as their relationships and way of life deteriorates. Before I put more emphasis on my opinions of the plot, I want to put some stress what kind of a movie this is. This movie is an experience, and not really a story. It excels at everything in terms of sharing the experience of developing this disease with the audience, but the story elements just sort of sit on top of that. If you saw Gravity, you might know what I am talking about. The movie focuses on the experience that the main character is going through instead of the story involving the character. Do not think that this is a negative; it is just a different type of movie. There are several small arcs that appear as the film progresses, but most are not really stressed enough or carry enough weight for me to be invested by the end. There is also a weird shift in focus about half way through the film which made it feel like two different movies. The first half is all about Alice's mental decline and her struggle with that. The second half focuses on the family and their struggle. While both halves are well told the shift in focus made then ending feel anticlimactic and unsatisfying. In order to remain spoiler-free, all I will say about the ending is that it didn't get to me as much as I think it wanted to. It tried to make me feel good about something that was not developed enough for me to care. In the end, I definitely recommend seeing this movie."

Permalink",False,"Championed by a truly memorable performance from one of the most beautiful, admirable & incredibly talented actresses of our time, Still Alice is a poignant, melancholic & heartbreaking tale that's neatly crafted & sensibly narrated but what truly makes it an emotionally resonant & visually engaging cinema is the fabulous lead show by the lovely Julianne Moore.

Based on Lisa Genova's novel of the same name, Still Alice tells the story of Alice Howland; a happily married linguistic professor with three children, who finds out that she is suffering from an early onset Alzheimer's disease. The plot covers the struggle she & her family undergoes during the progression of the disease as she slowly begins forgetting words, locations & even her loved ones.

Written & directed by Richard Glatzer & Wash Westmoreland, the film keeps it entire focus on Alice from start to finish & even though it sometimes carry the usual sentimental approach these stories usually rely on, the good thing here is that Still Alice isn't entirely dependent on it. The technical aspects are finely carried out & although there isn't anything special about them, there isn't anything to complain either.

Coming to the performances, Still Alice features a commendable cast in Julianne Moore, Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth & Hunter Parrish, and although the supporting work is reliable, Moore's performance here is so remarkable that she overshadows everything else that exists in the film. Baldwin brilliantly chips in as her husband while Stewart, Bosworth & Parrish stand in as her children & do a fine job in their given roles.

On an overall scale, Still Alice tackles a sensitive subject with sensible compassion & presents Julianne Moore in sublime form. It's an amazing performance from her as she truly owns her character in every scene & makes the viewers feel the pain of every lost memory. I did expect it to conclude with a different ending & was actually hoping n looking forward to it but was still satisfied to a certain extent with the moment it chose to wrap up its tale. Definitely worth a shot."

Permalink",False,"I had this film for a long time before I watched it. When I heard about it I wanted to go see it. But knowing the subject matter I wasn't crazy about the certainty of crying non stop in the cinema.

I don't personally know anybody that had or has Alzheimer's. So I can only view this film through my imagined idea of what it would be like to be part of a family that this terrible condition touches.

From my narrow viewpoint I think that the cast and crew did a fantastic job in demonstrating in a more passive way how it affects the family. Their part of the story is important but the film doesn't go out of its way to over dramatise every possible conflict that will arise from living with someone that has Alzheimer's.

I also felt and rightly so, that the more important point was to focus on Alice herself. Julianne Moore in my mind does a fantastic job in taking the viewer along with her.

I passed over this film numerous times knowing how it would make me feel. Ever since I saw Iris I knew from past experience that this would be a difficult film to watch. While Iris brought a more turbulent narrative to the screen and reflected how monstrous and destructive Alzheimer's is. Still Alice offered an additional focus. How it can hit a younger person and how devastatingly quickly it can dismantle a mind.

I have watched it now and can now recommend it to others. But I doubt I will ever watch it again.

Not because it isn't an impressive piece of story telling! But because in the words of Chandler Bing. ""It's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!""

It is important for these stories to be told."

Permalink",False,"Diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease, a middle aged university professor tries to deal with the increasing confusion and uncertainty that comes with the condition in this emotionally charged drama. Best known for the fact that it won Julianne Moore what many considered to be an overdue Oscar, she is very good here and quite likely richly deserved to win. Moore captures the gradual stages of neurological decline with remarkable finesse and the writing/directing team of Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland afford her several moments to shine. An especially effective sequence has her enter her home and go from room to room in search of the bathroom, only to find herself in a near labyrinthine maze, opening and reopening doors that she has already tested. The first doctor's appointment that we see might be Moore's best scene though as the camera lingers on her face for minutes on end with a disembodied doctor's voice that is seen but never heard. Where the film disappoints though is in the depiction of the impact on Moore's family. She has three adult children, but we only ever get to know one in any real depth and while Alec Baldwin has several strong moments as her concerned husband, there are some odd moments in which we are unsure whether he cares more about his job, yet this angle then just fades away towards the end. It is a minor issue though in what is overall a touching, scary and thought-provoking film. Just what would it be like to lose your sense of personal identity altogether? Food for thought for sure."

Perhaps he should simply continue to try and imitate Donald Trump because he cannot act well enough to keep pace with Donald Duck much less accomplished actors and actresses.

Permalink",False,"An ordeal...but for what reward?

Alice Howland is happily married with three adult children and is a pre-eminent academic at a New York University. After some memory lapses she sees a doctor who, after tests, discovers that she has early onset Alzheimer's disease. We then see her deterioration and how she and her family cope with the disease.

A fairly harrowing experience - confronting, emotional, terrifying and depressing. However, while it is a sensitive, well-made movie, you wonder what is the point? Why watch it?

You know how it is going to go. It is pretty inevitable - there is not going to be a happy ending. (More or less - there is a chance of a alternate ending, but it is too simple and some would not regard it as ""happy"").

It is not that profound either.

So the idea is really to share in her ordeal. This makes for emotional watching, but is simultaneously very depressing, and terrifying. As a middle-aged person, I don't want to be reminded what might might lie in my future (and potentially sooner than I imagine)...

The one positive is the performance of Julianne Moore as Alice. She puts in a great effort in a complex, sensitive, foreign role. It is the kind of role they give Oscars too, and, no surprise, she got the Best Actress Oscar in 2015.

Good supporting cast which includes Alec Baldwin and Kate Bosworth. The surprise casting is Kristen Stewart as one of Alice's daughters. One would think that a complex, emotional, character-driven drama like this would be well out of her league...and one would be right in thinking that. However, she manages to be okayish and, for once, not ruin the movie. In an historic event, she even, on one occasion, manages a non-blank expression...

Overall: okay, but only just. Watch it if you like emotional journeys. Avoid it if don't want to be reminded about how much suffering there is in the world and what might lie in store for your own life."

Permalink",True,"To my great pleasure Still Alice wasn't all just about that horrible disease, Alzheimer's. Chances are it would've been a bit too tragic. Removed from what most people can truly relate to.

Rather, halfway through the movie I started hoping the story had something else at its heart, and well, I wasn't disappointed.

You know--in family life, as parents, children, brothers, and sisters, we take for granted we should all love each other, and care for each other, unconditionally. But the truth is, we have a special bond with some of them, and not with others. We try to play nice, but when things take a bad turn in life, we show ourselves for who we really are. Whether we like it or not.

Back to Still Alice--Lydia, the outcast daughter. Her choices and ambitions are looked down upon by everyone else. Yet the very first thing we see happening in this film, is Alice responding very affectedly to a token present from her ""well adjusted"" daughter, Anna. Make no mistake, this is an intentional opening. Alice's birthday at which Lydia is ironically missing.

Later, while Alice's state deteriorates rapidly, all Anna is occupied with is her own pregnancy. She's just glad her twin babies won't inherit the Alzheimer's gene. And that sums it up. This character was made unsympathetic on purpose.

Alice's husband, John, at least feels sorry, eventually. Admits to it. Not just by preferring his career over being with his wife, but it's in these little things. By being absent at Alice's speech at an Alzheimer's conference. By patronizing her when after a month, she finds her precious phone back, while what he really should've been doing is helping her find it the day it got lost. But he admits to all of it, yes. Towards Lydia alone, mind you. Crying in her arms.

Not to my surprise, Lydia is shown using her failing artistic career to move back to the east and care for her now helpless mother. One should note that while being on the other side of the country, she videocalls her mom regularly when the rest of the family isn't all that -genuinely- concerned.

Even during the final minutes, when Alice is barely able to speak anymore, and more poignantly, every other character isn't even in the film anymore, there's no hint of contempt, annoyance, neglect, selfishness, or ridicule in any of Lydia's actions or words. Just unconditional love for her mother, which the last scene confirms. As literally as it gets.

So at the risk of sounding self-important, yet without assuming I'm the only one who got this out of the film, I would recommend watching Still Alice in this context and see if you can relate to it. It's nothing to be ashamed of. You can't like everyone. Not even your own family. But as long as there's one of them that loves you for who you are, then you're good to go.

And I think that's a stunningly honest message.

Permalink",True,"Still Alice tells the story of Alice, a linguistics professor at Columbia who notices that she appears to be losing her memory. This culminates in a moment of panic for her during a run when she seemingly forgets where she is, despite being in a place she regularly frequents. At that point, she visits a neurologist and it is revealed she has early onset Alzheimer's. The rest of the movie shows us her steady loss of self as her memory continues fading at a rapid clip.

This movie lives and dies with Julianne Moore. She is sensational in the role of Alice, and shows us all the little losses Alice suffers as she eventually fades to nothing. Her performance is such that she manages to carry the entire movie. The problem with this film lies with everything else. Alice's husband, played by Alec Baldwin, is essentially an empty vessel. He shows that he cares about Alice, but we are given little insight into him or what he is thinking. Kristen Stewart is slightly more developed as Alice's youngest daughter, with whom Alice has a difficult relationship, but eventually rallies to her mother's side. The other actors are given nothing to do. For example, in one scene we learn that Alice's oldest daughter has the same gene Alice does and will likely develop Alzheimer's at an early age like her mother. This plot point leads nowhere. It's mentioned once and never discussed again. Alice also has a son, but again, he is given nothing to do. He could have been cut from the film, and literally nothing would be different. It's all very disappointing.

Overall, I would say, see this movie for Julianne Moore, and just grit your teeth through the rest.

Permalink",True,"With a combination of power and grace, Julianne Moore elevates ""Still Alice"" above its made- for-cable-television trappings, and delivers one of the more memorable performances of her career. This is no small feat, given the depth and breadth of Moore's filmography and her consistent ability to produce great work, from playing a porn star in ""Boogie Nights"" to an eccentric artist in ""The Big Lebowski"" to a frustrated housewife in ""Far From Heaven"" to her dead-on portrayal of Sarah Palin in HBO's ""Game Change."" She's such a smart, clever and instinctive actress that she never hits a false note. She finds unexpected avenues into her character, a challenging role that requires her to show a mental deterioration that's both gradual and inherently internal. Thankfully, ""Still Alice"" doesn't deify the woman she plays: Dr. Alice Howland, an esteemed linguistics professor at Columbia University who finds she's suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Co-directors and writers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland don't shy away from the steady and terrifying way the disease can take hold of a person and strip away her ability to communicate and connect with the outside world. But they also don't tell this story with much nuance or artistry in adapting Lisa Genova's novel. This is especially true when comparing ""Still Alice"" to a couple of recent films that have tackled the same territory: Sarah Polley's haunting ""Away From Her"" and Michael Haneke's unflinching ""Amour."" The flat lighting, the frequent use of maudlin music, a heavy reliance on medium shots and some awkward cutaways for reactions all contribute to the sensation of watching a rather workmanlike production better suited to the small screen. But the film's heart is in the right place, and the message matters, and it surely will resonate with the millions of people whose loved ones have suffered from this cruel disease. At the film's start, though, Alice has everything. It's her 50th birthday, and she's celebrating at a chic New York restaurant with her adoring family. Her husband (Alec Baldwin), who's also an academic, toasts her as the most beautiful, intelligent person he's ever known. She's stylish, accomplished, happy and financially secure. She radiates confidence and competence at all times. But soon, words–which have fascinated her throughout her life and provided the basis for her career–begin to elude her. She becomes disoriented on her daily jog around campus. She starts losing items around the house and forgetting scheduled events. A visit to a neurologist reveals that Alice has a rare form of Alzheimer's, and that it's genetic. Fascinatingly, because she is such an intellectual, she's been able to play tricks on her brain and find shortcuts to mask her illness. But in no time, the bottom drops out from underneath her, and it's heartbreaking to watch. Moore plays it small for the most part, conveying fear with her eyes or slight shifts in the tone of her voice, so the moments when her character understandably snaps in panic really stand out in contrast. The fact that a woman who's an expert in linguistics has trouble articulating herself may seem like an obvious device, but it also adds to the film's sense of sadness and frustration, because Alice knows all too well the power of self-expression. ""Still Alice"" is about how she reacts to her own deterioration–how she constantly reassesses it and figures out how to cope. She doesn't always do it with quiet dignity, which is refreshing; sometimes she even uses the disease to manipulate those around her or get out of a social occasion she'd rather avoid. But it's also about how her family reacts in unexpected ways. Her eldest daughter, Anna (a stiff Kate Bosworth), a prim and perfectly coiffed lawyer who married well, doesn't handle Alice's illness as well as her free-spirited youngest daughter, Lydia (an excellent Kristen Stewart), who's moved to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming an actress. (The middle child, a son played by Hunter Parrish, is also on the verge of his own impressive career as a doctor). Adding to the poignancy is the fact that Glatzer was diagnosed with ALS in 2011 after a decade of making independent films with his partner, Westmoreland, including the 2006 hit ""Quinceanera."" Surely, he is all too familiar with the struggle of remaining creative and vital. The fact that this is a personal story, earnestly told and filled with hope, ultimately is what shines through with great clarity.

Permalink",False,"This film has so many good qualities, I desperately wanted to love it and be engrossed in it. However, I left the cinema disappointed. Julianne Moore's performance lifts what is an average film just above average, but it is not enough to mask the difficulty which the writers and director have had with showing the real struggle of an Alzheimer's sufferer. The camera work makes you believe that Moore is trapped in her own world and becomes more trapped as her disease progresses, the close ups and camera movement bring her affliction to life and you can really sympathize with her loss of memory.

The film directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland details a college professors (Juliane Moore) struggle with the early onset of Alzheimer's disease as she fights to maintain a life reliant upon her intelligence and intellect. The speed with which she loses the memories she holds dearest have a profound affect upon her husband (Alec Baldwin) two daughters (Kate Bosworth & Kristen Stewart) and son (Hunter Parrish), as they struggle to come to terms with Moore's Illness.

This is unfortunately the only thing impressive about this film, the other characters seem to be ignored in a way which is puzzling. In a film such as this I would have expected a more family based trauma which highlights the severe affects which Alzheimer's can have. Instead the singular and individual nature of the film made it dull in places and hard to relate to a failing memory, particularly being a young man. It seemed to remain within the boundaries of what it wanted to be and did not express anything past what people would already know about Alzheimer's. The nonchalant nature of Alec Baldwin and Kate Bosworth's characters seemed too forced and deliberate, and though Kristen Stewart was not the worst thing about this film she did not add much, other than her constantly morose face.

Everything felt one dimensional and I struggled to be engaged by the script which at times was irrelevant and obtuse. Overall, the film will be remembered for Moore's sensational performance and not much else. Which is a real shame, as behind Moore is a story that would resonate with many families who go through medical ordeals and is just not captured in the right light."

Permalink",True,"Well, this is my first film review ever, but after seeing ""Still Alice"" I thought I have something to say. I'm not any critic or writer, I just love movies.

Before watching this film, I had few hopes about it: brilliant acting of Julianne Moore (which I got), touching storyline and some kind of moral (which I probably missed). I understand why

J. Moore got Oscar, she's wonderful. Yet I must say that I wasn't a big fan of her acting before this film. But the whole movie was disappointing for me. There are holes in the plot, the main story is touching, but not enough explicated. The characters seemed to be forgotten, for example, her daughter was diagnosed with Alzheimer's too, but it seemed that it didn't mean anything and wasn't mentioned again. Alice's husband, who was showed as loving and caring, after all decided to leave, and again there is no explanation. And the ending was... eh. I understand that in this kind of movie it's difficult to come up with fair end of story, because there cannot be ""happy ending"" - it's a disease, but I still hoped for something...These complaints are all about storyline. Actors (excepts J. Moore and A. Baldwin) were pretty average, but director work and music were fine.

I do not regret watching this film but I'm kind of skeptical even though the story is touching and thought-provoking and I cannot rate this film 10 just because it's about such terrible disease. Afterall there are something left in my head and maybe after some time I will have to say something different about it.

Permalink",False,"This is a tough watch, especially if you have seen - or are seeing - someone you love slide into the abyss that is Alzheimer's or dementia. STILL ALICE necessarily telescopes her decline from articulate college professor through absent-minded mom to zombie. Her loving husband (Alec Baldwin) has a hard time balancing her care with his own dynamic career. One of her daughters is busy with new-born twins, but her favourite daughter (Kristen Stewart), struggling to get noticed by theatre directors, is the one who grieves the most as her mother loses her memory, loses her identity.

STILL ALICE is clearly of a piece with IRIS (Judi Dench, 2001) and AWAY FROM HER (Julie Christie, 2006) - an accidental trilogy of movies dealing with dementia. IRIS was the most full-on and harrowing; AWAY FROM HER was subtle and poignant. STILL ALICE is short on subtlety and clumsily paced. And this is not Julianne Moore's finest performance: she should have won awards for THE HOURS or FAR FROM HEAVEN. It's tempting to think that her Oscar this year was an award for Alzheimer's, which needs all the publicity - and all the funding - it can get."

Permalink",False,"As my favourite film critic, Mark Kermode, says: ""I have no problem with a weepy from the get go"", there is lots to be found in movies that want through some tough real life obstacles to take you through an emotional journey and that want to pull on your heartstrings. Still Alice definitely falls into that genre and succeeds amazingly in doing that, so much so that its core problem doesn't come out until the very end of the movie.

How does it succeed? Well you can't possibly talk much without addressing Moore's performance. I have been a fan of her forever, as everybody has been, and this is definitely some of the best work she has done, the culmination of her stunning career. A performance that has layers upon layers to it and doesn't fall into acting gimmicks or ""give-me-an-oscar"" scenes. We have multiple moments in the movie where the camera sticks to her for minutes and it is incredible how much, even without any camera movement, she holds the screen on her own. That is something that really not many actors are capable of. Also very good is all the cast around her, especially, in my opinion, Alec Baldwin who isn't given a lot to do, but does it flawlessly. The directors mold the cast and the excellent screenplay into a very fluent drama, that has both great emotional heights, but more than that, where the film really succeeds, is the small, intimate moments where even the most simple things seem to fall apart.

Now going back to what I said in the introduction was the core problem of the movie: a weepy has to pull on your heartstrings, but it can't, absolutely only do that and unfortunately that is what Still Alice is doing for 95% of its duration. I really don't mean this mean-fully, because as I said the drama is so good and natural throughout, despite one or two of enormous clichéd stumbles, that you don't realize until the end it is doing only that. Yet, it does not make any statement or doesn't look at its material with a solid perspective. I understand that it may be the filmmakers' attitude to portray the situation without being intrusive, but in this particular situation you are doing it and only manipulating me without giving me any payback. Look at this year's ""Fault in our Stars"", which I loved, it did pull on heartstrings and manipulate you (I'm not intending manipulate in a bad way, it is what movies do, but as I said there has to be a payback), but it did that and made a dam huge statement, so much so, that right from the first minute you understood it was a solid take on its material, something that Still Alice only flirts with.

Yet, I don't want to understate the movie's quality, it being definitely high."

Permalink",False,"In ""Still Alice"", Julianne Moore stars as Dr. Alice Howland, a Columbia linguistics professor, who becomes a victim of early onset Alzheimer's. What's unusual about Howland's diagnosis, is that it's genetically based. Statistically, middle-aged people (like the 50 year old Howland) are not the usual candidates for Alzheimer's. When we think of most Alzheimer's victims, they are usually over 70 and there's nothing very dramatic about their slow decline which President Reagan referred to as the ""sunset of my life."" The decision to depict a 50ish victim of Alzheimer's appears to be twofold: 1) the character can be easily identified with by a middle-aged, middle-class audience; and 2) the progression of the disease in a middle-aged person is much more apparent (and dramatic), than someone who is elderly and already retired.

""Still Alice"" plays out almost like a horror story (which of course it is in a sense). In reality, as noted above, there's nothing very dramatic about Alzheimer's--it's a long slog as family members of the afflicted can well attest. Nonetheless, it was necessary on the part of the film's scenarists to compress events so that the narrative proceeds in a compelling manner.

The film is most engrossing the way in which it catalogs the protagonist's slow and subtle loss of her faculties. It begins when Dr. Howland forgets a word while giving a lecture. Later, while jogging on the Columbia campus, she suddenly loses her direction and finds herself lost for a few minutes. The narrative proceeds with meetings with her neurologist, who eventually confirms the rare, genetic diagnosis. When she informs her physician researcher husband, John (Alec Baldwin), he initially is in denial and refuses to accept what she's telling him. Only when the neurologist shows him the direct evidence from his wife's brain scan, does he finally believe in the inevitability of her condition.

The film's most dramatic moment is perhaps the most contrived. Early on, Howland decides to leave a video message to herself in the future, when her disease has progressed toward its final stages. The video instructs her to look for a bottle of sleeping pills in a bedroom dresser drawer and take all of them, while no one is there. The preplanned suicide try is thwarted when a housekeeper shows up and Howland is startled, dropping all the pills on the bathroom floor and forgetting what she was doing with the pills in the first place.

Eventually, Howland becomes more and more confused. While at the family beach house, she can't find the bathroom. The film makes the point that the disease progresses slowly—she has her good and bad days. At one point, Dr. Howland is able to deliver a lecture to Alzheimer's victims in which she describes how she attempts to maintain her dignity, despite the inevitable complete loss of her faculties. Eventually, things do get worse. After attending a play that her daughter is performing in, she's unable to recognize her after the performance.

Some may say that the husband thinks only of himself when he contemplates accepting a job offer with the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. When he asks her if she's ""okay with leaving,"" it's already too late—Alice thinks he's talking about leaving the yogurt shop they've been eating ice cream in. Is it right to condemn John? I think not as none of us who have not had to care for an Alzheimer's victim, should sit in judgment.

Andrew O'Hehir of Salon Magazine notes how the husband and daughter react to Howland's deterioration: ""She is nicely balanced by Baldwin and Stewart, who serve as a Kübler-Ross Greek chorus, first seeking to deny the obvious transformation in Alice, then trying to bargain with it and contain it."" Not all the critics agreed that the supporting players were fleshed out enough. Stephen Holden of the NY Times remarks, ""the problem is that the film, concentrating on the accurate portrayal of Alice's condition, leaves the other characters undeveloped, and their social and domestic milieu hastily sketched. The test of realism in a movie like this — the thing that would separate it from a conventional, made-for-television disease melodrama — is whether you can imagine lives for the secondary characters when they aren't on screen.""

Whether the secondary characters are undeveloped or not, it's Julianne Moore's superlative performance that carries the film. While ""Still Alice"" obfuscates the daily and tedious grind of living with Alzheimer's, the chronology of the process of deterioration, is ably and engrossingly highlighted."

Permalink",True,"Still Alice (2014)is an instant classic movie, one of the best movies of2014 hands down. The film tells the story of Alice, a brilliant professor that is diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50. Terrified of the future, and the fear of forgetting the life she's created, ""Still Alice"" reflects not only on the ramifications of knowing such knowledge of your eventual demise, but how it affects those who know and love you. If your loved one was stricken with such an illness, would you, rather could you stand by their side no matter what? It's easy to answer with the socially acceptable response until you're faced with such a question. It's wonderful film that has wonderful acting by Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart. Its shinning acting goes to Julianne Moore and Kristen Stewart are nothing short of magnificent in this emotional drama that stands the test of time. It can feel like a life-time movie because of its production but overlook that and you will see a wonderful drama that deserves to be watched many times and also makes you think. It's going to hit home with many people too that deal with this disease daily, it's a wonderful movie that's bound to get tons of praise in award season. It's truly a classic in every way. 10/10 instant classic movie

Permalink",False,"Alzheimer's is such a heartwrenching disease to witness because you're essentially witnessing the deterioration of a person's self; in extreme cases, all the memories a person has cherished and all the knowledge they've worked to accumulate over the years evaporates into nothing and you're left with the shell of a person. At one point in Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's ""Still Alice,"" our titular character, played by Julianne Moore, actually states ""I'd rather have cancer,"" echoing what I have long told my friends when we discuss certain diseases. Cancer robs you of your health and your physical appearance, but at least most of what you've accumulated with your life on Earth would still be in tact.

Moore plays an incomparably talented professor, who has worked tirelessly, obtaining her credentials to be one of the most revolutionary roles in linguistics, teaching at Columbia University and writing a groundbreaking novel on the field. She is a loving wife to John (Alec Howland), and a mother to her eldest Anna (Kate Bosworth), the middle son Tom (Hunter Parrish - both of whom college educated - and the outlier Lydia (Kristen Stewart), who has decided to live on her own and pursue her dreams of an actress, much to the dismay of her mother (a conflict that is displayed in a manner that leaves me with nothing but the utmost empathy). Alice, over time, notices through a series of small but disconcerting instances that she is experiencing memory loss, and decides to begin regularly seeing an neurologist.

Through only a couple of tests, the neurologist discovers that, despite Alice's young age and positive health record, she has early onset Alzheimer's, the rare variation of the disease that has the ability to spread through genetics. Alice is dumbfounded, but there's little she or her family can do but watch her state deteriorate and hopefully bottom out at a level that still sees her as a functioning human being. Alice winds up quitting her job as a professor, and we witness her decline, from simple things like losing little words in conversations to getting lost in her own house, not being able to find the bathroom.

""Still Alice"" is a frightening film; as a teenager who is experiencing the inevitable in watching his parents age and move onto being senior-citizens, as well as just losing a grandparent, it's painful to watch such affecting and realistic depictions of such a crippling illness. However, with all the films concerning cancer, cancer treatment, and the effects the illness has on people and families, remarkably few films have put Alzheimer's under a magnifying glass and showed the agony that entails with its diagnosis and eventual progression.

Thankfully, the writing and directing team of Glatzer and Westmoreland are up to the challenge, and they are grateful to have Moore under their belt as somebody who can bring life to such a disease. Moore effectively communicates a vibrant, passionate personality early on in the film, and makes a slow and gradual turn for the worse, as in the later scenes, where her facial expressions effectively communicate that there is nothing going on in Alice's head in a frighteningly human manner. Her gradual progression, and depiction in general, is consistently natural and never over-the-top; the agony she communicates shows deep frustration with herself and something she cannot control, again, in a manner that displays the two most crippling human conflicts of all, which are the conflict with one's self and the inevitable.

Glatzer and Westmoreland also don't allow for basic emotional manipulation to take place during the course of the film. Never does cutesy music chime in, nor montages inserted to trivialize or simplify Alice's struggle. The most impacting, emotionally-moving scenes exist in fragments or one liners, with one of the strongest coming in a pair of scenes concerning Alice's lost phone. The fact that the writing/directing duo could make such an impact possible shows their delicate craft and their ability to avoid common pitfalls and clichés by taking an alternate route to gain access to the audience's emotions, especially for such an underexplored topic.

""Still Alice"" isn't an incredible film, as it's still a drama that is a bit too direct in its depictions and still a hair too cutesy, especially in its conclusion. However, make no mistake, this is still an important film with a great performance at its center. Unlike with ""Black or White,"" where I stated we, the audience, kind of had to settle with the marginal demonization of some of the black characters in the film but still needed to say that we, as a collective whole, wanted films about interracial relationships and family conflicts, ""Still Alice"" isn't a film to settle for, but a film to embrace and then discuss afterwards."

Permalink",True,"It seems that in life the way it develops, we are bound by chapters that define who we are, our priorities and ability to adjust is very important. We could categorize the childhood as a primary time of learning and foundation setting to our sense of self and who we become in the future. When we are very little we relay on our parents to show us the way and guide us through this difficult time of self discovery. In age 25 to 40 we hopefully chosen the careers we wanted, found the one we want to spend the rest of our life with and have kids. From 40's to 60's we start to feel as our bodies deteriorate, there might be sense of regret setting in for inability to accomplish the things we wanted in life. Man slowly start to loose their interest in things which defined their masculinity, like sex and often willingness to compete in physical strength. Women go through their menopause, slowly do not feel desired by men. Often cut their hair short which brings in them sense of masculinity, where finely they can express their masculine site without a shame of being called the ""L"" word. There is nothing more to prove, their job as a sex object is done. From 60's to 80's and if you lucky to 90's we go back to the child like state. Our memory deteriorates, we loose our hair our teeth and power over of control in our sphincter muscles creating the feeling of inner child like behavior. We could theoretically say that we start as children and in a way we go back to that same state in the end before we die. The most heart wrenching thing is to watch someone you love or care about, skip some of those stages in life and and deteriorate in front of our eyes much before their time. We feel like somehow the natural progression of life has been violated.

Julianne Moore delivered last year two Oscar worthy performances. First one as a washed up actress trying to remained relevant in youth obsessed Hollywood working on her mother issues in ""Maps to the Stars"" directed by David Cronenberg and much more mellow yet dramatically powerful portrait of a alzheimer's disease stricken linguistic professor, who at an early age 50 starts to experience a deterioration of her memories and her identity. Now, at the first glance the performance in ""Maps to the Stars"" seems more flashy and intense and their for immediately impact full on the audience. I also thought that it will be sure contender for the best female Oscar nomination, even though the world of Hollywood industry has not been painted there with very flattering brush. After watching both movies I must say I get it now, why ""Still Alice"" got the note over ""Maps to the Stars"".

Anyone whoever witnessed a deterioration of a loved one from ether cancer or any other illness will, connect very strongly with this material. The film starts with a showcase of Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) as a sharp, smart and very successful linguistic professor with a lot of confidence in her ability to articulate her thoughts. As the film progresses so does the illness and for someone who prides themselves on their knowledge and intelligence, inability to remember things takes away their identity one grey cell at the time. Of course this is not only her own journey but her whole family is going through the whole ordeal together. Her husband played by Alec Baldwin in the beginning is loving and caring, but with time and Alice deterioration in to a child like state, looses his faith and starts to focus more on his career, thinking that she anyway will not know what is happening around her. Her kids, Kristen Stewart playing Lydia a wane be actress in the family of academics is fighting for the right to be herself and not follow her parents footsteps. The relationship between her and her mother is complicated one though they seems to be the most close from the whole family. Kate Bosworth playing Anna is the miss perfect on the way with twins, always have conflicts with her younger less structured sister. All the performances help immensely in obtaining true believability of this piece. Director's Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland together made some interesting choices in terms of how they told the story, but also how it is shown on the screen. For example in the first two times wham Alice is being diagnosed with Alzheimer they do not show the doctor to us. We only see Alice discovering this bad news for herself and this is how the story is told from her point of view. The music is used in very brilliant way as it changes throughout the movie, as the illness takes over and deterioration began the music is scattered and unmethodical. The choice of the name of our protagonist is also used in purposeful way and just like ""Alice in the Wonderland"" Julianne Moore character spirals in to the rabbit hole of unknown, without the thing that made her who she is, her intellect. You will surely share a tear here and there, due to the subject matter and truly wonderful, sometime underplayed performance by Julianne Moore. In this film her character deteriorates too soon considering her age being 50 and that is an additional reason why we feel sense of melancholia when the movie is over. I am pretty sure that she will get an Oscar for this role specially considering that she already picked up the British Bafta Award and a Golden Globe as well.

Go check out this film because performances that honest do not happen every year. Last year was a great year for Julianne Moore and slowly she starts to catch up behind Meryl Streep as the greatest actress of her generation.

Permalink",True,"I just finished watching this great film and I must say that it was remarkable. It is what I would consider to be a simple film. There aren't too many characters and there are no subplots, which I was very happy about. It seems like with a lot of recent family movies that feature an ensemble cast, they always seem to get bogged down with subplots featuring all of the extra characters and it's really annoying.

This film is about a woman named Alice played by the great Julianne Moore who has spent most of her life building a successful career as a linguist professor at Columbia while also maintaining a loving marriage and raising three children. The main child that we get to know is Lydia, played very well by Kristen Stewart. She is the youngest child who has moved across the country to Los Angeles in order to pursue a career as an actress. I honestly thought that we would follow her a little more, showing her in L.A. with her roommates and possibly a romantic interest, and I can't even begin to say how thrilled I am that that didn't happen. Again, so many other movies do that nowadays and it never ends well.

Anyways, the movie very gently and respectfully shows us what it's like for a person to not only receive the devastating news that they have early onset Alzheimers but, also someone who spent her whole life studying words and communication. It shows her first symptoms, her initial diagnosis and then unflinchingly, we see her eventual decline. I wrote ""spoilers"" in the title of this review because I wanted to mention a part of the movie where Alice tells her husband that she would rather have cancer because then she would not feel like she might embarrass herself, or that she would no longer even be herself anymore. the husband tells her not to feel that way but, can we really blame her? We would probably feel the same way as she does even though we all know that cancer is horrible.

I don't think anyone can really know what it's like to go through this but, after watching this film, I feel like I understand it very well and that's a testament to the makers of it. Again, I'm very happy that we got to see this film made in such a simple way, without any over the top drama, or gratuitous conflicts thrown in. I must mention though that the reason why I gave this film an 8 instead of a 10 is because I also would've loved to see Alice's son a little more, and his relationship with his mother. I also think that it should've explored more of what Alice wanted done when she reached a point of no longer being able to take care of herself. Not too give anything away but, we do see that she doesn't want to be a burden to anyone or to end up in a nursing facility. The movie could have done more with that.

I have to say that although Julianne Moore did a fantastic job, I was really blown away by Kristen Stewart's performance. I can't think of any other actress breathing more life into that role than she did. Lydia was also just a fantastic character. The way she reacts to her mother's illness is so heartbreaking but, also so strong. There's a scene in particular when the children are first told about the diagnosis and while the other two children are confused and shocked, Lydia doesn't seem too surprised by it as she had noticed her mother's slipping memory. She very boldly handles her mother's affliction in a way that I think we should all aspire to, if ever been put in such a terrible position. There's an amazing scene where Lydia apologizes to her mother about an argument they had had the day before. Alice doesn't even remember it and I think that showed how everyone should be more forgiving to our loved ones, not just because they might be suffering with something but, also because it's just a good idea to forgive our parents. They won't be around forever and so it's sad to carry around grudges towards them.

The movie is a must see for anyone, and I highly recommend it.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice tells the story of Alice, a family involved mother and wife who is suddenly diagnosed with dementia at a very early age. Alice is in for the fight of her life as she struggles to maintain who she is all while struggling with idea of what she may become. Still Alice is a very emotionally charged drama that features Julianne Moore in, what could be, the best performance she has ever given. The supporting cast includes Alex Baldwin and Kristen Stewart, who turn in good performances but if we're comparing them to Moore, they are outclassed and out-acted. This is truly Moore's film, she takes it on her shoulders and runs with it. Still Alice will definitely strike a chord with everyone, especially if you know someone going through this terrible disease or have any idea of what it can do to you. It is truly heart-wrenching to watch as Alice loses touch of herself and her family due to this horrible disease. While the film does tug on emotional chords throughout most of the film, it starts to become redundant by the third act and leaves little to surprise regarding where the film was going and how it was going to end. As far as writing and directing are concerned, Still Alice is a flimsy story that has wobbly legs going into it but the sheer intensity that Julianne Moore brings to the story is more than enough for it to stand on its own two feet. Overall, Still Alice is one of the more simplistic films of this year's Oscar race. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about this film other than Julianne Moore and her brilliant, touching and thought-provoking performance."

Julianne Moore has an alright performance here.

What I don't like, the movie feels too polished, I don't care about most of the characters besides Alice and maybe her husband to a certain extent. Kristen Stewart's character could've been interesting.

I feel like 'Still Alice' could've had more plot twists and a deeper storyline.

Permalink",False,"After reading Lisa Genova's ""Still Alice"" novel and being absolutely devastated (in both positive and negative ways) by it, I was chomping at the bit to see what Hollywood would do with the story. What I found was that the film version of ""Still Alice"" is a solid portrayal of the novel's events, albeit one that stumbles in a few key areas preventing it from being spectacular.

For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Alice Howland (Julianna Moore), an esteemed university professor who begins forgetting things that normally come easy to her. A word in a lecture disappears from her mind, as does the directions of her daily run around campus. After a trip to see a neurologist, Alice is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease and forced to confront the debilitating effects the illness will have on what had previously been her most esteemed facet: her mind.

At its core, ""Still Alice"" is a very emotional tale of loss, acceptance, and courage. What Alice goes through will be alarming to all viewers across the board, and likely prompt some internal dialogues of the scary and uncomfortable variety. What this film and the novel really get right, however, is the inclusion of family into the equation. It's one thing to see Alice struggling on her own, but a whole new kind of heartbreak to see it affect husband John (Alec Baldwin) as well as her three grown children (played by Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish, and Kristen Stewart). Each of these individuals relates to Alice on a different emotional level and provide amounts of support and difficult as her condition deteriorates.

I really wanted to give this film a higher rating, as the base material certainly deserves it, but there were a few missteps along the way that prevented it from truly being something spectacular:

-First and foremost, more time was needed to show Alice as a successful professor and ""thinker"", if you will. The real emotional impact of the story is how Alice is losing the one thing in life she has always depended on (her powerful mind), and that is the crux of most of the emotion. I wish this film had taken a bit more time in establishing that, even if the runtime needed to be increased (it's only about an hour and forty minutes as-is). -Also, I enjoyed the original ending of the book more so than the path directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland took it down. Genova's ending didn't pull any punches, to be sure, but it also provided a sense of hope in way is ultimately a hopeless situation (Alzheimer's Disease does not yet have a cure). This film tries to do a similar thing in a different capacity, but perhaps doesn't quite nail that aspect as well.

Overall, ""Still Alice"" is a solid film depicting the rare instance of early-onset Alzheimer's. It may lack some of the emotional punch of the source novel, but that could be mitigated if the book hasn't been read before the watch. I can easily see why Moore took home Best Actress at the Oscars for her Alice portrayal, as she steals the film in many ways."

Permalink",True,"Alice (Julianne Moore) is one of the top linguists in the world. She loves her career and her own intellect (in a nice way). In the first scene we are introduced to most of the characters except for her daughter Lydia (Kristen Stewart) who is an actress who has to pay money to have people watch her. Alice discovers she has a rare genetic form of Alzheimer, one that she can pass on to her three children. If they have the gene, it is a 100% chance they get it.

During the film we watch Alice struggle, degrade, and leave notes to herself, provides for an interesting twist.

Julianne Moore won an Oscar for her performance. I definitely think Kristen Stewart does far better in a support role, than a lead. Alec Baldwin had relatively small role for the spouse. The family helps out in what amounts to a sad film about the end of life, although the film never enters the more difficult, end stages of Alzheimer. The film is secular. No one prays for help.

I couldn't hep think about another film, ""You're Not You"" with Hilary Swank that received less notice, about a dying ALS patient. I think if you enjoy one of these films you would enjoy the other.

Permalink",False,"Saw 'Still Alice' to see how Julianne Moore's universally praised performance would fare and also to see how the film would do portraying an illness as cruel as Alzheimers. Having seen myself what it does to people from singing Christmas carols recently at a care home, and having had a family friend who succumbed to it a few years ago.

Finally getting round to see it, there was a good deal to admire about 'Still Alice', and there is more to it than an award-sweeping performance. On the other hand, a large part of me expected something much more, it is a brave attempt but doesn't explore the illness and how it affects loved ones as well as the sufferer enough. Which is a really big shame because the potential and ingredients are all there, the execution was inconsistent.

Can say absolutely nothing wrong about Julianne Moore, whose magnificent performance, one of heart-wrenching subtlety and dignity delivered with incredible intelligence, is what especially elevates 'Still Alice' to a higher level. As to whether she deserved the Oscar, my answer is yes for one of the overall best performances that year and she is tied with Rosamund Pike in 'Gone Girl' as my win for the Best Actress category that year.

It is not just Moore who gives a quality performance. Alec Baldwin is just as powerful and Kristen Stewart proves that she is capable of a good (great even) performance when she has a character and material that are halfway decent (not the case with the 'Twilight' films and 'Snow White and the Huntsman', but the case here).

The film looks good visually, while the music is hauntingly beautiful and there is an honesty and poignancy to the writing, effectively chilling early premonitions and some interesting, illuminating facts.

However, most of the characters are cardboard cut-outs, particularly those of the children. Of Stewart, Hunter Parrish and Kate Bosworth's characters, the only one to have any kind of meat is Stewart's. Can barely remember those for the other two, especially Bosworth's who is also rather shallow.

Too much of the script is under-baked, too coy and lacks subtlety, some of it almost like a sermon. There is not much new to what is already known about Alzheimers and how it's portrayed in other films to much better and more consistent effect.

Much more could have been done with the too bland and trivialised portrayal of Alzheimers (even though there is emotional impact), we know already how cruel it is but we don't properly get to see how devastating the illness is. Largely because the family relationships and how it affects them, as well as the full effects of the illness itself (far more complex and devastating than the film shows), are under-explored. When there are attempts at these, they do vary in how much they ring true or whether they're contrived). And the daily struggles glossed over completely, it's not just the sufferer who suffers and the carers deserve better than that.

Overall, decent and worth watching but should have been much more. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

Permalink",False,"A good film that deals with its topic maturely and sensitively, Julianne Moore carries her character gracefully and wholly convincingly. I also don't want to pass up the opportunity to give Kristen Stewart some rare praise, as she takes on a role far better suited to her than most, though it isn't an overwhelmingly challenging one.

It's unfortunate that in spite of the film's overall integrity, there are some scenes that look like they were extracted directly from a Lifetime daytime TV movie. Otherwise, the film is a fairly simple but most effective examination of Alzheimer's Disease.

Permalink",True,"Two reasons, pushed me to watch the movie - Incomplete achievement ""Highlights 2015 Oscars"", and, in fact, the very same Oscar for the main female role, which went to Julianne Moore.

Movies about bodily ailments are always incredibly piercing and watch them simply impossible. Sometimes awareness of the problem prevails over the artistic value of the tape and hides all the shortcomings. ""Still Alice"" - оne of these and tells us the story of very smart woman who was struck by Alzheimer's disease.

The game of actors, led by Julianne Moore, is quite worthy of attention. I must admit, her heroine came out theatrical-exemplary. From manners and movement, to extinction, blunt points of view, gray eyes and phlegmatic mood.

It would be very interesting to see how the personality is destroyed by the deposition of amyloid in the brain, but instead we were given a tape with mediocre dialogs, not remembered. The film is full of a lot of secondary moments, which could be abandoned, making the narrative less tractable. So, the action on the screen and the dialogues are realistic, there is no doubt that everything that happens, but the work of art itself turned out to be boring and uninteresting. Psychologically the film is much weaker than others about people with disabilities.

As a result, the film is interesting, although not the best. It is quite suitable for viewing alone or with loved ones.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice follows Alice(Moore) and her family(Stewart,Baldwin) as they deal with her early onset Alzheimer's disease. I have yet to see a movie that follows the things one dealing with Alzheimer's goes through. I never really put thought into how it would feel to go through it and Moore displays it in a way that's believable. Knowing a family member that went through dementia it really struck me in a way I doubt it would have otherwise.

The story mostly focuses on Moore's character and I think it could have gained something by giving some more screen time to the family members. Even though it focuses on Moore it is not a bad thing, she does a wonderful job in this film. The simplicity with which she shows Alice going through her daily life as it gets harder and harder for her to is very well done. You can really feel the confusion that her character is experiencing.

Overall it's a simple story that is told and shown in a believable way and has some great acting by all those involved. I just wish some more screen time was there for the rest of the family."

The plot is pretty interesting as well. The progression of time is portrayed pretty well, so it doesn't feel rushed. For the most part it seemed realistic, although who am I to judge it based on that? I don't know what it'd be like to get Alzheimers. But I could understand why certain things would happen at certain times so nothing was ever far fetched or out of place in my mind.

Because I saw it from close by, when the health of my grandfather was deteriorating year after year. The beginning stage of Alzheimer is already confusing when you realize that your family member is forgetting a lot of things and asks a lot of time the same questions. And it only gets worse. At the end my grandfather would ask me the same question over and over again, and even though it drives you crazy you have to remain friendly. While the physical health is still good it's mentally that it doesn't work anymore. My grandmother actually died from the stress the disease of her husband brought to her. It's a nasty disease that affects the whole family. Still Alice is a beautiful and sad movie to watch. Julianne Moore did a very good job playing the Alzheimer patient. The rest of the cast did a perfect job as well. I really hope I will never get that disease and be a burden to my wife. That's why this movie scared me more then any other horror movie.

Then cut to sunny Cal. The blue sky and palm trees is not clique. Having lived in Los Angeles, many of the places are just like that. On to the beach, some may have a small point there - the beach lacks coastline, but then the focus was Alice - feeling alone. To include generous cast of familiar beach-types is not part of the equation. Now the interior scenes actually commends praises instead of disapproval. The sets in the house in New York recreates what a real family's home looks like for busy,productive people. It is authentically old as housing in the Big Apple are old. They could have thrown a handsome, stylish dig together, but it would be less authentic. The beach home has nice woodsy walls and floors, shewn with familiar throw rugs and comfy couches, was there anything wrong ? For my vote, this movie shows restraints and honesty, the cinematography is a huge part of that."

Permalink",False,"With a truly memorable performance by one of the most beautiful, wonderful and incredibly, most talented actresses of all time, Still Alice is a melancholy and touching tale which is perfectly well executed and realistic.

Based on the novel by the same name written by Lisa Genova, Still Alice tells the story of Alice Howland; a professor of languages, married with three children, who discovers she is suffering from a disease that seems to be Alzheimer and later is confirmed that it is.

The plot deals with the struggle that she and her family suffered during the progression of the disease, as she slowly begins to forget words, locations and even their loved ones.

Written and directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, the film maintains full focus on Alice from start to finish despite using an usual sentimental approach in these stories.

Still Alice features an interesting cast with Julianne Moore, Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish, and although the support work is good, Moore's performance here is so remarkable that it overshadows everything else in the Movie although Baldwin has played her husband brilliantly, while Stewart, Bosworth & Parrish play the role of their children and end up doing a good job.

As a final note, Still Alice deals with a sensitive subject with compassion and sensible and features Julianne Moore in a sublime way.

It's an amazing performance, in every scene she enters viewers brains and we feel her pain.

I did not expect it to end on a happy ending, the ending is predictable but it very realistic, please let Julliane finally win the Oscar, being robbed 4 times is too much. My vote is 7.

Eventually Alice's doctor diagnoses her with early onset Alzheimer's Disease.

This is a fine depiction of Alzheimer's performed by the compelling Julianne Moore. Kristen Stewart puts in a couple of good scenes. Both Bosworth and Baldwin are very solid. The movie needs something to elevate it. I like the section where Alice is desperately looking for her phone. The next morning they find it but John tells his daughter that it was a month ago. It puts the audience in Alice's perspective. The movie needs more of those moments. For example, Alice confuses Anna for her sister. It would be interesting to put in another actress as Anna and then put in Bosworth after somebody tells Alice that she's her daughter. It would also be interesting to cut up some of the scenes to create confusion just as it's experienced by Alice. That would add something special."

Permalink",False,"As more and more people live longer and longer, dementia in its various forms is becoming more commonplace and it is understandable that the subject should be increasingly portrayed in films and novels and films inspired by novels. ""Still Alice"" is based on a novel by Lisa Genova and written and directed by Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer.

What makes it different from other films about dementia, such as ""Iris"" (2001) and ""Away From Her"" (2006), is that, whereas the earlier works looked at the illness in old age, the eponymous Alice Howland is just 50 when she is diagnosed with early onset familial Alzheimer's Disease. The situation is particularly tragic both because Alice is a professor of linguistics and each of her three children has a 50/50 chance of becoming a victim.

There is no way that such a movie is going to have a happy ending, but it is compelling watching because of an excellent script and a terrific performance by Julianne Moore in the title role. Moore has rightly won a whole bunch of accolades including the Academy Award for Best Actress.

The first standout scene comes when Alice is out running and cannot work out where she is. Among many other powerful scenes, two knockout sequences are when Alice's youngest daughter (Kristen Stewart) asks her what her condition feels like and when Alice addresses an Alzheimer's Association event on her condition. The use of smart phones and computers make this a very contemporary examination of dementia and one of the most unsettling pieces of narrative is when Alice accidentally discovers a message from her earlier self.

Ultimately this is not a film about illness so much as one about identity. Memory is critical to identity and, as we saw in the very different movie ""Before I Go To Sleep"", we are defined by what we do and do not remember. When Alice loses all her memories, is she still Alice?"

Permalink",False,"You've probably seen the previews for Still Alice, the story of a middle-aged woman's battle with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. You might be wondering if Still Alice rises above the level of the typical ""disease of the week"" television movie. I can tell you this: It does, but it's not Best Picture material. (Since it wasn't nominated for Best Picture, I guess it doesn't matter, but let's just say it's not one of those pictures the Academy overlooked.) The real treat here is Julianne Moore's performance. This should be the role to (finally) win her the Best Actress trophy.

I've always liked Julianne Moore. She possesses some of the same attributes as Meryl Streep. She's not the classic Hollywood beauty. She's achieved her success the old-fashioned way – by simply being one of the best actresses in the history of motion pictures. Here, Moore creates a sympathetic character at the outset, then lets us burrow deeper into the despondency of one of the most taxing of man's physical maladies. There is no cure for Alzheimer's. Friends and family are obligated to helplessly tend the afflicted. But Still Alice doesn't wallow in self-pity. Yes, we feel sorry for Moore's character, but never does she beg victimhood.

Moore plays Dr. Alice Howland, a Columbia University professor of linguistics, married to John, himself a college professor. Her disease begins innocently enough when she can't remember a word – right in the middle of a lecture class. Soon, she gets lost while jogging through very familiar territory near her home and work. She is diagnosed with early-onset and familial Alzheimer's – meaning it's passed down from generation to generation. This puts additional pressure on Alice's three benevolent children – all young adults.

Alec Baldwin plays the loving and supportive husband, who has a very marginal desire to not be bothered by Alice's condition and needs. For the most part, his character is sympathetic. The Howland's three children are also supportive, but the real stand-out is Kristen Stewart of Twilight fame, as middle child Lydia. In her first ""adult"" role, Stewart nails her part as the most independent-minded of the Howland kids. She's skipped college in favor of a fledgling stage career with an upstart theatre company in Los Angeles – much to the dismay of her mother. As is often the case in these situations, those closest to the Alzheimer's victim (the husband, the college-grad daughter who still lives close) find it most difficult to deal with the declining mental state of the afflicted party. It's the daughter who rarely sees her mother who accepts Alice's condition, and communicates with her on her own ever-reduced level. If anything, Alice's bout with Alzheimer's allows her to draw closer to Lydia. The final mother-daughter scene is outstanding, without being needlessly weepy.

Stewart should have received a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Her performance tops three or four of those of the nominated actresses. But again, this is Stewart's first performance in an ""adult"" film. I expect to see more from her in the future.

As for Julianne Moore, she should have won at least one Supporting Actress statuette by now (actually three, by my count – 1993's Short Cuts, 1997's Boogie Nights, and 1999's Magnolia). This time, particularly since Amy Adams wasn't even nominated for Big Eyes, the award is hers. It's well-deserved. She is one of our greatest actresses, and this performance is the crowning achievement of her career."

Permalink",False,"Still Alice is a great movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's a very powerful movie that in the space of only ninety minutes manages to make you feel a ton of sympathy and remorse for this character as she struggles with Alzeiheimer's disease, this is a very sensitive subject that sadly many people suffer with, it was certainly a very risky subject to put in to a movie and it would have to be handled very delicately, thankfully it turned out great here and the message of how serious this illness really is gets brought across perfectly. I think Julianne Moore and Kristen Stewart needed more scenes together, that's my only real problem with this movie, it's ninety minutes long but it easily could have gone on for another twenty to develop these two characters relationship, it ends with the two of them together but I would have liked to have seen this continue some more, Stewart had great potential in this role but she was sadly underused, and the credits came up too soon. This kind of film couldn't have possibly worked unless every actor gave one hundred percent, and thankfully everyone did, Julianne Moore delivers a breathtaking performance that got her the Academy Award she always deserved, and she has a great cast to support her, with some very powerful scenes with Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart that add an extra layer to Alice that was very necessary. Powerful, dramatic and very well acted, I would recommend Still Alice to anyone looking for a good drama.

Permalink",False,"Julianne Moore has been held as one of the greatest actresses in this generation. She managed to impress us with her performances in films such as Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Boogie Nights', 'The Hours' and the 2010 comedy- drama 'The Kids Are All Right'. In this heart-staggering drama directed by Richard Glatzer, Moore steps in foot in a role that allows her to fully embrace her immersive talent in the acting department, a role that expands the beauty of her talent. And the result pays off beautifully. Moore plays Alice Howland, a Columbia University logistics professor who finds her bonds and her relationships with her family tested when she is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Her family consists of her husband John (played by Alec Baldwin), her son Tom (played by Hunter Parrish), and her daughters Anna (played by Kate Bosworth) and Lydia (played by Kristen Stewart), along with Anna's husband Charlie (played by Shane McRae). The film journeys through her life as she struggled to adjust to her deteriorating emotional and mental conditions.

Upon watching this, it is genuinely difficult not to appreciate the incredible performance she delivers here. She gives such charm and wittiness to her character, and the emotional core she sparks into the story hits hard. As the woman develops Alzheimer's and is trying to do everything she can to make her way in life, she finds the bonds with her family including her children gradually drifting. The depiction of her illness is done in a way that is reasonably genuine and heartfelt in a way that may hit too close to home for some who have dealt with a family member who's experience it. As her Alzheimer's progress into a deeper state, she begins forgetting things and has hard times remembering things that happen moments before. One scene in particular involves her getting lost while going for a jog. Worse, the result also leads to effects on her professional life to the point of her she struggling to keep up with her job at the university. Alec Baldwin also a pretty decent job as well, serving as the supporting figure of the titular character. Lastly, in the narrative department, is the story which is nothing short of magnificent. There are some points where the movie is very uplifting, then there are points that get really emotional, but the biggest surprise Richard Glatzer brings to the story is not making it emotionally manipulative, and instead lets it move easy and the emotional atmosphere run natural. Sure, there are some moments where the film glosses over with a sappy music core. But more often than not, the emotional gravity the story delivers feels genuine and rarely contrived.

Alice is a wonderful dramatic outing with powerful performances and an intelligent direction by Richard Glatzer. It's no surprise to see that Julianne Moore won an Oscar. She really brings the life to his movie, as well as the rest of the cast. Looking for a good movie, here would be a good pick."

Permalink",True,"Why do we watch sad movies? most of us do to be moved as like watching a comedy to laugh, but some of us do to relate to and feel less alone and helpless in those particular situations. I'm sure I wasn't as moved as my grandmother was when we watched The Pianist together, probably due to the fact that she grew-up in Nazi-invaded Poland, despite coming from a catholic family, I remember seeing some tears shedding down her eyes. I remember nearly sobbing when watching Silver Linings Playbook but more of joy, joy of finally seeing a movie that said to me in a real and raw way ""hey, don't worry, you where not alone going through these bad experiences"". Now that's the true power of a movie, book or song.

See, my grandmother suffers from Lewy Body Dementia, a disease very similar to Alzheimer. She was once a bright and vivid woman until that disease stopped her from fully expressing her true self. Alzheimer and LBD are these sort of diseases that can sometimes completely turn some of the brightest and liveliest person incapacitated from there thoughts, memories and personalities. Yeah, sure, some will say that it happens to people at a late age but these people might still be around with us for a while as we wish it to be. And Still Alice isn't a made-up sad story, early-onset Alzheimer is a thing, it's rare but it's a rare thing that happens. When we went inside the cinema room, an ad concerning Alzheimer played before the movie, I then knew that at least a quarter of the people in the cinema (and the cinema was full) knew someone very close to them that had Alzheimer.

Still Alice is about a 50yr old lecturer (Julianne Moore) who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer. From the beginning of the movie, her performance is true and heartbreaking as she portrays the illness perfectly and in a stellar way through her performance as Alice's Alzheimer gradually gets worse and worse throughout the movie. Some scenes where her Alzheimer kicks in are shot in a beautiful and disturbing way by emphasizing the blur on the out-of- focus parts of the shot around her. Alec Baldwin, playing her husband, does his classic acting style and adapts it very well to his character. Then there's Kate Bosworth, Shane McRae and Hunter Parrish playing the three of the four children of the parents. Their performance are OK-ish enough as minor supporting actors. The movie, addressing such a tough subject, does feel forced to portray the family as wealthy, successful, good looking and happy. Then there's the fourth child, the cliché ugly duckling of the family, the artsy one that doesn't want to do graduate studies and wants to be an actress ...played by Kirsten Stewart... that's where we get to the tough part...

Look, let's get something out of the way, Kirsten Stewart can't act to save her own life. And the most frustrating part of it all is she's playing one of the kids who gets the major supporting role because she's Kirsten Stewart. And it's pure irony that she plays the girl that wants to be an actress because (hold the phone on this one) she can't act. It was frustrating to see one of the greatest actress of all time interact with one of the worst A-list actress of all time. That was unfortunately that one big weakness of the movie. Nevertheless, the movie was an absolute accomplishment all thanks to Julianne Moore and co-directors: Richard Glatzer & Wash Westmoreland. I remember seeing Julianne Moore in her earliest role, The Fugitive (1993) as that nurse and here she is. Go watch it.

Permalink",False,"Okay this movie is a fairly done drama film, and on a serious illness which made the film interesting to want to watch. Now so far almost every movie that starred Julianne Moore has always been very nicely done, yet this movie stuck out for an odd feeling. For some reason it seemed like there was tension on the set between a few actresses or actors, something was just not right. My team and I were watching ""Still Alice"" and at the exact part we all looked at each other saying ""Did you notice that?"", so I know it was just me feeling that way. Yes this film was pretty good, the scenes seemed to be a bit rushed, and the acting for the most part was okay.

Was this a casting issue that made the actors selected seem off or was the script that short? Just a thought but yes all and all the movie was okay. I'm just not sure that the film did the novel any justice.

Permalink",True,"Alice Howland has everything that most successful women do.She is a world-renowned professor linguistics from Columbia University.She has a wonderful family by having a great husband Dr.John Howland,who also happens to be a professors at Columbia and three grown children,all of whom have successful careers with one as a doctor,another as a lawyer and the other as a thespian.But things begin change when she later was found to have symptoms of the Alzheimer's Disease.She and her family are thoroughly tested and find a lot of pain in the situation.She then finds herself retiring early from Columbia and the on-set of her disease is seen as the story of the movie progresses.

Julianne Moore definitely provides a career performance as Alice.We see her transformation as realistically as possible from being a professor until the late stages of her disease.While the screenplay focuses more on the situation that she is facing,she manages to cover that flaw of the film by allowing the viewer to focus and empathize on her character as the story progresses.We see how she loses herself as she suffers from cognitive and memory impairment painfully.In the end,we also feel happy for her in the sense that this allowed her to somehow repair her relationship with her youngest daughter who happens to be a thespian as she decides to take care of her in the end despite not knowing much about it.

Which is even more devastating because she feels that she is defined by here intellect. Throughout the movie I couldn't understand but have empathy towards her character of losing everything that she has gained throughout her life, he memories. This is one of those movies where the pacing may seem to be a bit slow at first, but when it comes to the overall story and direction it works for the most part. And it's just saddening to watch the protagonist fight and struggle to keep her mind intact. Overall this is good movie that involves the psych with some good performances, minus Kristen Stewart.

Permalink",False,"Proving once again why she is one of our greatest living actresses, Julianne Moore earned a richly deserved Best Actress Oscar for her work in ""Still Alice,"" a poignant tale of a 50-year-old linguistics professor who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's.

Alice Howland is leading a seemingly charmed life when she is suddenly and unexpectedly cut down by a disease that we all too often think of as an exclusively late-in-life condition. In addition to her thriving and fulfilling career, this vital and intelligent woman enjoys a seemingly rock-solid marriage to a physician (Alec Bladwin), three reasonably well-adjusted adult children (Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish, Kristen Stewart) and the prospect of a couple of grandchildren on the way. All that, however, comes crashing down on her when she begins to exhibit subtle but disturbing and ultimately undeniable issues with memory and vocabulary retention. When her worst suspicions are confirmed, Alice and her loved ones are forced to come to terms with the reality of the situation and to make plans for how best to deal with it.

For Alice, the greatest fear is loss of control, identity and self, as day by day she slips ever further into mental oblivion. For her family members, the challenge is to find the means of coping with both the immediate and the long term burden of caring for Alice - and the grim prospect of eventually losing her to the disease. For John, her husband, after an initial period of denial, the answer is finally to flee to a new job in a new city, while their younger daughter, Lydia (Kristen Stewart), finds meaning by putting her own petty grievances on the back burner and ultimately embracing her role as caregiver to her mother.

Given its grim and terrifying subject matter, ""Still Alice"" could easily have sugarcoated the realities of Alice's condition and played upon the heartstrings of the viewer in an attempt to make it more palatable to an understandably anxious audience. Instead, as written and directed by Wash Westmoreland and the late Richard Glatzer, the movie, based on a book by Lisa Genova, wins us over with its matter-of-fact honesty and its determined refusal to wallow in both unwarranted optimism and tear-wringing schmaltz. Alice may indeed be facing an unspeakable tragedy, but, thanks to Moore's subtle, thoughtful performance, she evokes empathy rather than pity, understanding rather than concern.

It would be dishonest to somehow suggest that this is not a difficult film to sit through at times, for we all bring our own personal fears and experiences to it. But it seems to me an essential movie, one that opens pathways to understanding while at the same time engaging us in a very human drama on an issue so many of us will one day have to deal with, either as a victim or the loved one of a victim.

Incidentally, ""Still Alice"" makes a fine companion-piece to the equally impressive ""Away From Her,"" a 2007 film on the same topic with Julie Christie a match for Moore as the Alzheimer's-afflicted main character. Check that one out as well."

It was such a moving story of a middle-aged woman who starts to suffer Alzheimer's as she steadily deteriorates while her husband and offspring watch her. Julianne Moore deserved her Oscar for her bravely compelling performance as that woman who had a fine teaching career. Alec Baldwin is also compelling as her husband who is wrestling with how to continue his career while seeing her just lose her sense of self all over. Kristen Stewart is perhaps the most compelling of their children who, playing an actress who likes her choices despite not being the most settled of the family, makes more of a connection with her mom as the narrative goes on. In summary, we were all touched by Still Alice.

Permalink",False,"Having lived as a caregiver with a family member diagnosed with dementia and whose death certificate says that she died from Alzheimer's Disease, I was greatly affected and moved by this film. It doesn't focus on the caregivers really, but on the victim of this debilitating disease. Julianne Moore's performance is perfect. The development and progression is believable. Clearly this is due to the director and editor as well. The three put together a fantastic portrayal of someone progressively suffering from this illness. A wonderfully dramatic and cathartic scene is the one in which Alice tries to follow some instructions on a computer video. The dramatic build is perfect with an explosive climax. And there are two absolutely perfect, wonderfully touching and real moments between Alice and her husband (Alec Baldwin) in an ice cream shop. They are painfully funny and sad. Overall, fine performances by the entire cast and a very well written script. The film exists therefore as a fine film, but also as a docudrama. It's difficult watching for anyone who has lived close to this disease, but it can be informative for those who haven't.

Permalink",False,"Julianne Moore won a long deserved Oscar for her role as a woman suffering from early onset Alzheimer's. This is probably the first movie in which the afflicted person is at the center of the story, and it gets told from her point of view. Most of the credit goes to Moore, who shows Alice slowly losing the ability to remember things, but also to Alec Baldwin as her husband, and Kate Bosworth, Kristen Stewart and Hunter Parrish as her children, all of whom do what they can to support Alice as she needs progressively more help.

I really recommend ""Still Alice"". I can't think of anything bad to say about it. Husband-and-husband directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland also did 2006's ""Quinceañera"", which I also recommend (Glatzer succumbed to ALS earlier this year). A real masterpiece in every way.

Permalink",True,"I will say that Julianne Moore sure gave one of her finest performances as Professor Alice Howland, a Columbia University Linguists professor who discovers that she has the early onset stages of familiar Alzheimer's disease which is a rare form which is rather progressive. When watching the film, it was as though it was watching my own history on the screen since I happen recall a particular circumstance in which someone I knew forget who they were and the ones around them. In many ways I felt for Alice as she was slowly fading away from the smart and resourceful person that she once was, as she loses her memory and her way of life. Julianne manages to portray the confusion, anger, loss, and sadness that Alice feels and seeing how her husband and children react to the news and dealing with it in their own ways. The film sure is rather emotional as it does an excellent job portraying how one deals with the loss of their memories and something worth seeing.

Permalink",True,"Since seeing the Oscar buzz surrounding this movie I have been anxious to get my hands on the DVD. I did last night, from my public library. It is not just a worthwhile story but it also serves to call attention to the plight, more research is needed to find a cure.

Julianne Moore (won Best Actress) is in the lead role as linguistics professor Alice Howland. She is only 50 but people around her notice that she seems to forget things too often. She sees a Neurologist and the ultimate diagnosis is early onset of Alzheimer's.

That is what this movie is about, the fact that it can begin at a relatively young age and family and friends don't know what to do about it.

Kate Bosworth is her older daughter, Anna, and Kristen Stewart is her younger daughter Lydia. Even though Anna is the most level- headed, it is Lydia who in the end sticks with mom and does the difficult job required in late stages of the disease.

Not a nice subject but it is well made and Moore is quite good in the role.

Permalink",False,"Well, Still Alice finally came out on DVD/Blu-Ray so I was able to sit down and watch the Oscar winner long past due. Julianne Moore stars as a college professor who gets diagnosed with a rare form of Alzheimer's at the early age of 50. The film shows the struggle that her and her family go through as she deals with her deteriorating memory. As depressing as it is to sit through a full movie with conditions like that, the film manages to be pretty inspiring as well, while also being extremely well acted.

We know right off the bat that the heart of the story lies with Alice's relationship with one of her daughters, Lydia, played by Kristen Stewart. Stewart has been a hated actress since her days as Bella Thorne, but I think she thrives here. The role didn't call for a wide range of acting, and she really played the subtle emotional moments well. The rest of the family was also well put together. Alec Baldwin, Kate Bosworth, Tom Howland all show the great lengths that each family member is put through during a rough time like this. Everyone knows someone with Alzheimer's or at least an issue similar to that so it was nice to see a film depict it in a realistic and accurate way.

I also thought the way they showed the various stages of her disease was heartbreaking. The important thing that was stressed throughout was to never give up hope. The speech by Alice 3/4 of the way through gave us a sense of the impact that a story like hers can have on other people. She took her skills in linguistics to create an emotionally powerful and motivating speech to people who are also dealing with Alzheimer's. When she flubs words or messes up a situation, I found myself feeling uncomfortable for her. It's a tribute to how much you grow to care about Alice, again a compliment to Moore's career defining performance.

The flashbacks that are shown throughout don't do a whole lot to further the story and give an unneeded break from the dramatic tension in present time. But the simple piano score was a perfect accomplice to the depressing but also hopeful tone. I thought it really balanced the tough times and bonding that a family can go through. With that said, the actual ending just kind of happens. I understand that it's very difficult to end a story like this, but I felt like there was more closure needed. But I did love the fact that the title Still Alice is shown throughout the entire credits.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice is most certainly one of the most difficult movies I've watched in recent times. Not because I've had people close to me suffer from this terrible disease, but because overall, this family story, which could be relatable to others, really pulled me in and had me in shreds after all was said and done. Julianne Moore truly shines in this role, as she immerses us in her unfortunate situation. To watch a person go from incredibly smart and confident to confused and lonely is not only heartbreaking, but it also gives you a sense of hopelessness. But as Alice herself tells us in a speech during the film, we must not forget that the person we know and love is still there and that the happy moments do count for something. Finishing up, I found this movie to be an incredible experience, truly respectable of people who suffer from Alzheimer's. Talking movie terms, it's the incredible performance from Julianne Moore that is, front and center, the movie in all its brilliance, whilst also featuring some very good performances, from the secondary cast, to support it.

""Still Alice"" (2014) is not a tear jerker, but it will definitely move you. This is a very well made picture - not overwritten, not overacted and not an inspirational star driven movie - it strikes just the right notes and creates realistic yet very warm and intimate portrait of woman's struggles with Alzheimer. The central performance by a great J.Moore is a tour de force powerhouse acting - Oscar was absolutely deserved award. The story isn't really important in this movie - it's all about the present moments in the face of inevitability.

Overall, ""Still Alice"" is a very warm, quite and moving picture. It shows us the disease as well as people who are affected by it. Directing, music are perfectly balanced and the performances are uniformly good, with one standout and exceptional. It's not an inspirational movie, but at the end nevertheless it's somehow manages to create bright and hopeful feeling instead of despair.

Permalink",False,"The awareness of the tragedy of Alzheimer's disease grows each year, and the older we grow the more poignant this poorly understood malady becomes. This radiantly beautiful film STILL ALICE helps – it helps to fill in some of the clinical data, testing, rigors of diagnosing, and inadequacy of available 'treatment': it also helps the audience witness how this disease not only encumbers the people around the victims who must alter their lifestyle to accommodate the increasing dependency on caregivers; but most important, it offers the view of the person with this progressive disease and the way the little things about living slip away insidiously.

Directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Washington adapted Lisa Genova's novel of the same name with tremendous sensitivity, sifting through Genova's copious medical data and taking just the right amount to make us understand what little is known about Alzheimer's without belaboring the technical aspects, leaving room for the actors to offer us the effects of the diagnosis rather than a docudrama of a disease.

One fine plot synopsis tells enough: 'Alice Howland is a renowned linguistics professor happily married with three grown children. All that begins to change when she strangely starts to forget words and then more. When her doctor diagnoses her with Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease, Alice and her family's lives face a harrowing challenge as this terminal degenerative neurological ailment slowly progresses to an inevitable conclusion they all dread. Along the way, Alice struggles to not only to fight the inner decay, but to make the most of her remaining time to find the love and peace to make simply living worthwhile.'

But it is the blazingly real performance by Julianne Moore that crowns this achievement. The supporting cast truly supports – Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Stephen Kunken, Hunter Parrish, Kate Bosworth, Quincy Tyler Bernstine especially. Profoundly moving, this is an important film on so many levels that it belongs in the DVD libraries of everyone who cares about variations of living and the circle of life. Highly Recommended.

Permalink",False,"Some may dismiss 'Still Alice' as Oscar bait. The subject matter of Alzheimer's disease, a leading woman role and released before the Academy Awards probably made you think this. I was one of those people. I have never been more wrong in my whole life.

Alice Howland is the definition of outgoing. She takes pride in her work at the local University, loves her friends and family and regularly goes for runs around the University Campus. So when she does develop Alzheimer's disease it affects her and her family very dramatically. Julianne Moore truly deserves the Oscar she won for this film. It is unbelievable how her character changes throughout the course of the film. Even with a 12a certificate the film holds no punches. Diving into the deep end and showing that the disease is no small matter. Moore should and I am sure will be remembered throughout cinematic history. If she is not, then at least I will.

Thankfully she is not the only one that does herself proud. Even if the other roles are not Oscar worthy, they are at least memorable and you cannot give higher praise than that. Kate Bosworth as her daughter Anna likewise impresses when she takes a toll for the worse, once it is revealed that she too has the Alzheimer's gene. Alec Baldwin as her husband John is understanding and caring in equal amounts and supportive of his wife. He knows that his family will never be the same again. You can almost see the look of sorrow in his eyes. Surprise, surprise, Kristen Stewart as Lydia their second daughter is not worthless in this film; I cannot express how happy I am about this. I was anxious that she would bring the entire film crashing down upon itself. If anything she lends the film a different angle, a teenager's perspective. Lydia refuses to be checked for the Alzheimer's gene; not that she does not care, just that she would rather not know until it is essential.

The thing that 'Still Alice' gets chiefly right is thankfully the handling of the disease itself. We are never bombarded with sentimentality, loss and fear. It all comes naturally, never too much or too little. It is almost as if the film is an in depth study into the disease. The most impactful scenes are the ones where Alice starts to lose control of her body and mind; little by little, day by day. She ends up lost on campus after a run and it is fast approaching night when she returns home; or when she repeats her thoughts and feelings at a family gathering; or even not being able to do the simple things that we take for granted in our life. Such as going to the bathroom, she realises she does not even know where it is anymore.

The script should also be given much credit for finding the right balance between hope and despair. Particularly in the speeches that Alice gives to a room full of people. 'Still Alice' is constantly dramatic but never overpowering or too much to handle, with the exception of the low key final scene. You do not need me to tell you that none of this is going to end well. If it did then I suppose it would render the entire film itself redundant.

The Director understands that there is only so much that an audience can take before they walk out of the cinema, which is why 'Still Alice' is little over ninety minutes, not that I could take much more of this masterpiece, I began to break down in the final scene and credits. Take this comment to mean that this film is essential viewing for anyone over the age of fifteen. Anyone of a younger age will find it all too much to handle, so proceed with caution as this film is far more affecting on an emotional level.

'Still Alice' is proof that films about diseases do not have to be dreary and dire or full of hope. Yet, 'Still Alice' is not for the faint of heart. But, if you crave dramatic, emotionally complex and Oscar worthy acting and directing, then 'Still Alice' is for sure a milestone in not just powerful, gripping and moving dramas, but cinema as a whole."

Permalink",False,"""Still Alice"" is based on a novel concerning the mental illness of a linguistics professor who suffers early Alzheimer,' and the bonding of the family is at stakes due to the illness that aggravates with time. The film just beautifully delineates the dreadfulness of the disease, and the courage with which the family endures the disease and supports the sufferer sets an inspiration. The greatest virtue of this drama is it develops effortlessly layer after layer and stands for the strength the family can bring in such devastating illness which is represented through the support the protagonist gets from her caring husband and children and in a way, shows parenthood and sibling rivalry.

The theme of the movie just superbly comes through the brilliant script and memorable characters. The superbly narrated dialogues just grip you to the last of the movie, and the wonderful performances just leave you speechless. Amid a very simply told story, the film remains totally gripping following an Oscar winning performance from Julianne Moore and equally nice performances from Alec Baldwin (less known for such family dramas) and Kristen Dunst. Perhaps it remains one of the sublime family dramas of the year along ""Boyhood"".

Permalink",True,"Julianne Moore truly excels in this harrowing tale of loss of self. The topic ""Alzheimer's Disease"" was never going to make this a comfortable watch and it was self evident how it would end, the only question then for the viewer was how intelligent and sensitive the treatment might be and would there be any Hollywood melodrama. The film inserts an element of melodrama in a very clever way then sensibly pulls back.Otherwise this is a very worthy drama but a somewhat dry watch, that though i recognised many elements from a family experience that did ring very true the inter family inter couple scenes largely did not, perhaps because the film really needed another hour to avoid feeling like you were watching a piece of cinematic shorthand.I have long become bored by actor's winning Oscar's for portraying handicaps, illnesses and disabilities (IE.Eddie Redmayne)however Julianne Moore is as remarkable as it is possible to be in a performance and more than deserves her Oscar success, her work is brilliant.However as i close i will mention a grip at Hollywood movies, once again our subject is a very remarkable super successful super wealthy individual, are there no ordinary people in America.But,overall this is a top American film for 2015.

Permalink",False,"""Still Alice"" is, in my opinion, the best of all the films that were in any way in the running for the 2015 Oscars. Making drama that is touching without resorting to effective but cheap movie tropes is not easy. It requires a strong cast, a well-written script and a director with a steady hand, all things this film has. Moore's performance is subtle but convincing: as the disease eats at her character and she begins to recede into herself, Moore has fewer and fewer means of getting the emotional weight of the story across, yet her acting only becomes stronger throughout the film. Alec Baldwin is solid as the dependable husband who is torn between his ambitions in research and caring for his wife, giving one of his rare 'serious' performances. The language used in the script is simply beautiful. Of course, this is to be expected from a film about a linguistics professor, but it's a delight nonetheless. The directing naturally focuses on Moore's performance, but doesn't neglect everything else as often happens with films of this type. The scenery at the beach house is beautifully shot, and the decors are tasteful throughout. If there is a complaint to be made about this film, it's that the supporting cast, i.e. the rest of the Howland family minus the youngest daughter played by Kirsten Stewart, is not really given a chance to flesh out their characters. But that's a minor thing. I am glad that a subtle performance, rather than an over-the-top one as so often happens, has won the female actress Oscar this year.

Her gradual decline, intelligently and sensitively portrayed by Moore who is worthy of her Oscar, is gradual but she suffers the greatest blows and though the impact is internal the pain and agony is felt throughout the family and indeed the cinema.

Though it seems at the moment that women in mainstream American cinema only get meaningful lead roles if they are a women in crisis, Julianne Moore embraces the opportunity and the rest of the cast in terms of performance cannot keep up.

Rating: 3.4/5 stars

Elevated by a gripping central performance from Julianne Moore, ""Still Alice"" is a heartfelt drama that honors its delicate themes with bravery and sensitivity. It provides a valuable lesson in empathy and understanding, with a message for all of us in accepting what we've lost, and celebrating what hasn't yet gone.

Dr. Alice Howland, happily married with three grown children, is a renowned linguistics professor who starts to forget words. When she receives a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's Disease, Alice and her family find their bonds profoundly tested. Her struggle to stay connected to who she once was is frightening, heartbreaking, and inspiring all at once.

However, there's a directness to the production that might feel blunt were it not elevated by Moore and Baldwin's heartbreaking duet performance. Indeed, the movie explicitly shows what a terrible thing the mind (especially if it's as brilliant as Alice Howland's) is to watch waste away, and rarely has the horror of losing one's inner self to Alzheimer's been conveyed as precisely and powerfully as it is here. It's just that it could have been more worthwhile and aware than it is.

As for the film, it has two strong performances and enough grace notes to make quite an impression. Julianne Moore isn't merely good in the lead role. She's devastatingly, heartrendingly good, and she's a big reason why ""Still Alice"" is as moving as it is. As films about people with devastating diseases go, ""Still Alice"" is understated, thought-provoking, brilliantly acted, and written and directed with a steady hand.

Permalink",False,"Seeing someone cheerful and active weakening due to progressive illness is never pleasant, at its depiction on screen, its angle is up to director and screenwriter, after all. In my opinion, the creation as a whole is not flawless, as the ending came abruptly and without further answers, but all performances are good (also Alex Baldwin's, although his character was somehow similar to the one in It's Complicated) and Julianne Moore in the role of Alice is wonderful, her Academy Award is deserved (well, she has always been a great actress - with brave selection of roles - and could have earned this statue several times earlier). You really share her feelings, begin to feel sympathy who how copes with the disease beyond control, when you have both ""normal"" moments and ""ill"" moments. As illness like Alzheimer is particularly tragic if you yourself recognize it, not speaking of the family, who can max provide certain relief...

So, 9+ points to Moore, 7- points to the plot/screenplay. There was less profundity and dynamism as in e.g. Misery or The Accused, both awarded with Academy Award for Best Actress as well."

Permalink",False,"This film is highly recommended.

Alice Howland is a successful professor from Columbia University who has it all: loyal husband, three loving children, and a well respected position at the college. She also is diagnosed with the early stages of Alzheimer's at the age of 50. We watch her deterioration from an attractive professional to a slow-functioning recluse and it is riveting drama. We are on this harrowing journey with Alice as we witness the death of a human being while still living.

Written and directed by the team of Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland. Still Alice resonates with passion and clarity. The directors tend to overuse flashbacks of Alice's past to emphasize her before and after dilemma, but they also use many wide-angle shots and out- of-focus viewpoints to stress Alice's beleaguered state most efficiently.

Julianne Moore is masterful in the title role. A tilt of the head, an inquisitive look, a far-off blank state, the verbal loss of words, all these frightening aspects of Alzheimer's are there in her mesmerizing performance. Most effective are her ways to cope with the ravages of this disease: written notes to herself, on paper or on the computer, highlighting lines from her lectures to remain focused, visual clues throughout the house wherever possible. Her lecture to a medical staff and families of Alzheimer's patients is one of the film's most emotional sequences and one of Ms. Moore's finest moments in her illustrious career. She is so well deserving of an Oscar in this great role.

Giving her ample support are a strong ensemble. Alec Baldwin as her flawed but supportive husband, Kate Bosworth as her eldest daughter, Hunter Parrish as her son, and especially Kristin Stewart as her flighty daughter, Lydia, are totally convincing as the family members thrown into Alice's hellish world.

Still Alice becomes all too real and doesn't hold back from showing the ugliness of this disease (except for the film's slightly abrupt ending). The film is chilling in its depiction of a woman trying to come to terms with a illness that will ravish her own being and impact her family from years to come. It is, at times, disturbing viewing and heart-wrenching to witness. But the film needs to be seen, not only as an informative treatise about Alzheimer's, but also as a lasting testament to human strength and endurance.

Permalink",False,"This movie is sad. And I mean like if Titanic was just two and a half hours of people holding each other before they drowned sad. Don't see this if you don't like sad movies.

I went to see this because of all the buzz about Julianne Moore's performance. I'm relieved to say that the buzz is definitely justified. But make no mistake, the film is an acting vehicle for Moore, pure and simple. The film exists purely for Moore's performance, and everything else is in place not for the story, but to support that performance. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. Moore is very subtle and very moving in the role. I don't think anyone else could have played Alice the way Moore did. There is a scene where she watches a video of herself earlier in her diagnosis (which we see filmed) and its remarkable how much she has changed, so gradually, throughout the film.

The film is delicately crafted and well handled, but if the film hadn't been just about Moore's performance it could have been better. For example, subplots about her daughter inheriting the disease or her husband (perfectly cast Alec Baldwin) and his struggle are dumped beyond Alice's reaction to events. The film could really have benefited from those subplots.

Throughout the movie I was waiting for it to reach ""devastating"". If you're going to be a really sad film, you might as well give us everything you've got. At the film's final act, it definitely reaches this point, which was good to see because otherwise I'd have felt it squandered its potential.

Overall, Moore elevates a very sad movie to pretty good status. Without her, the movie would collapse on itself. She will win the Oscar (even though Rosamund Pike was better) and she deserves it after her glorious career.

And whoever cast Kristen Stewart as the youngest daughter who is chasing an unrealistic dream of being an actress needs a cookie."

Permalink",False,"I think that my esteem for Julienne Moore was born when I watched movies like ""Children of men"" or ""Far from Heaven"", and it reinforces thanks to movies like ""The forgotten"", ""Chloe"", ""The kids are all right"", ""What Maise knew"", ""Don Jon"", ""Carrie"" and ""Maps to the star"" in which, no matter the level of the film, Julianne Moore shows all her talent. But the movies that made me love this actress are ""The great Lebowski"" and ""Still Alice"". Yesterday, to the cinema, I felt in love again with Julianne Moore and her charm. She played a strong, fragile women affected by a premature Alzheimer. This kind of movie risk to show a forced portrait, trying to touch the spectators. ""Still Alice"" touch the spectator without pathetic scenes or excessive slush. And this thanks to Julianne Moore that perform in a incisive, truthfully way. This is surely the role of the life for this great actress, I hope not the only one.

Permalink",True,"For anyone that has ever had a loved one, known someone or even read about the devastating invasion of Alzheimer's disease, this movie is universally beautiful.

Julianne Moore is haunting, gentle and so mesmerizing as Alice, the main character plagued with early onset Alzheimer's. She is a mother of three successful and loving children, a wife to a supportive and genuine husband, a scholar and college professor, and a women who you can feel just from her smile loves life and everything it offers.

Watching her initial concerns with her little laps in memory takes your breath away. We can all relate to the panics we get when faced with what could be a small or large medical concern. It is quickly confirmed she has this disease and her life is about to change drastically.

Coming to terms with her disease and telling her husband for the first time, was one of the most powerful points in the movie. She breaks down her strong intellectual being and cries to her husband in a heart wrenching moment so touching.

Watching her mind and body slowly begin to betray her, was painful yet incredibly inspiring. She was gentle and determined to live life and going on making everyday the best she could through every terrifying moment, or any moment of inspiration. The movie was so comforting as painful as the subject as, only because we see a family full of love and support. It was so beautiful to see how loved this women was by all that knew her, and easy to see by the grace she held.

Even when her disease had reached a crucial point in its evolution, Alice decides to speak publicly about her disease, a moment delivered so powerfully and shakes the core to realize how precious life is and how much we learn even through such a overwhelming experience such as this.

When Alice comments on how she would have rather had cancer than Alzheimer's was another core shaking moment as we feel the depths of a disease that affects the mind. With Cancer, or other crippling diseases as devastating as they can be, when you are without the accompaniment of your mind, that is truly a terrifying realization.

Alec Baldwin incorporated a perfect character of a man filled with fear, yet was flawlessly guided by the love of his wife to be strong, solid and compassionate. The scene at the yogurt shop nearing the highest progression of her diseases was so loving and yet peaceful.

A beautiful, thoughtful, and haunting insight to the experience this disease brings to not only the person going through it first hand, but to all people who encounter it in any form.

Permalink",False,"What a horrifying experience for anyone, and Moore gave an frighteningly real portrait of the disease.

It feels like the filmmakers did their research and feels like I got an honest look at a disease with no happy ending.

Julianne Moore plays Dr. Alice Howard, an intelligent woman, and master of languages who learns she suffers from an inherent form of early Alzheimer's. The movie than proceeds to go through the stages as Alice attempts to keep what she's loosing fast.

I get the guise of what it must feel like for a smart person to loose what they feel makes them who they are. She gets pretty desperate and Moore gets us so trapped up in this, that I can't help to feel a personal connection, even though I known no one who has went through this myself.

I love the role new technology plays in the movie as Alice uses her smart phone to attempt to stop the progression of the disease by playing memories games and leaving notes for herself for days that get really, really bad. For me, I felt a feeling of hope that someday technology could help us beat it, but that maybe just me and it was very little (I love my smart phone)

Kristian Stewart gets a bad wrap for her acting chomps. Though I never really seen her in anything, not even the Twilight movies, so I have nothing really to compare it too, she made me believe in her character, Lydia, the artist in a family of scientist coping with what's going on. It was the type of support Moore needed for her performance.

Another great performance was from Alec Baldwin who played Alice's husband, but Alec is one of those type of actors that people like to watch so it was not hard for him. He plays a guy who tries to be strong for his wife, but slowly falls short, but it's hard to be mad at him because of the situation. it seems like a role made perfect for Baldwin.

Based on the book, the movie seems to focus more on Moore's performance, which was excellent, but you get the feeling there may have been things left out from the book to make room for it. Now I definitely have to read the book.

The movie or rather Julianne Moore just hits you with it from beginning to end in this grim drama of real life.

Permalink",True,"In my top ten least favourite actresses, Julianne Moore has been on that list for some time. I don't really know why...I just have never taken to her well. She has had some good films but as an actress she has never impressed me. Well Ms. Moore...consider me a convert, all in one performance. Still Alice might be one of the saddest, most heart wrenching films I have ever seen. Obviously any film that deals with something as terrifying and awful as Alzheimer's is going to be hard to watch but this film does things with the subject that has never been done before. This film not only brings to light just how serious this disease is but I think it also works at giving victims of this their dignity back. The woman in the film struck down is in the prime of her life. She is an intelligent (above average in fact) linguistics expert with a wonderful marriage and children and a future ahead of her and all of that is brought to a halt with the diagnosis. I'm not sure I've ever seen a film that so accurately and horribly shows us the toll the disease takes and the fast degeneration of her mental state. This is a far cry from entertainment, its literally hard to watch and yet an absolute must see all at once.

Julianne Moore gives the performance of her career period. This character gets so much depth and so quickly and she makes you connect with this woman immediately. Its very important that we feel so connected to her and understand her and who she has been so that we can truly feel the emotional turmoil of her disease and you do. As far as I'm concerned her Oscar win should be a lock. Alec Baldwin plays her devoted husband. His character doesn't get as much focus but he shouldn't either. At the same time we get to see how this effects him too and most importantly how it feels when others lives move on as yours stops. Their chemistry is quite good and works very well. Kate Bosworth (looking very sickly), Shane McRae, Hunter Parrish and Kristen Stewart play their children. (McRae is their son-in-law.) McRae, Bosworth and Parrish are all decent in their parts but they don't stand out at all. There isn't a lot of story left to devote to them and they are there for a purpose but it isn't a focus. Stewart is terrible. Now I'm not one to crap on an actor because its fashionable to do so. Everyone loves to make fun of Stewart. I'm willing to give her a chance but her casting in this film was a terrible mistake. I get she is supposed to be the free-spirited artistic wild child and sadly the story gives her the most focus out of the children but she just seems bored and she does that whole brooding vampire thing that should die with Twilight. She doesn't fit in and her chemistry with Moore just isn't right. Its unfortunate but she really does drag the cast down. The children as a whole are almost unnecessary if not for the fact that we need to know Moore is a mother and looking forward to Grandchildren.

Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland co-direct and co-wrote the screenplay for the film. They have truly done something remarkable here. They have created the story of Alice and they make us adore her and then they make us experience her loss in the most depressing way possible. I would watch this film again to experience how magnificently they have made this but each and every time it would be gut wrenching to watch. It is perhaps one of the saddest films I have ever seen. I think as human beings this is something each and every one of us fear and to watch it in such a way that is stripped of any pretences or Hollywood dramatics. Its beautiful. Please see this but understand if you are sensitive to the top of Alzheimer's this will really touch you. 9/10

Permalink",False,"For me there are two remarkable aspects of Still Alice...the Bravura performance of Julianne Moore, who proves once again she's right up there with Meryl Streep. And second, how a lovely film such as this can have a lower rating on this site than The Interview. There's something wrong here.

Moore portrays a middle aged educator who develops early onset Alzheimer's and she makes a believer out of you. She plays the role as accurately as any actor could. If there is one criticism I would say it is the speed at which the condition develops. The film tends to be more in real time than time lapse.

Other than Moore, Kristin Stewart, as one of her daughters, turns in a super supporting role culminating in the telling final scene...an honest and sensitive performance,

Permalink",True,"STILL ALICE (2014) ***1/2 Julianne Moore, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth, Alec Baldwin, Hunter Parrish, Stephen Kunken. Moore gives an Oscar worthy performance as a gifted linguistics professor who suddenly begins showing signs of memory loss which inevitably is diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease which thrusts her into a journey of self-preservation and attempt to retain as much of herself, and memory, as possible. Based on the novel by Lisa Genova and skillfully adapted by filmmakers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland the film's strengths rely upon a remarkable star performance by Moore whose intelligent, nuanced turn is a slowly progressive study in heartbreak and healing all at once; a miracle of itself. Low-key performances by Baldwin as her equally counterbalanced husband who has more difficult in the shattering news to the fold than his better half and especially Stewart as their youngest daughter, an actress in transition herself. Modulated with keen observation to the paralyzing fear, frustration and eventual devastation of a truly heinous disease that robs its victims of their identities and memory it is equally poignant in the reality that Glatzer suffers from ALS and cannot talk anymore speaks volumes to the delicate yet sharply keen observations on what the human spirit truly is all about.

Permalink",True,"Alice Howland is a linguistics professor at Columbia, happily married to John with three children; Anna, Tom and Lydia. Soon after her fortieth birthday she begins experiencing memory loss symptoms, forgetting words of difficult concepts. Alice sees a neurologist and gets MRI and blood checks which come back fine. But her subsequent CAT scan confirms the hypothesis of Alzheimer disease. In her case it's the rare familial version that occurs at an earlier age, can get passed on to her offspring, and gets even worse to those with high level of education due to the increased brain activity. Alice and John tell their children about her illness. Anna and Tom get their selves tested for the passed on genes, while Lydia refuses to do so. Anna result comes back a positive while Tom's comes back negative.

Meanwhile, her children are also dealing with their own problems. Anna and her husband decides to go to a fertility clinic to encourage pregnancy, Tom still going on a new relationship with a new girl after breaking up, and Lydia is still the rebellious last child who refuse to go to college to pursue her acting career. Alice's illness progress at a saddening rate. She soon uses her phone to list things and uses the phone's alarm linked to a list of questions to refresh herself on the most crucial memories such as the names of her children and her own address. While she is still able, she makes a video intended for herself dictating step by step on how to commit suicide by drug overdose. She soon lose her capability to teach, forgetting the class schedule, appointments, and routes. She even wet herself because she can't find where the toilet is.

Once she's invited to speak at an Alzheimer convention, where not only her words, but the way she reads them shows her struggle against the memory loss. The family is affected deeply by Alice. They try to connect with Alice amidst all their businesses. John even has to postpone a job offer from the Mayo Clinic. The illness get even worse on Alice that she forgets even her children's name. Soon Alice gets to see the birth of her grandchildren, Anna's twin babies. But Alice gets even worse tat John has to help her to get dressed. Soon, failed with her producer connection, Lydia returns to live with her parents as Alice loses the ability to utter words.

The movie is really worthy to be dubbed as one of this year's saddest and most touching movie. There are still moments of happiness in this movie. But all of them leads to sad moments. Some of those sad moments even occur so suddenly amidst the happy moments, creating some subtle but significant shocks to the viewers. For me the movie is one of the most successful in giving me some shivers at its touching moments. I consider myself to be quite rarely touched by movie depictions, but this movie succeeded in making me rethink about the possibility of such an illness happening to me or to someone I love.

One thing that should also be noted is that even though the movie depicts such a sad family drama, the producers were great to not depend the sadness emphasis on crying depiction, including as little crying scenes as possible. Fortunately the producers confine this movie into a duration below one hundred minutes. This helps limit the effect that it can have on our feelings considering Alice's ill condition gets worse and worse by matter of months, or mere minutes in the movie's run time. This makes the movie able to creep in the depressing feeling slow but steadily into the viewers' minds on seeing Alice's condition.

The acting overall is a good job. Julianne Moore did a very good job in depicting the illness' symptoms and in striking progression. Alec Baldwin did good in portraying the husband who's in denial at first but later on able to stand by his ailing wife. Kristen Stewart did okay in playing her character who is still rebellious even though her mother is known to be ill. Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish did okay in playing complimentary roles for this movie.

Still Alice (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score for me. A recommendation goes out for you who are willing to spend money to feel sad at the cinemas. It is indeed a very touching movie about an illness and family relationship.

Permalink",False,"I didn't expect such an awkwardly paced, messy film. It doesn't even come close to being in the same level as Away From Her/Amour. I'm not a fan of serious films just basically existing to be vehicles for their leads, and really just existing for that purpose. That's how this feels. Moore is just great. She's a great actress and manages to create a real person and character with different shades out of, not much. The film, for all its faults, was always pretty engrossing, really because of its acting. Not sure how well Moore will hold up by the year's end line-ups, but what's surprising is that, unlike another highly-acclaimed actress like Cate Blanchett last year, More here doesn't have the same theatrics to play with and she certainly doesn't have many big scenes. Definitely doesn't feel like an Oscar-winning performance, no matter how great it is.

As for Kristen Stewart, she's very good. Certainly admirable work, but worth of an Oscar nomination? Naahhhh

Permalink",False,"Again, Julianne Moore did a great job to portray a career-minded ambitious woman who suffered the fatal gene inherited from her father, a disease that nothing can be done to stop or cure the dementia, the nickname of the Alzheimer's disease. She got that, then one of her daughter got it past down from her. This year, we got two movies in the same genre, the other one; an also a very good one, ""You Are Not You"". Both focused on an unlucky, highly educated, very successful woman who suddenly encountered a fatal disease.

This great film has some weak and/or flawed characters development and wrong casting job. Alec Baldwin is the one that definitely a miscast. The role he played got no chemistry with his wife and their children. The role he played to those three children only gave an impression of a step father, a guy who had divorced his first wife then married Alice with three children. A.B. used to be a great actor, but he was jammed into this role with no enthusiasm at all. He treated his wife and those three grown-up children with no love or passion, a total outsider and stranger in the house. The screenplay also suffered a very unbalanced ration to the three children, the son, suffered the similar vague character development as what the father character weak characterization, another stranger in the family. I strongly believed that the screenplay focused on the daughter played by Kristen Stewart was a very unbalanced choice. If the scenarios could become a bit more devastating, it should focus on the daughter who was diagnosed with the same fatal disease, who was also pregnant, expecting another future candidate of that god-awful disease. Then again, the daughter's husband seemed to be not suffered any anxiety and stress when he found out that his wife got it too and their future offspring was doomed.

What troubled me most and made this movie not as good as it should be, was the unbalanced and not-so-smart characters allocations, the absolutely no-chemistry flaws between the couple, the father-children, and among the 3 children, and the son to his parents and vice versa. It seems to me, this family is full of strangers, parents to their kids and kids to their parents. All the family members, except the mother character, only did lip services to each other and among themselves. The family tie simply was not so strong, a family full of strangers.

But in general, Julianne Moore has again and again proved herself an actor with the ultimate acting talent. She could do any role in any film that required her to be a leading role with 110% convincing focus and endeavor, making her worth every penny that she earned. She is inevitably an overly familiar face on the screen since she played and appeared in so many films, but the audiences could accept her as a new face in the new or old films she involved, because she always transformed herself into that specific role. An actor who should have at least won 2 or 3 or even 4 Best Actress in Drama of the Oscar, but never got it so far; a shame to all of the pathetic Oscar voting members!!!"

Permalink",False,"BY RYAN C. SHOWERS

""Still Alice"" is a gem of a movie. It's a film that does not set its goals to an extraordinary scale but one that achieves every syllable in its mission statement.

Perhaps ""Still Alice"" was never intended to be produced by a big studio, and the film embraces its independently made nature. Shot with clear photography and a cloudless vision, the unadorned visual style meets the substance in the film's acting talents and story to result in an engrossing film of class and poise. Its simplicity is one of the elements that gives it a sophisticated edge over other films this year.

The film rests on the shoulders of its main character, Dr. Alice Howland, therefore, the success of ""Still Alice"" is dependently reliant on Julianne Moore's portrayal. She's been an immutable force this year. First as flying with Liam Neeson to box office cash with ""Nonstop"", followed by a Cannes Best Actress win for a pummeling, zestful turn ""Maps to the Stars"", and then contributing her acting talents to the latest chapter in the culture phenomenon ""The Hunger Games"" series, now Moore rounds 2014 off with a devastating, authentic performance as a middle-aged woman diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease.

Moore's best performance was as a version of Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway in ""The Hours"" playing Laura Brown. While ""Still Alice"" does not quite bulldoze that sublime piece of drama, it is reminiscent of her acting style, in that Moore allows her eyes to do the talking. The great pleasure of watching ""Still Alice"" is observing Moore seize the material and watching her distinctively choose how to play each scene. The gravity of Moore's work hits you most in the final scenes, not because they contain uncontrollable, hysterical acting, but because the evolution of the character's deterioration crystallizes.

Near the conclusion of the picture deep into her condition, Alice watches a video that we, the audience, watched her record when the first signs of the disease were detected. It is this scene that reveals how intelligent and effective ""Still Alice"" is: We do not notice how drastically the character has declined since the start of the film until this point. This scene also showcases one of Moore's best moments in the film.

Adapted from a novel by Lisa Genova, the script of ""Still Alice"" is clean, cut, and articulate. The downward spiral experience of the protagonist is fully conceived within the screenplay. It describes and shows us the tragedy of Alzheimer's disease from the point of view of a patient and their family. In addition to examining the impacts of its medical subjects, the screenplay written by directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland scrapes into family ties, contains incisive symbolism, and echoes well composed dialogue. The script is a stepping stone for Moore and the other actors, all of who satisfy their place in the picture fittingly, to design characters who at their darkest moments are realistically refined and humane.

""Still Alice"" is a lovely, petite, very adult independent film with a sterling leading performance from veteran actress Julianne Moore.

Permalink",False,"""Still Alice"" should be devastating. It's about a subject that needs no embellishment to be emotionally effective and it stars someone (Julianne Moore) who's given some of the best screen performances in recent times. So then why isn't it more moving?

I think it might have to do with the fact that the film takes place in a vacuum for the viewer. We don't know much about Alice before she becomes ill, beyond some superficial facts about her successful career. We're introduced to her family briefly before the tension that develops from having an ill mother settles in, and they're not especially likable or relatable. Alec Baldwin isn't a good enough actor to make his doctor husband believable. Kristen Stewart is her usual drippy, mumbly self as Moore's youngest daughter and the only one who's willing to help in any kind of meaningful way. Julianne Moore, on the other hand, is a wonderful actress, but she's not given a whole lot to do other than mimic the more physical and literal struggles of someone struggling with Alzheimer's. Her inner turmoil, which is what would have made this movie more emotionally involving and interesting, remains a mystery.

I don't begrudge Moore her Oscar win for this movie, because she was long overdue for the award. But it's unfortunately yet another case of an actress winning an Academy Award for a movie far below her talents.

Permalink",False,"What can be said about this film that hasn't already been said? Oscar winner, career-high performance, moving, real and gritty - it's all been said.

I fell in love with the book first, and when the movie came out, I was eager to watch it. I was not disappointed.

Julianne Moore gives a tour-de-force turn as Alice Howland, a highly successful professor who is diagnosed with early-onset-Alzheimer's disease. Her performance is on point, with every little vocal inflection and facial twitch telling a part of the story. The real shocker here is Kristen Stewart, whom, apart from her god-awful ""Acting-within-acting"" scene, truly moved me. This is the one role I felt as though I could connect with her character. Alec Baldwin plays the disgruntled, unhinged, if slightly apathetic at times, husband, and he does a good job of playing the man who is struggling with balancing his life while trying to care about his wife's life.

The music is perfect, sometimes soft and beautiful, and sometimes loud and frenetic, exactly when and where it needs to be.

The cinematography is nothing to write home about. It's not bad, but it's not stellar, either. The direction feels authentic, if a bit sterilized at times. Also, sometimes scenes cut and you're left to wonder what exactly is going on for about a minute.

What kept me from writing this review for so long was the ending. I was very upset with the ending upon first viewing. But after seeing it a second time, I understand.

(""Spoilers"" up ahead - they don't reveal any key plot points, but I suppose they could be considered spoilers)

The movie ends abruptly, and it's not exactly a ""satisfying"" ending. But the whole point of the movie cannot be nulled. Alice has Alzheimer's. Eventually, she will die. She will lose who she is, and has seemingly almost lost it at the end. There's not a way you can end a movie like that satisfyingly. The movie ends the way it does to push that feeling of dissatisfaction, as if we ourselves have lost it.

The movie is brilliantly executed, and aside from some sanitation and Alec Baldwin's less-than-stellar acting choices, it's fantastic.

Permalink",False,"This was a difficult film for me to rate. I thought it was good to very good and the actors were superb – especially Julianne Moore and Alec Baldwin . However, my doctorate is in cognitive biases and I think I'm too close to the subject matter to be objective. My research is in trying to try to help seniors – with and without dementia, and Alzheimer's is a form a dementia – make the best decisions they can. With dementia there are things you can do to help those afflicted make better decisions. Another point is if you are under age 70 your odds of having any type of dementia are very low, and the odds don't noticeably increase until your mid 80s. After watching this film, relax, the strong odds are you are fine.

My problem is my mother suffered from dementia and lost herself over a period of years. This film brought back a lot of memories. Because of her I take semi-annual tests of my cognitive state and also have a supply of pills set aside. When film intersects life, I tend to lose objectivity.

Permalink",False,"I have read the book before, and I'm glad it got turned into a film because the book was very good. The film does miss out quite a lot but it captures the main events and the essence of the story.

Julianne Moore gives a fantastic performance in this and her portrayal is absolutely on point. I personally do not have any experience with people who have some sort of dementia, but by watching her performance I feel like I have. Moore does the character justice and I feel like this movie has done a great job at raising awareness for the disease. Kate Bosworth plays the daughter well and her bickering with Kristen Stewart's character was well done. Stewart herself gives an all right performance, and so does Hunter Parrish and Alec Baldwin.

The cinematography in this is very attractive, from the run through the trees, the walk on the path to her in the doctor's office- which was filmed interview style. I was wondering why they wouldn't show the doctor, but the effect it had of something formal and clinical, was a nice touch.

I liked how we as the audience can see the gradual and then sudden decline of Alice's mental health, but I think they could have showed us more of how her life and those around her were affected by it. We don't see if she actually gets fired or is told to stop teaching, nor do we see a lot of the husband and children in the house. However, that scene when she watches a certain video was especially compelling.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice is a moving examination of one woman's deterioration from early onset Alzheimer's and its effects on her family. It traces the early stages of her disease to the point where her personality begins to vanish. The film benefits from an excellent performance by Julianne Moore as well as a solid supporting cast. It succeeds in being moving while avoiding sentimentality.

The highlight of the film is Moore's performance, which captures the emotional devastation wrought by the disease without succumbing to histrionics. Moore uses subtle cues to convey Alzheimer's slow breakdown of her character's personality. Although it is unquestionably Moore's show, Alec Baldwin does well as her husband, steering a careful path between self-sacrificing saint and self-absorbed cad. Kristen Stewart and Kate Bosworth also do well in their smaller roles.

Still Alice also benefits from good camera work which conveys the character's condition. At several points in the film, the scenery around Moore blurs, leaving only her in focus. This camera trick gets her sense of confusion and dislocation across to a degree acting could not. The film also benefits from a non-judgmental tone, avoiding treating characters as either martyrs or villains.

The film has some flaws. Most of the characters other than Moore's are drawn in very broad strokes. There is also one unnecessary scene which was obviously intended to promote the Alzheimer's Foundation, a point that could have been gotten across much more subtly. Still, it's worth seeing just for Moore's performance."

Permalink",True,"Rather surprisingly I found out this little film is opened in Cairo this weekend, just after Moore's Oscar triumph, as happiness often befalls unexpectedly, one year ago, I would never imagine this could happen to my favorite actress, at an age considered as the dead- end for most actress, she manages to pull off a such a landslide victory for late bloomers, more unbelievable is that it is from such a low-key director-team Glatzer and Westmoreland, whose previous Errol Flynn biopic THE LAST OF ROBIN HOOD (2013) is a total fiasco.

Life is always unfair, in BIRDMAN (2014, 8/10), the has-been actor Riggan Thomson motives himself with a hip mantra ""sixty is the new thirty"", but not for for Dr. Alice Howland (Moore), a linguistic professor at Columbia University, who has just passed her 50-year-old birthday, her life will slump into the worst scenario due to the early onset Alzheimer's disease. Her previous perfect life, with a loving husband John (Baldwin), three grown-up children with the forthcoming twins from her eldest daughter Anna (Bosworth), plus a plum profession, will all be predestined to plunge into a void.

Glatzer and Westmoreland (real life partners and the former is diagnosed with ALS) brings about a honest and almost raw take on the disease's infliction almost inclusively from Alice's perspective, and no over-hyped theatrical troupe with intense altercation and dramatic disruption from her family, even in the heightened moment when Alice informs her children, her rare case in hereditary through her genes, everything plays out realistically without any intention to implant certain plot machination to point out the ramifications aside from Alice's own deterioration, Moore is riveting in all respects, permeates the kitchen-sink story with her precisely lifelike interpretation of a woman succumbs to oblivion, sternly underscores her powerlessness to even hold the command of her own life when her laborious suicidal attempt could be so easily spoiled, the film hits the right spot for those who has personal contacts with patients of Alzheimer disease. The comparison between Moore and other two recent similar Oscar-nominated performances Julie Christie in AWAY FROM HER (2006, 8/10) and Emmanuelle Riva in AMOUR (2012, 8/10) seems to be unavoidable for debate, but the latter two roles are intricately written for dramatisation (one involuntarily erases the memory of her loyal husband and the other is heightened by her physical immobilisation due to the old age) where the POVs are both reflected from the husbands, here, one must give credits to the counter-sensation decision for the filmmakers, which allows a more objective (even a bit too conventional) angle to witness how the demolition is effectuated.

The supporting cast has never been offered enough material to give play to their talent, maybe most of them consider it more as a privileged opportunity to work with Ms. Moore or a favour to the director duo than a flashy role up for grabbing. The film materialises itself as an ordinary-looking production comes closer to a Lifetime TV flick texture, also the accompanying score is too lugubrious and recycled which purposefully serves for a second-rate sob-fest.

It is awfully difficult for me to write my review objectively, obviously because of my personal affinity to Moore, and without her, the film barely can be valued in any aspects of ""best"" criterion, but it is an important film to convey its central message and subject-matter, to arouse awareness and spark off attention for those patients and their families, and hope something positive will consequently ensue. Finally, as thrilled as I am for Moore's coronation, I will be deceive myself to deny there is a faint whiff of dissatisfied feeling afterward, simply because we know how excellent Moore is in her other unconventionally daring and provocatively juicy roles, but in the end, it is this unassuming ""ugly duckling"" one wins her the top prize, I think only the die-hard Moore-devout can go through my ambivalent thoughts. Also it is always unwise to get the predated title such as ""an Oscar winning performance"" seated before watching the film as it often ruins the original gusto.

Permalink",False,"Having being the granddaughter of an Alzheimers sufferer for 3 years. Living with and taking care of her and seeing her deterioration every step of the way I found myself relating to the movie in more ways than I imagined I would. The realization that Alzheimers disease takes a lot of common attributes in all its patients hit me as I watched the movie. Characteristics such as forgetting where you are. Where the bathroom is.. feeling trapped. Not knowing who your family is .. your family not knowing who you are and who you have become. It was an adventure I relived as I watched the movie. I cried. I related. I empathized. I have so much respect for the families who choose to care for a member with Alzheimers at home and not send him/her away to a medical institution. It takes so much strength. We took the home care route with my grandmother till she was in diapers. Till we were strangers to her. Till the voices in her head stopped. Till she took her last breath. Till we ourselves, took a breath of relief that the pain was over. For her and for us. I will tell you, it's not easy. To bare burden over the life of someone who is 6 times your age, but acts like they are your new born baby.

About the movie I would have wished to see the latter stages of her condition. Where she starts calling her children and husband the names of various house hold objects. How she escapes her home and is found by neighbors and won't come back because she has her own wedding to attend. (Yes, these occurrences of many, happened with us)

Julianne Moore's performance is beyond impeccable and well-deserving of best actress academy award. And the real life award should go to Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin, and Kate bosworth for enveloping the reality in which families of Alzheimers sufferers face on a daily basis.

The movie rates highly on my watch-list because it reflects a part of my life that is sensitive to me. And it is something that needs more public awareness. Mental disease is not an object of ridicule. No matter how young or old you are. Your mind will always be your biggest enemy. And the more aware you are of this, the more control you have to fight it."

I must say that too Julianne Moore(one of the best actresses around) is beautiful and just fantastic in this lead role of a professional woman with early memory loss. Moore is Alice Howland a linguistics professor who has it all success, job tenure, and a loving family as she's married to John(Alec Baldwin)a loving and caring husband and Alice has three grown children and she's about to be a grandmother, only the world starts to change when she starts to forget words. Soon a devastating loss is discovered slowly, but surely a bright and humble mind is set out to sea to sink and this really test all of the family bonds especially with youngest daughter the want to be movie star the go against the grain daughter Lydia(Kristen Stewart). Overall this picture is emotional as you feel the pain and loss with Alice you feel for her as you see that love and support is needed as the memory fades. It just proves the memory is to be loved as it's bright as it begins to fade away with loss the sorrow and pain is felt, overall a touching and emotional film that anyone should see."

Permalink",False,"Not exactly your Friday night feel-good movie.. In fact it's quite the opposite. The brevity of life experiences, the permanence of struggle and suffering, and many more things begin to dawn on you towards the end of the film. A beautiful depiction of one of the toughest diagnoses a working, functioning, independent adult could receive. And possibly the hardest thing a family could hear about a loved one. Not only because of what the disease could do to the affected person, but also the great deal of responsibility and emotional load it imposes on the caretakers.

Beautiful cinematography and camera work serve as the icing on the cake. Julianne Moore is indubitably one of the best in the film business today.. She really proved(in this movie particularly) that there are no roles left out there she can't reach for.. When I read the names of the actresses who read the script and turned this movie down, I was appalled how so many of the greats didn't pick it up(Julia Roberts,Diane Lane,Nicole Kidman).. So curious to see what Diane Lane would've done with this role..

Back to Julianne though, she really brings out both the clueless-ness and the awareness of memory impairment . Both hope and dejection. As the movie progresses, we realize her utmost fear is not only becoming too much of a burden on her loved ones, but more importantly losing the memories that she feels are the essence of who she is.

I cried through at least 70% of the movie, and I honestly think that bit was all Julianne.

Well deserved award nominations Ms. Moore!

The movie's an overall B+ for me!"

Permalink",True,"I loved this film because of the acting performances within it. The film is built entirely around the performances and it still works. Julianne Moore is nothing short of brilliant in her portrayal of Dr. Alice Howland's early onset Alzheimer's Disease. It's an excellent performance to study subtle acting instead of over the top.

The supporting cast of the film: Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth, and Hunter Parrish are excellent as well with Stewart being the standout. Moore's Alice and Stewart's character of Lydia are completely believable as mother and daughter and their relationship makes the film much better.

Also, a shout out to the use of Angels in America.

Permalink",True,"This is a balanced, detailed, touching, realistic, multi faceted movie about a brilliant 50 year old college professor of linguistics suffering from early onset Alzheimer's. The viewer is shown from the stages early forgetfulness, to the diagnosis and then the family reaction, and finally coping with the worsening disease. There have been other movies about Alzheimer's before notably 'Away From Her' with Julie Christie but this is a much more rounded film. The disease is shown from the point of view of the sufferer and the impact on the family / caregiver. There are some unexpectedly moving scenes because they are done without excess sentimentality: when Alice finds out her elder daughter has inherited the gene for the disease, when Alice gives a speech on the disease, when her younger daughter becomes the caregiver. There are some funny situations too that help lighten the mood during some deeply dramatic moments especially the bungled suicide attempt.

There is a believability to the cast as a family which includes Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish and Kristen Stewart as the children and Alec Baldwin as the ultimately selfish husband. The dialog is realistic and funny. Kristen Stewart is well cast as the slightly rebellious actress daughter who steps up. Don't get the speech she was giving at the end though and don't know how they can expect an Alzheimer's patient to understand it.

Julianne Moore gives a all encompassing performance and she deserves an Oscar for this role in addition to the Golden Globe. She portrays the pain, fear, joy and affection without making things too awful during the deterioration. This is the best movie about Alzheimer's so far and an excellent movie about illness in general.

Permalink",False,"I honestly cannot remember the last time a movie made me more terrified of a disease. In 101 minutes Still Alice makes Alzheimer's look like an absolute hell. This is credited to some superb directing, painfully captivating writing, and a jaw-dropping performance by Julianne Moore. Moore plays Alice Howland, a professor at Columbia University known for her sharp mind and quick wit. She has an ideal life with a loving husband and three beautifully happy adult children. This seemingly perfect life takes a sharp left turn when Alice is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. Needless to say the movie doesn't get any happier from this point on. We get to watch a slow, painful decline as Alice's mind deteriorates over time, with absolutely nothing she can do about it. It's undeniably one of the most depressingly powerful films I've seen in a long time.

Still Alice doesn't try to play any tricks or go off the rails with its narrative. It presents the story in as straightforward a way as possible, which completely works towards the film's advantage. In the beginning we're introduced to Alice and her family, getting a clear sense of where her life begins, while also providing small subtle hints that something is amiss. Then of course we move on to the diagnosis and it's all downhill from there. It's a beautifully paced film that pulls us deeper down this hole along with Alice. The severity of her disease is portrayed in a multitude of depressingly ingenious ways both visually and via dialogue. It's all so painfully real and cripplingly believable as we watch this poor soul wither away.

As this is a character piece one would expect great performances and man oh man does Still Alice deliver on that front. There's only so much to say about the great Julianne Moore. I've always been a big fan of hers and Still Alice only lifts my already shining opinion. Alec Baldwin plays Alice's husband while Kate Bosworth and Kristen Stewart play Alice's daughters. Watching as these relationships deteriorate along with Alice's mind is devastating, but its one of the most endearing aspects of the whole film. Stewart's performance is a significant weak point acting wise, but the intentions behind her character are great and she doesn't take away from the impact of the film.

I think what's so impressive about this film is how well it executes such a touchy subject matter. It could have easily slipped into the dreaded realm of tacky melodrama, playing out like Lifetime's Movie of the Week. But the genius of Still Alice comes from it's subtleties in performances and the way Alice tries desperately to downplay her disease. Her attempts to maintain identity and keep the relationships she has with her family is absolutely heartbreaking.

The nuances here are what make Still Alice so amazing and so heartfelt. I really felt like I was watching this tragic story as a tragic reality, never being pulled out of the experience. I was captivated from start to finish during this beautiful tearjerker that gives us one of the best performances of the entire year. I got so much more than I could have asked for out of Still Alice, and I will be thinking about this heartbreaking film for a long, long while."

Permalink",False,"Oscar bait for actresses falls in two categories: physically transform or go through emotional turbulence. Still Alice is the latter.

There is really nothing wrong with Still Alice as a film and Julianne Moore has one of her most powerful performances in Alice Howland.

Alice is an intellectual, a world renowned linguistics professor, happily married with three ambitious children and financially well off. One day she has a difficult time finding the right her words during an academic presentation, a linguistics expert forgetting her words of all things. Concerned, she consults medical professionals and receives a devastating diagnosis that will test her and her family's mind, body and spirit.

Still Alice is the film adaptation of Lisa Genova's novel about one woman's slow descent into dementia. Genova's story is told from Alice's point of view and diverts from the overly sentimental savior aspect of the family turned caretakers perspective typical of the genre. Still Alice is emotional and a must watch for anyone affected by Alzheimer's disease.

Personally, I have a history of Alzheimer's in my family lineage, though not directly. I am petrified, frozen in fear, that I will get the disease when I am older, having seen the lengthy disease's toll on loved ones. I have seen mothers unable to recognize their own children, their own flesh and blood. I have seen the struggle families go through dealing with the fits of rage and have seen the dedication of selfless patient live in caretakers and aids.

The direction of Still Alice by Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer is purposely jumpy, with time and location lapses, to have the audience endure the same disorienting confusion as Alice. The tones and focus of the film are beautiful and further facilitate and reflect the mood and emotions of the scenes, with the focus and tones softening the more the disease progresses.

Alzheimer's disease is a heartbreaking and intimate neurodegenerative disease poignantly known as the slow goodbye. Everyone will be talking about Moore's performance as Alice Howard, and the recognition is much deserved in capturing the anguish, frustration and despair during the early stages of the disease. That said, I personally feel that Kate Burton's portrayal of Ellis Grey was far superior at inhabiting the vacancy and complete loss of self. Unfortunately Moore's eyes give her away as being cognizant and aware, even if it is subconsciously.

The final act of the film is difficult and painful to watch. This loss of time, who you were, what you are, is horrendous and frightening. I just don't think the film will have a profound effect with longevity as the supporting characters' emotional connection to Alice is too superficial and the movie sways into mawkishness.

Permalink",False,"I love, absolutely love movies like this one. Usually movies about illness, mental disorders etc. have their own genre. They always make 'em big and at some point in the movie, the character - which is always larger then life kind of person that everyone just love to feel sorry for - is in a scene with a very dramatic setting, like a rainy night for example, and there's no one around and they maybe even have some overly exaggerated words of wisdom and a very important message about life and such.

Not 'Still Alice'. A film so delicate and subtle. With an interesting story, written so fluently, you never feel strangled by overdoing or over trying. The characters seem so realistic, especially Juliane Moore's Alice and Kristen Stewart's Lydia. This is also the place to state that I'm so happy K. Stewart is back. For those who only know her from 'The Twilight Saga', this performance would be a big surprise. A great one. Her role might seem random at first but in my opinion is portrayed beautifully with certain authenticity and comfort that not many actors can easily achieve.

It's a heartbreaking story but it's told in a perfect containment. It's very 'homey' like, in the way you experience it; small, intimate, gentle and in many ways very brave. Exactly for the reasons of not going all the way, not shoving it in down your throat, not raping you into it. With all said, it also provides a peephole into a dark world many of us can not understand or probably don't even bother to think of. How fragile we are.

It's not a filmmaking masterpiece, but still a must see film nonetheless, mainly for it's heart."

Permalink",False,"Undoubtedly, one of the greatest actresses of the last twenty years is the multi-faceted Julianne Moore. And Moore is coming back for more, with the role that might finally land her a Best Actress Academy Award. In ""Still Alice"", Moore stars as Dr. Alice Howland, a successful college professor who is unexpectedly diagnosed with an early onset case of Alzheimer's Disease. Alice is supported by her loving husband John, and her three adult children. Directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westomoreland orchestrate a slow moving film in ""Still Alice"", that might not be for the impatient viewer. But they do a solid, but not spectacular job, in depicting Alice's progressively downward spiral due to her Alzheimers. But the role of Alice needed a home run performance to authentically demonstrate the personal and health effects of Alzheimers; and Moore did even more what was asked her to do in her role as Alice. I would be shocked if she does not win a Best Actress Oscar. ""Still Alice"" still had some other good acting performances; including Alec Baldwin playing Alice's sympathetic husband John. And we also get some pretty decent work from Kristen Stewart playing Alice's youngest daughter Lydia; glad her twilight days are over. Yes, ""Still Alice"" does require for you to be suited up with a handkerchief upon watching, but it will still be worth your time. And, did I say Moore? **** Good"

Permalink",True,"Still Alice is a smart, poignant drama about a brilliant Columbia University professor losing her mind as a result of early onset Alzheimer's Disease. The script is excellent, and the acting is first-rate.

Julianne Moore does her best work as the college professor dealing with a life where she has it all - career, respect, children who are thriving, a doting, loving husband, and a busy life in New York City. Alec Baldwin plays her caring husband who tries to cater to his wife's expanding needs as he excels as a practicing physician and she exhibits increasingly debilitating effects of the disease.

One of her daughters played by Kristen Stewart lives in LA, attempting to find work in the theater. There is some friction, but it is the good kind.

Julianne Moore should be considered a front-runner as the awards season approaches. She will win something whether - it is an Oscar, a Golden Globe or a Spirit Award, but she would be my favorite for an Oscar. Her performance was flawless and moving. Also excellent was Kristen Stewart in the supporting role of her daughter. Stewart is also perfectly on point in this film as the empathetic, poetic daughter.

See it.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice is not, yet another awareness movie campaign on the disease. it is a heart wrenching, beautiful film about a family, no, a woman dealing with a devastating diagnosis. You slowly get into Alice's head, witness the subtle shift in her behavior, her struggles, and it's heartbreaking. If you have any history with a chronic disease, and even if you don't, you will cry during this movie. It's an emotionally-charged film that has the particularity to be easy to watch.

The film is very much about Alice and her disease. It's focused on her and the other characters are basically supporting roles but they all really carry the story perfectly. As much as you see subtle changes in her, however fast they come, you also get to have a glimpse of how it's affecting her family. The story is told from Alice's perspective, she is the center and she is telling her story in her own way. It's about loss, it's psychologically violent and scary. I mentioned earlier that the audience get into Alice's head and it's translated in the images. It gets white and hazy for us when it gets that way for her.

Julianne Moore's performance is Oscar worthy. I would not be surprised if she snatched some awards this year because at this point her nomination is inevitable. She delivered a captivating performance for such a demanding and what I'm sure must have been a challenging role. Moore applied so much authenticity in her performance that you won't leave the movie theater without acknowledging your feelings, specially if you have a history with a chronic illness. Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth & Hunter Parrish pick up where Julianne Moore left off and add on to the realistic feel of the film. They put together a powerful and moving film, an emotional roller coaster that I would recommend everyone to get on.

In my opinion this is a great film but I'd like to know you take on it, tweet me @wornoutspines or share your opinion in the comment section?"

She is what the movie worth watching in the first place. Without her, the film would probably be maybe a 5 or 6/10. She became the character. I didn't see Julianne Moore. I saw a poor, tortured woman suffering from Alzheimer's. She definitely deserved her Oscar for Actress in a Leading Role. The one other thing I liked was her husband. He wasn't an asshole. Normally you would expect a significant other to bail on the main character once they find out they're dying or sick, which is unrealistic and a stupid way to cause drama. Here he stays, which is really nice. It made me truly believe he cared about this woman no matter what. That about does it for things that were worth mentioning. Everything thing else is rather unexceptional. Kristen Stewart wasn't bad, but she certainly wasn't good either. That phrase is probably the best way to describe the rest of the things in the film. Wasn't bad, but perhaps not good. Anyway, I still like the film and would recommend it, mainly for Julianne Moore."

Permalink",True,"Alice Howland has a brilliant career. She's witty, happily married and the proud mother to three teenaged children. Then she begins to forget the odd word. She occasionally loses her sense of direction. Alice is concerned but she's barely fifty - how bad can it be? A visit to a consultant delivers the shocking news - she has Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Her life, and the lives of her friends and family, are turned upside down. But Alice refuses to be defined by her disease. Her memory may be fading but she her resolution stays strong.

Hollywood has a pretty unfortunate track record in handling medical conditions like Alzheimer's. Cinematic good intentions become hollow,over-sentimental tearjerkers. Fortunately, Still Alice avoids this trap. It spends its time creating carefully-drawn characters that you can believe in. Each step of Alice's mental deterioration is sensitively handled, whilst the devastation the disease wreaks on the family is heartbreakingly portrayed.

There's an understandable reaction to a film like this - why watch it? There won't be a magical cure appearing in the third act to save the day. A happy ending is not on the cards. So why see Still Alice?

The first and foremost reason is Julianne Moore. Moore has cleaned up during the recent awards season, winning virtually all the trophies she was nominated for. She capped this off with a Best Actress Oscar win. And rightly so. Her performance brilliantly conveys Alice's frustration at having to deal with the disease, the dementia that is slowly destroying her memory and her ability to communicate. It's often snidely remarked that portraying an affliction can fast-track you to Oscar success. Moore's restrained yet powerful performance is fully deserving of the accolades showered upon it.

Another reason to see this film is Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's direction of their own screenplay, based on Lisa Genova's novel. They approach the material sensitively and with great care.

At the core of the film is Alice's resolve to not lie down and be a victim. She knows that the quality of her life is slowly being eaten away by Alzheimer's but she refuses to give up. In a memorable scene, Alice decides to speak at an Alzheimer's Association meeting. As a linguistics professor, this would have been a walk in the park - now it's an uphill struggle. Armed only with several sheets of paper, a highlighter pen and her steadfast determination, she battles on.

There are other, less challenging movies around but I strongly recommend you see Still Alice. It's not an easy watch but that's evidence of its power and its integrity. Ultimately, Still Alice is that increasingly rare artefact - an intelligent, thought-provoking film about real life issues, with characters you genuinely care about.

Permalink",True,"It is a bit annoying when you hear about Oscar wins for films that have not even been released in Great Britain, which was the case with this film, starring the previously four time Oscar nominated actress, I was definitely up for seeing it. Basically Columbia University linguistics professor Dr. Alice Howland (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Julianne Moore) is mother to three young adult children: Lydia (Twilight's Kristen Stewart), Anna (Superman Returns' Kate Bosworth) and Tom (Hunter Parrish), and married to husband John (Alec Baldwin), she has recently celebrated her fiftieth birthday. But things start to change for Alice when she starts to forget words and more besides, visiting the doctor she is tested and eventually diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease, it was genetically inherited from her father, and it could be passed to her children, they are devastated when she tells them. Two of Alice's children are tested for the gene, eldest daughter Anna tests positive, she is pregnant with twins, but they will not develop the gene, junior doctor and her only son Tom tests negative, Lydia chooses not to get tested. Alice becomes concerned and afraid for her future and how it will be affected by the disease, so trying to improve her memory she tries to memorise random words she writes down and hides them to look at later, she also sets up important personal questions on her phone that she tasks herself to answer every morning, finally she records herself a video to watch should she be unable to answer the questions instructing herself to commit suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills. The disease progresses, and her family and all acquaintances are strained, Alice loses her academic position and job, John has work demands meaning he is unable to look after her often enough, the children are forced to help with her continually increasing needs, and Lydia is being elusive as she is trying to get into acting. Alice still just able to speak attends a Alzheimer's conference and delivers a moving speech about her difficulties she is forced to endure, she gets a standing ovation, and following this, over several months, the disease takes it toll to the point when Alice finds it difficult to answer her questions and with spelling. It is attending a play starring Lydia that it gets to the point where Alice is initially unable to recognise her own daughter, further stress follows when John says that they have to move due to their financial situation, and Alice loses her phone, it is a month later that she finds it, but her disease means that she has no knowledge of how long it had been missing. Alice one day has a video chat with Lydia, trying to open a file sent to her she inadvertently opens the video addressed to herself, it is the video of herself telling how to commit suicide, having regressed even further she willingly complies with her own instructions, with some difficulty, she gets the pills, but an interruption by the caretaker means that she spills them onto the floor, and she quickly forgets what she is doing, so her suicide attempt possibility ends. In the end John moves to Minnesota for work purposes, Lydia moves from her California home to stay with and care for her worsening mother, she reads her a segment from her new play she will be acting in, questioned about its meaning, Alice is barely able to form words, she only manages to speak on: ""love"". Also starring Daniel Gerroll as Eric Wellman, Stephen Kunken as Dr. Benjamin and Shane McRae as Charlie Howland-Jones. Moore absolutely deserved to win the three big awards, especially the Oscar which she had been overdue a while, her performance as the slowly deteriorating and vulnerable mother and wife is fantastic, Baldwin being serious could have been on a bit more but is alright, and Stewart, who I have been iffy about since Twilight, does actually do well. It is a simple story, seeing the affects a horrible disease such as Alzheimer's has on both one individual and all those who care about that person, her memory seems to go faster to due to her high level of education, I agree there are moments of predictability and it is maybe not as deep as a film like Amour, but I think it is one of those films that sticks with you and you should see, a most worthwhile drama. Good!

Permalink",True,"I found the premise intriguing, and it's something I'm surprised hasn't been tackled so often on the big screen. Alzheimer's is an incredibly tragic disease that even to this day is poorly understood, and it seems an obvious go-to to base a story around. The thought of losing memories and cognitive abilities is one that terrifies me and many others, and is undoubtedly an incredible struggle to those who suffer from it.

This is kind of a hard film to watch as it goes on as the titular Alice goes through the degenerative effects of her unfortunate condition. I personally don't have much experience in dealing with people with Alzheimer's or Dementia, but from what little experience I do have I felt Julianne Moore's performance encapsulates what this disease does to those affected and those close to them. As the film goes on, she gets less mentally stable, more disoriented, more forgetful, and more depressed as her condition gets worse, and this is even juxtaposed as she leaves a video memo for herself in the future to commit suicide should her condition get worse, and the difference between her in the memo and her in the present is clear as day. She becomes an absolute wreck by the end of it, and it's a shame since there's really nothing that can be done to fix it. Many big issues are tackled throughout the story, such as Alice's guilt upon learning she has passed her condition on to her daughter, even though she had no way of knowing she could have had this rare version of Alzheimer's considering her parents had died too early on for it to have been known to her. There is excellent chemistry between Alice and her daughter Lydia throughout the film, and the film ends with a touching, even if bittersweet moment between them. Just about anything that can go wrong does go wrong throughout the story, yet it remains realistically hopeful while diving into seriously dark themes.

I would highly recommend this film to those who like drama. It's a very good film in general with an interesting premise, talented actors, and effective execution, and a fulfilling story that's handled with proper care.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice

There are some tracks that they could have easily chosen to thicken the plot or add some twists and enter the dark zone but they keep it light here for the most part of it and sums it up to 'hope' in the end. Still Alice is a feature that doesn't come often, it offers everything expected and some more in addition to a heart in the centre of it pumping all the way through in each and every frame of it keeping it alive and soothing over its short runtime of around 100 minutes. The writer-director duo Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland are magnificent and dedicated to the last word of their work which is visible completely onto the screen. But in the end, it's all in Julianne Moore's side of the show and boy what a show she has to offer, she is flat out brilliant and heartwarming along with a great supporting cast like Kirsten Stewart and Alec Baldwin. Still Alice has fast pace natured script, intriguing and gripping screenplay, majestic performances and an immortal soul in it.

Permalink",False,"This is a film about how unfair life can be. A once happy marriage, both spouses with successful careers, looking forward to grandchildren, dissolves into a single focus, Alice's medical condition. Alice Howland (Julieanne Moore), is a linguistics professor at Columbia University and her husband a physician, is being sought after by the Minnesota Mayo Clinic.

Alice knows something is wrong, others find her behavior odd or annoying, but no one would have guessed at age 50 her seeming absentmindedness is early onset Alzeheimers. Understandably, Alice attempts to keep her life as it once was. When her work performance slips she explains she has Alzheimers and plans to keep working. She is informed by the University that is not possible.

Alice's husband is not the loving, caring husband you'd hope he'd be. He becomes annoyed and looks for opportunities to be away or at work. Two of her three children decided to be tested for early on set familial Alzheimer's disease. It does not have a happy ending, but with 10,000 people turning 65 everyday you might want to see this one in case this becomes your family's story."

Permalink",False,"This is a beautiful film. I was blown away by emotional performances of the actresses. Alice has had a nice and happy life before she gets Alzheimer, which rips everything that she has acquired through her life from her. The disease leads to her uncomfortable life, and she is not able to be like her. That is the thing we are the most afraid of. I t is important for us to live by ourselves independently and like our selves. Alice gets to have a weak recognition about who she is and people around her, which makes her suffer from it. However, the most stunning scene is the warm support from her family in this hard situation. No matter how worse Alice's condition is getting, they always stay with her. I was impressed with her family. Besides, this film uses a beautiful representation of a butterfly as a short life, which reminds us of a short life as same as Alice. Meanwhile, the camera work is reflected by Alice's condition. As she got worse, the monitor gets vague. We can see things as same as Alice. The last scene also moved my heart.

Permalink",False,"'Still Alice' is a film that boasts a remarkable central performance from Julianne Moore. It tells the story of a University linguistics professor (Moore) as she is diagnosed a rare form of Auzheimer's disease.

Richard Glatzer's direction of the movie can be viewed as a parallel to his own life and personal struggle as he lived with ALS disease. 'Still Alice' is full of emotive shots as the characters show care and support to Moore as she tries to continue juggling her career and family life with the disease. Aspects such as the music and cinematography is given a very straight-forward approach to allow the actors' performances to tell the story and to add a true to life direction.

Based on the novel of the same name written by Lisa Genova, the screenplay is very faithfully adapted. The film really focuses on the story and the dialogue between the characters and some scenes and interactions are extremely moving thanks to how well it is written.

Julianne Moore is perfect as the main character. She portrays her struggle with the disease with so much inner strength and dignity. Moore is supported by a solid cast such as Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart but are outshone by her brilliant performance.

Overall, 'Still Alice' is a very good film. It is very touching and moving tale about coping with such a life changing and destructive disease. However, it seems to only be memorable due to Julianne Moore's incredible acting. I have given this film a final rating of 3.5 stars."

Permalink",True,"I will not belabor the points made by so many who have already contributed glowing reviews to this movie, which features one of my favorite actresses (Julianne Moore) deliver one of her finest performances. There was one note, however, which I found to be incredibly ham-fisted and which detracted from my overall enjoyment of an otherwise outstanding movie:

SPOILER ALERT!!!! =================

In the scene where Alice is about to drink down all of the Rohypnol tablets which she hoarded while still lucid and coherent, at the EXACT moment that she raised the tablets to her lips, the front door slammed shut as her daughter entered the house, alarmed that her mother had been left alone for the day. Of course, in true Hollywood fashion, this caused Alice to drop all of the tablets to the floor! PLEASE -- PLEASE -- PLEASE do not insult me as a viewer with such a ham-fisted plot device! Rather let the daughter enter the home a half hour later, in time to have the hospital revive her mother -- or rework the ending so that this scene becomes the final scene. But DON'T INSULT ME AS A VIEWER WITH SUCH A TRITE, PREDICTABLE NARRATIVE! (Also, Rohypnol is not available for prescription in the United States -- it may only be imported by travelers from other nations, in strictly limited supplies. How did Alice's physician prescribe this sleeping pill, and where did Alice fill the prescription? This is not nitpicking -- these are valid observations, and a reworking of the script should have caught and remedied these errors, the first being far, far more serious than the latter two.)

This heavy-handed and blatantly false note detracted from my enjoyment of what was in all other respects an extremely moving, deeply touching experience. Obviously, this is not a movie which one ENJOYS watching -- but it DOES offer the viewer a portal through which to view the world of both an ALZ patient and the caregivers for such patients.

Julianne Moore certainly outdid herself in this role. It will be very difficult for her to rise to so high a bar in future productions (""Children of Men"" came close, albeit an earlier work than ""Still Alice"")....

Permalink",True,"This indie movie is about a woman who recently found out that she was with Alzheimer's disease. The diagnose gradually changed her attitudes towards life. At that moment, she had a successful career as a PhD in Columbia University and also owned a perfect family. Memories fading away, she made several decisions, including spent more time with her family, made a speech in front of a group of Alzheimer patients and recorded a video to instruct herself to suicide. On the one hand, the movies shot the process which the decisions came up in Alice's mind and formed finally. On the other hand, Alice's family also experienced a series of changes. The lines which I remembered most clearly is from Alice's speech at the Alzheimer's Association - ""But I still have moments in the day of pure happiness and joy. And please do not think that I am suffering, I am not suffering. I am struggling, struggling to be a part of things, to stay connected to who I once was. So, living in the moment I tell myself"". Living in the moment, that is the exact gist I analyzed from this movie. It is also the most moving character of the heroine. It is hard to imagine such optimism out of Alice, such a sympathetic woman that everything she had worked for in her entire life was going. Superficially, the movie is talking about losing. The true purpose underneath is reminding people of what we used to own and enjoy the precious present. You can never predict which one between incidence and opportunity will come in the first place. By appreciating the present may we be able to live an optimistic life and make something with virtue.

Permalink",True,"As a person with a neurological disease, and the daughter and grand daughter/caregiver of tow that suffered from Alzheimer's disease, I have to debate just a bit on one comment left here.

While this movie is Hollywood, the story and cast did try to make things somewhat realistic and brought some attention to the disease. People do get a glimpse of the beginning stages of Alzheimer's, I don't think anyone is ready to watch the true heartbreak of the end result.

The idea behind the movie was the impact on Alice and then her family, this could have been explored more, but it is a 2 hour movie. I was glad they stuck with Julianne's character and the digression into her past, which is of course what happens. The moment of the left suicide instructional video when Alice could not follow the simplest of instructions, shows the disease and how debilitating it is, even early on. The secondary characters, were just that, secondary and what are they supposed to do? In this respect, the movie hit a home run..absolutely. The question being ""What do we do with her now and who cares what Lydia thinks?""

I was impressed that one of the family members (like myself) choose to alter their lives and care for someone who ultimately has no idea who they are.

The end, well..if you saw the movie you most likely had known someone with the disease. I thought they ended that in a positive way.

Permalink",False,"What a movie. I read that it's heart-breaking (what else could you expect from a drama), yet I couldn't imagine how strong the feeling will be. ""Still Alice"" introduces the viewer with the hardships that a person with Alzheimer's and their closest relatives are facing. Throughout the movie you get familiar with degradation of the main character's personality, caused by gradation of the disease.

Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart did a great job fulfilling such strong supporting roles. Kristen Stewart remarkably embodied Alice Howland's youngest daughter Lydia, which suffered seeing her mother struggle with day-to-day tasks. Julianne Moore managed to not annoy me, so I consider it as a job well done.

Permalink",True,"I've been hearing for a while now that it's Julianne Moore's year. If you ask me, every year should be Julianne Moore's year, but nevertheless, this is the conventional wisdom being passed around by those who make their living spending an unseemly amount of time tracking the Academy Awards as if it were some sort of horse race that actually matters.

Best that I can tell, 2014 was considered an unusually weak year in the Best Actress field, even by Hollywood's horrid standards of roles for women. I didn't think it was weak at all, but I suppose if we must restrict our choices to American films deemed by industry insiders as Oscar Contenders that were also released by distributors that can afford to mount multi-million dollar awards campaigns, then yes, it probably was. (Don't get me started.) So, much like a few years ago when Jeff Bridges received his lifetime achievement, gold-watch Oscar for a mediocre picture nobody saw, Julianne Moore has become the presumptive front-runner for a middling movie that hasn't even come out yet. She's overdue. Everybody loves her. It's time.

It also helps that Still Alice is the kind of movie that wins Academy Awards. It's tasteful to a fault, exploring a terrifying subject with the utmost decorum. You feel bad when it's over, but not too bad. Adapted from Lisa Genova's novel by the married writing-directing team of Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, the film stars Moore as Alice Howland, a super-cerebral linguistics professor at Columbia University, stricken with early onset Alzheimer's.

There's no way for a movie about Alzheimer's disease to not be inherently horrifying. An awful part of life is that we all eventually learn to accept that our bodies will someday betray us, but the mind is a totally different matter. Losing physical ability is sadly inevitable; losing comprehension is the stuff of nightmares. Moore, a brilliant actress, does an expectedly outstanding job conveying Alice's slow drift away from the world. Confusion gives way to helplessness, and then terrible fear.

If only the movie deserved Moore's precision work, and if only there were more to this character than the cheap irony of a language professor losing her words. Still Alice is set in the plush, weirdly stilted upper Manhattan that I only thought existed whenever Woody Allen used to try and make a tragedy about WASPs. Everything is so genteel and cushioned, exemplified by Alec Baldwin's uncharacteristically terrible turn as her research scientist husband, coiffed in a $500 haircut inexplicable for a lab rat while over-enunciating some seriously awkward dialogue.

It all feels so timid and Hallmark-ish, particularly when stacked against previous, gut-wrenching Alzheimer's dramas like Iris and Away From Her, films that rooted around in the husband's POV with a conflicted, messy anxiety Still Alice keeps carefully at bay. This is a movie of pristine surfaces, and an over-determined camera strategy that has the other performers receding out of focus as Moore's facilities narrow.

The one rogue element here is Kristen Stewart's outstanding performance as Moore's black-sheep daughter, who earned her mother's ire while struggling to get started as an actress in the downtown theatre scene. The rest of Still Alice's supporting cast (including a wretched Kate Bosworth) is fussy and self-conscious, Stewart simply is. There's such a rawness to her talent, so we all really need to get over the easy Twilight jokes and embrace her sullen unpredictability and lanky moments of unexpected grace. She's the real deal.

Glatzer and Westmoreland certainly know what they've got here. In lieu of an ending of their own, they just have Stewart read aloud from Tony Kushner's Angels in America. She sells the heck out of an emotional crescendo that someone else wrote about a totally different frightening disease, so even the climax is borrowed and once-removed.

I don't care whose year it is, these two actresses deserved better.

Julianne Moore was fabulous as Alice, and there is one scene in particular toward the end that the two share that pretty much defines the film.

Permalink",True,"I hadn't particularly wanted to see this film as I couldn't imagine anything more depressing for this 68-year-old reviewer than watching a movie about the onset of Alzheimer's.

Anyway, I saw an interview with Julianne Moore in which she claimed the movie wasn't at all sad.

I'm afraid little Julianne was telling a great big fib.

It's as sad and depressing as you can get, and reinforces all the fears that people of my age nurture as the years roll on. In the movie, Moore's character, Alice, is a famous linguistics professor, and her equally well-bred husband is a renowned medical professor. She discovers at the young age of only 50 that she is suffering from an early onset form of the disease. Moore, being the brilliant actress that she is, acts her socks off and is utterly believable as she slowly starts to lose her mind. If any of you out there want to spend 101 minutes crying your eyes out, then go ahead and watch it, but buy a box of tissues first.

What pxxxxd me off about this movie was that yet again, Hollywood has set a film fairly and squarely amongst the upper-middle classes: the chattering classes, the academia, the 'haves' rather than the 'have- nots'. It is a world where 99% of us folk living in so-called western civilised society can only read and dream about. It is a world that is not inhabited by a vast majority of us humble movie goers.

So why does this bother me?

It bothers me, because Still Alice is not the first film I have seen on the sad subject of Alzheimer's, (and dementia, in general) – and indeed there have been a number of excellent documentaries on this subject – but it is the first, where the people affected, have had sufficient money and resources to deal with it in a civilised manner.

For most of us plebs out there in movie-land, the onset of dementia in our families is not only devastating emotionally for the families concerned, but it also turns our lives on our heads as we struggle to deal with a sick parent and struggle to find the money to make ends meet. The lack of sufficient funds and decent government support for most people to deal with this kind of problem in a civilised way is a fundamental issue that is totally ignored by this otherwise, well- produced film.

If you are going to do a mainstream Hollywood film about a difficult subject, at least cover all the bases and don't try to sanitize the problem. In the real world, Alzheimer's is a much more traumatic event than that shown in the film. Still Alice takes place in a rarefied, upper-middle class atmosphere.The luvvies of this world – i.e. the members of the Oscars academy can relate to this world so well - but the rest of us?

Great acting by Moore and Alec Baldwin does pretty good portrayal of her husband.

I can't really fault the film per se, but I do wish somebody is movie-land would write a story that us struggling plebs can relate to and not wrap up these terrible medical problems in cotton wool.

Permalink",False,"To make a movie, where the story is very predictable, is a big challenge in order to make the movie worth watching. Here it is very clear, that Julianne will become more and more affected by her Alzheimer decease.

When the story in it self is very easy to predict why watch the movie then? The focus is on how the disease in a more specific sense forces our protagonist and family to accept the prognoses and further how the disease in a specific sense affects the ability to express herself early on and how the lack of memory makes it more and more impossible to live the life without help.

Julianne plays the role with such a great ability to emphasize with the different aspects disease that she can show us the desperation and sadness involved with accepting this disease and it's consequences.

In the french movie ""amour"" we have seen the same theme described with the angle on how it affects a marriage and in relation to this how the dignity of the person with Alzheimer is very difficult to sustain.

Our relationship to friends and family is to a very big extent build upon memories with that person. To lose those memories is therefore also to lose the relationship and can you then answer the question ""why not commit suicide?"" with other than a ""yes""? And this question was one of those the occupied my mind watching the movie.

The ultimate end is to become the so called ""vegetable"" whose quality of life is nothing but the ""here&now"" situation.

To watch the movie is probably to prepare yourself to one of the variations of a terminal disease and it gives us an opportunity to reflect upon what is the very core of our existence.

The only annoyance is that it centers around a prototype family with a lot of success (more or less) and further involving giving and caring relationships. Would it have been disturbing to reflect upon the theme if our main characters had been from a lower social group or with another ethnic background?

Permalink",True,"I usually don't cry with movies, in fact I can count with the fingers in one hand the movies that have made me cry. Nevertheless this one has the honor to be one of them.

I think is hard to find something sadder than losing your identity. To be the void in life. And Alice describes it perfectly when she gives her speech about alzheimer, holding with her nails at the edge of the cliff she's about to fall. We are our memories, our experiences, our path. If they took that from us, we're lost. Until that moment in the film my feelings were of anguish, but then the speech was cathartic: Alice accepts what's coming, and learns that her best choice is to live the moment. Then the anguish fades, and peace founds its way: there is nothing to lose because everything is lost.

Julianne Moore is outstanding and the Oscar is well deserved. The rest of the cast is pretty well, even the expressionless Kristen Stewart (that scene in the stage...), who gives the needed counterpoint to turn a family drama into a chance to access her purest mother. I've loved that among the whole family of eminences, it has to be the rebel, untidy and social pariah daughter the one who finally gets a glimpse of her former mother by scratching the surface that almost everyone else thinks is Alice now. She treats her mother like her mother, not like furniture. And then is how Alices keeps being Alice. Still Alice.

Permalink",True,"As soon as the film began we were introduced to the main character who was a lecturer at university for linguistics, which is something I am planning on to go onto study at university in the next few months so I felt that this film touched me more personally. This is because she will have learned and based her career around words and language and communication, but as her early Alzheimer's develops she forgets more words, memories and those all important communication formats she used to base her career on.

I cried (not ashamed to admit it - trust me you will too) about half an hour into the film, when she wets herself when she cannot find the bathroom which would feel both dehumanising and embarrassing in front of her husband. This film has a very sad storyline with a predictable ending, but with good acting and good actors too such as Julianne Moor and Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart (with a stiff performance as usual).

It is a different outlook on the tragic disease, with a viewpoint from a woman that is nearer our age so it makes it a whole lot scarier and more relatable to us all. It is tragically sad with the fact that the primary character with the disease has a loving family, has lived a beautiful life and was supposed to live on to have a further beautiful life. She was 'fascinated with communication' but her capability to communicate is taken away all too soon, with the filming and acting done effectively in creating an emotional film.

Permalink",True,"I've read some of the positive and negative reviews of the film on this board and as happens on rare occasions, I kind of agree with both points of view. On one hand, Julianne Moore's performance is agonizingly effective in showing the ravages of a disease no one has control over. Then on the other hand, a fair number of reviewers referred to the 'sanitized' view the picture takes of Alzheimer's, never getting to the point at which victims lose all control and become a serious burden to their families. Fortunately I have not found myself in that situation or know of anyone close who might have been afflicted, so I can't really comment on the second point. The startling point in the film for me was when Alice Howland (Moore) outlined the instructions to herself to commit suicide when she could no longer answer a set of familiar questions. That would have made the film even more tragic had the plan not dissolved with Alice's worsening condition. However the scene where Alice was reminiscing with her husband (Alec Baldwin) about past good times shared, and he brought up the 'b...j.. on the beach', I felt totally let down by the otherwise sensitive nature of the script. Why the screen writers had to soil their product with a reference like that just totally demoralized me.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice was a heart wrenching and emotional piece of film that took everyone who watched it on a very real and raw journey. The film highlighted the reality of such an awful disease and just how such diseases do not discriminate and can become very real in anybodies life. The casting in this movie was incredible with relationships, in particular between Julianne Moore and Kristen Stewart, on a level that we can recognise in our own family dynamics. Honestly one of the most moving pieces of film of 2015 and one i would recommend to anybody who is willing to be taken on a very real journey that goes beyond just the world of cinema.

Permalink",False,"With julianne moore winning the Oscar for this film I had high hopes for this film and it is good even though it does have some problems. The premise of the film sees a language teacher suddenly get diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The film sees her and her family learn to live with this change. Now to the obvious, julianne moore is fantastic in this film. She came across as a normal human being which made it even more tragic and she really delivers a performance to remember. Another fantastic performance is by alec Baldwin who plays Moore's husband in the film. Their chemistry was really good and he also was a really nice likable guy in this film. However, I feel like the rest of the performances aren't great. Kristen stewart is pretty average in this film, I just don't like her as an actress and I actually find her very bland to watch. I do like kate Bosworth but she definitely was underused in this film. The story of her having to deal with the disease is really good and she has a really good progression throughout the film that makes you care as a viewer. However, there is a few too many subplots and the main one involving Stewart's character leaves much to be desired. The script is actually really good with some really good dramatic dialogue with some well placed humour. The style of her progression throughout the film worked its just at times the film drags and it becomes a bit repetitive. Overall I liked this movie and recommend it be seen."

Permalink",False,"Still Alice places us in the heart of a moving subject matter. Be wary, this film is an emotional ride. Julianne Moore is off the charts, superb in every way, shape and form. For someone who's not experiencing Alzheimer's in real life, Julianne draws all suspension of disbelief, from the moment she starts forgetting the simplest of things. Although Alice is central to the topic, writer/director duo Glatzer and Westmoreland show how family members are affected too. Kristen Stewart's usual awkward, hapless self fits the role of Alice's youngest daughter whilst Alec Baldwin tries to stay tough to keep the family from falling apart. The way the story unfolds on screen (because of its powerful performances) gives us all we need to know. Movies never make me cry (Green Mile and Marley & Me are exceptions), but one moment in the film nearly sent me over the edge. Still Alice is truly an amazing piece of work.

Permalink",True,"Still Alice is a sensitive portrayal of a woman's steady deterioration as a result of early onset Alzheimer's disease.

What makes this particularly powerful is that Alice is not your 'typical' Alzheimer's patient. She is young, intelligent, attractive and seems to have it all. It's a classic case of the higher you fly, the further you have to fall, and it helps to really bring to life what a horrific and distressing illness Alzheimer's can be.

There are a number of memorable scenes that captured this extremely well. - Alice visiting a care home and the staff assuming she is there on behalf of her own parent. - Her husband and children talking about her as if she wasn't there. - Her plan to kill herself once she gets to the more severe stages of the disease. - A truly affecting speech she gives to the Alzheimer's Association on what it's like to live with the condition. - Her husband being torn between caring for Alice and wanting to continue to pursue his own career.

Julianne Moore, who plays Alice, is faultless in the lead role. I really bought into her authenticity.

My only criticism is that the movie shies away from showing the latter stages of Alzheimer's disease and death. It ends while Alice is still able (just about) to interact with her family.

But this is a fine movie and I would highly recommend it.

Permalink",True,"When I had sat myself down to watch this movie, I was uninitiated, totally uninitiated. Of course, I had chosen it only because Julianne Moore, who played the protagonist in it, won herself the Oscar for it. Little did I have a notion of what to look for, what to think of it. But, having watched the gripping tale of ""Still Alice"", all I can say is – it truly has been a lesson, at least. A lesson that, one, can really never learn!

How?

Well, Imagine you're an accomplished, fulfilled, reasonably busy person – an illustrious career of a Linguistics professor by occupation, while an equally if not more charming, loving wife and a doting mother of three grown-up kids - a sure picture of an able hand in both spheres.

Done imagining?

Good! Now, imagine Letting go!

Yes - you read me alright! Letting go - all of these - first one by one, and then, almost, all at once.

It indeed comes as a cruel irony when for someone as Alice, when her very tools of trade – vocabulary – start to fail her, betray her. As we'd all do, she too brushes it aside at first, but for not too long. And thus she lands up at the neurologist's cabin one day, on eventually many more days - with tests, questionnaires, scans one by one pointing her towards the very inevitable. Yes, barely fifty years old, Alice has been detected with an early onset of Alzheimer's!

And not just that! Hers is a rare kind, one which is passed on genetically, one in which – if it has been passed on as can be tested out surely – the child will have a cent percent chance of developing it eventually. ""Sorry!"" – she chokes as she tries to, failingly, hold her fort strong, while breaking the news to her children towards whom she cannot but feel very responsible, and of course, guilty!

The decay, thereafter, is fast paced. She loses her words – slowly, erratically. She loses her job – essentially. She loses her basic abilities to get around, to get along in life. So much so that she soils her clothes because, well, because she could not locate the washroom in her very own home!

Your entire self-esteem - everything that was once yours and now you cannot remember, cannot quite be sure – they, now, are placed on a tricky slippery ground. It now all depends on if people do treat you as if you're still who you once were when you had, unfailingly, done them proud and done them good. Easier said, no?

So it is, for herself too! And all these - so suddenly and yet so surely that - she cannot but cope with it with a self-scripted, self-designed suicide plan.

But guess what? Even to accomplish that she needs help! And so she sets up herself, a version of herself from the past, to read out the instructions to that future version who has now reached the need to carry out the action plan – so that, still, the day can be saved. You can, really, be so embarrassed to live that you can well be pushed to choose not to, of course!

But no, she had over-estimated herself. She – despite her own planned instructions playing out to her in loops – turns out to be incapable of even that!

Imagine... Can you?

Well... personally - I can, somewhat at least, actually! Having been chronically clinically depressed for nearly a decade - surviving on anti-depressants that seemed to never work on your mood but instead on everything else and negatively, on sleeping tablets that your sleep or lack of it have by now got immune to, on analgesics that seem more compulsory than your daily meals, and essentially on Alertness boosters without which you wouldn't know how to get up just like you hadn't known for long how to sleep – I now, too closely, can imagine how it possibly can feel when you're no more, well, quite yourself! How it may feel to let go, lose, one by one. To want but fail to – care, for things; take care – of things; to eventually – therefore - give up, give in! To, lose yourself, inch by inch

But of course having said all that, at the very same time you cannot but feel blessed, fortunate - even lucky if you may - that you are still you and not her. Not Alice, yet.

Not, still, Alice What relief!

It's not easy to grope with a reality as dark, as uninitiated, sudden and yet as stark, as Alice's reality becomes. You start identifying with her sooner than you know You wish her strength and courage, and yet, inside your own heart, you start getting scared for her. For her, and perhaps, for yourself too?

""I wish I had cancer. People wear pink ribbons for you and go on long walks. I wouldn't have to feel like a socialI can't remember the word!""- She says.

And yes, it's true as hell! I know it!

And you know what? All you can do, if you want to help an Alice you meet on your way in life, is this:

Just, help them feel, still, important. Help them believe, if you can, that they are - despite the disease, despite the scans, the tests and the symptoms - they are...

Still, Alice!

Permalink",True,"I can see why this film was nominated (and won) so many awards. Never in my life have I seen a film quite like this. It was truly heartbreaking watching Moore's character go through so many phases of Alzheimer's. I actually have two older people in my family who are currently dealing with this disease. A few years back, another one of my family members was also diagnosed with Alzheimer's and passed away just last year. With that being said, from what I have learned from dealing with people that have this disease, it is this. You must be patient and willing to adapt and accept the fact that they have Alzheimer's and that there is nothing that anyone can do to reverse that. The best thing that you could possibly do is to be there for them in their time of need and to always keep a sharp eye on them, no matter what. Moreover, the patience factor really comes into play when they might ask you certain things in a continuous loop, like how Moore's character Alice did with Baldwin's character John, who played her husband in the movie....or how Alice would forget her own daughter's name (Lydia, played by Kristen Stewart), even going as far as confusing her with her sister at one point.

In summary, even if you don't have anyone in your family that has this disease, or don't know any friends or acquaintances that do, see this film anyway. Moore's performance was spot on and gave a stunningly realistic impression as to what life is like for someone living with this disease. I would recommend this film to anyone without hesitating!

Permalink",False,"I suspect that there may be no more terrifying word in the English language than ""Alzheimer's."" We know what it means. It's a terrible disease - probably, as one looks ahead at life, the one we dread more than any other possibility. Other diseases may take your life, but Alzheimer's robs you of your memory, your identity, your personality. It takes away who you are. ""Still Alice"" tackles the issue in a moving and sensitive way. Not overly dramatic, it's nevertheless a compelling story of one woman and her family dealing with this horrible disease.

A fictional story, it revolves around Alice Howland, a superstar professor of linguistics at Columbia University in New York City, who's just celebrating her 50th birthday as the movie opens. Having just marked that milestone myself a couple of years ago, perhaps that makes the story hit home a little more. There are signs in Howland's life that something's wrong. Little, unimportant things that she has trouble remembering. Who among us hasn't face that challenge. But one day, out for a jog, she suddenly realizes that she doesn't have a clue where she is. Frightened, she consults a neurologist and eventually gets the dreaded diagnosis: early onset Alzheimer's. Sharing the news with her husband and children, the rest of the movie is a chronicle of her slow descent and how she and her family react to it.

Howland is played by Julianne Moore. Moore is usually a fine actress, and she displays her talents again here. She's believable, and she makes Howland an object not of pity but of sympathy. She shows us a woman of great courage and dignity who has to deal with the increasingly undignified reality of her life. Alec Baldwin plays her husband John, supportive but confused; not really sure how to move on with life in the circumstances. Of Alice's children, the primary one was Lydia, played by Kristen Stewart. Lydia is the youngest child, living on the other side of the country, pursuing an acting career against her mother's wishes. They have a troubled relationship, which is tested by Alice's sickness. All the main actors did a fine job.

This is a sad movie. There's nothing uplifting about it; neither is there anything uplifting about this disease. This movie is what it should be, in other words. Alzheimer's Disease really is a disease that leaves no real hope. It just progresses. I was pleased that the movie ended before Alice was too far gone. She could still enjoy company with Lydia; she could still understand the concept of love. The movie faded abruptly after that acknowledgement, and yet even though it was a relief not to see Alice degenerate any further, the movie nevertheless leaves you on a bit of a downer, because you know it only gets worse from there.

Still, it's extremely well done. It doesn't make light of the disease, but it also doesn't sensationalize it. It's the life of one woman and her family, struggling as best they can to cope with this terrible situation. (7/10)"

Julianne Moore in Still Alice proves us for the hundred times that she is one of the greatest actress of all time... She totally deserves her Oscar. But I have to mention all the actors who played in this movie because they're all great... Special mention to Kristen Stewart and Hunter Parrish.

Permalink",False,"One of the more affecting and realistic films made about Alzheimer's disease that I can recall, Still Alice is an emotionally charged drama that deserves the plaudits it received upon initial release and features the always consistent Julianne Moore at her most quietly powerful best.

Directed by duo Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, Still Alice was an extremely personnel film for the two as Glatzer was a victim of ALS, co-directing this film via an Ipad due to not being able to speak. In the time since Still Alice's release in cinemas Glatzer has sadly passed away but Still Alice will always be his lasting legacy on the way in which these horrible diseases affect all humans, no matter their circumstances. The direction of Alice is a real highlight of the films production and never does the story surrounding Professor Howland feel overly manipulative or played for cheap tears, every aspect whether sad or joyous feels real and thought out, a carefully constructed journey to the deepest recesses of the human minds failings that the cast nails to perfection.

The recipient of the Best Actress Oscar at this year's Academy Awards ceremony it's not hard to see why Moore was the only sure fire win of the night with her turn as Alice Howland. Moore is likable, affable and most importantly someone we feel for and after many years of quality works Still Alice feels like the perfect reward for her both in a ceremonies sense but also a role sense. After watching Still Alice it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role and it's a credit to Moore that she nails some tricky material in the way in which she does, try not to be moved by Moore's delivery of a speech Alice makes to fellow disease victims. Surrounded by quality supports in Alec Baldwin and the thankfully non lip biting Kristen Stewart, Still Alice has a fine array of acting turns that help elevate the affecting material above the normal TV like disease/sickness movies that often flood the marketplace.

Made with a heart and soul that can only come from personnel experiences, Still Alice is a finely tuned drama that features one of recent history's most fully formed female lead roles. While there are some moments and subplots that feel slightly out of place and some small moments of unneeded mawkishness, Still Alice is quality filmmaking that only the most stone hearted of viewers wouldn't be affected by.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice is and interesting look into Alzheimer's Disease and how it effects the person and their family, but it does have faults.

While the story is good, at times the main character was not that likable, which I felt was necessary for this story in order to feel sympathy. There are times when you just want something bad to happen. There are also times when the movie tries to be sad, but it isn't, it tries to be a tearjerker scene, but it fails. With that, Julianne Moore did do a good job acting. Some of her scenes were overacted, which took away from the feel of the movie. At times the other actors over shadowed the main character, making them more likable and interesting.

The camera work was the most disappointing. They tried to go for the feel that she was separated from everyone else, but it was distracting. They blurred the background so much in almost every scene when she isn't in a house that it took me out of the movie. It would make sense do this is in the more dramatic, she is lost, etc. scenes, but they did it all the time.

While a good movie, it has problems that really distracted me and took me out of the movie. It never felt too long, but it felt like I was watching a movie, which doesn't happen when you watch a really good movie. I need to rewatch it sometime to reevaluate my score because it had me stuck between two points, this will also allow me to see how it holds up upon multiple viewings. Still Alice is still a good movie to go check out, it just has problems that annoyed me, they may not annoy you, but they are there."

Permalink",False,"While you could also sum the movie up with a song (""Alice? Who the ... is Alice?""), the movie is much more than that. Some people will go to the TV drama of the week stigma, which is also a shame. TV has gotten better, even if mostly in TV shows/series. So while it may feel like something that could also be a story for one of those slots, that wouldn't do the movie or the performances in it any justice.

Julianne Moore is center stage, but everyone around her is also very good. Some of them being known for TV shows by the way (I wouldn't call that irony myself). Even if you haven't read what the movie is about, the first scene where it's planted or rather hinted at (during a speech), will be very clear. So while we go on a ride with the main character, we might start to think about life in general, about being, about memories and a lot of other stuff. There's a lot to discuss ... even when it seems to be a dead end ...

Permalink",False,"Review: This is an extremely deep drama about a happily married woman who is suffering with a rear trait of Alzheimers. She is a promising professor who is very witty and very intelligent but as the disease grows, she starts to lose her sharp wit along with her memory, which takes it toll on her tight family life. Her husband is going through an important time at work so he has to devote a lot of his time, going back and forth to various locations to sort out his business. One of her 3 children is heavily pregnant while her youngest daughter is a struggling actor in Los Angeles so she relies on her phone to test how much she can remember. After a while her memory really does decline so the family members come together to help take care of her. This movie really did touch me because I suffered with memory lose after suffering with a severe brain tumour. The acting was superb from Moore and Baldwin and the chemistry between the characters was believable and pretty emotional. There isn't much that you can do with someone who is suffering with this disease because it matters a lot, on the patients memory on a day to day basis so I really felt for the main character who tried her utmost to remember the key things in her life. Personally, I'm surprised that the family didn't show more emotion towards there mother who was finding it hard to cope with her condition but thats just my opinion. Anyway, this is a right tear-jerker so make sure you have a box of tissues next to you while your watching this film. Emotional! 

Round-Up: I'm really not surprised that Julianne Moore won an Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA for this role because you can tell that she really did give it her all. After starring in massive movies like the Hunger Games franchise, Non-Stop, Eagle Eye and Magnolia, she has finally got what she deserves with such a touching movie about a disease that affects the young as well as the old. She really hasn't stopped working since her role in the Hand That Rocks The Cradle in 1992 and at 54 years old and with another Hunger Games in the pipeline, it really doesn't seem like she's going to be slowing down any time soon. Alec Baldwin is one of my favourite actors because he has a real natural approach to all of his roles. He really doesn't seem like he's acting half of the time and he has a great sense of humour off screen as well. With over 100 movies in his portfolio and a role in the new Mission Impossible movie, I really do think it's about time that he wins some of the big awards. The directors of this film, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, haven't really made any major movies in there careers so I'm surprised that they were trusted with such a delicate subject matter. They really done a good job and they got the most out of a great cast. I'm glad that they have brought this disease to light because I personally don't think that it is talked about enough. 

Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $42million

I recommend this movie to people who are into their emotional dramas about a brilliant, accomplished professor who has been diagnosed Alzheimers. 6/10"

Permalink",False,"I watched this movie just because of Julianne Moore. It was worth watching. Not just because of her, but also the story is great.

The story is telling us the life of Alice Howland, a very good linguistics professor and smart. Her life, career and family are wonderful. Her life takes a turning point when she is diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. In the beginning she starts to forget names and small details, but later her condition gets worse. Being a person with a bright mind, Alice suffers even more.

I'm a fan of these kind of Dramas. It has such wonderful moments, touching at the same time. Julian Moore's performance was her's best. I loved her inspirational speech at the Annual Dementia Care Conference.

I also appreciate Kristen Stewart's courage to play next to Julianne Moore.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice is an aching portrayal of how a lifetime disease completely destroys the life of a person and tests the people around. Alice (Julianne Moore) is highly successful linguistic professor who is intelligent and loving. She has recently turned 50 and is married to John (Alec Baldwin) and has three children. When Alice is diagnosed with early onset of Alzheimer's which is rare at her age, the family is left devastated. Moreover the form of the disease is rare and also genetically inheritable. Alzheimer's disease slowly degrades the functionalities of victim's brain, if you don't know. At start, Alice can't remember a difficult word during one of her linguistics lecture but towards the end she cant even remember who she is or her family. Still Alice captures this transformation subtly and its an emotional experience. Whatever happens Alice remains as strong as possible and faces the problems with support of her family. Definitely the biggest credit goes to Julianne Moore, whose performance was pivotal in connecting with Alice. She very well deserved her first Oscar. The scene where Alice gives a speech to other Alzheimer's patients was touching and motivating. Also Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart were notably good as ever supportive husband of Alice and her youngest child Lydia. Alice and Lydia have a kind of special bond and the film exploits it very nicely. The soundtrack was gentle and soulfully good plus the cinematography was beautiful. But I felt the story missed many opportunities to strike the chords harder and was predictable many times. Would have been better I feel if more screen time was provided to rest of the family (esp. the children). Anyways, Still Alice stays strongly focused on Alice and boosted by a memorable performance by Julianne Moore it becomes am immersing experience. Its sad, heartbreaking and human. If you don't have much idea about Alzheimer's disease I suggest you must not miss this one!

RATING: [3.5/5]"

Permalink",False,"This movie to me plays hard on the emotions of an almost perfect woman who has everything at the tip of her fingers. Great family,power-house career,a beautiful mind but lost it bit by bit right in front of her own eyes. It shows slowly yet painfully how that perfect life she has built crumbles and effects everyone around her. Also shows self-acceptance to the disease and how people around are very supportive of it. Family ties bond and break, friends come and go. The emotions played by all actors significantly Julianne Moore was awesome and i have to say, it made an impact on me. A must see if you are into family-like-drama movies & also a sip of humanity. It was a great journey to be part of.

Permalink",True,"I LOVED this film, Julianne Moore and Alex Baldwin in it. It completely emotionally covered me and I cried much. Many, I am sure, who see this film have had at least some experience with neurological diseases like Alzheimer's or something else. My own family has suffered with that and more.

I thought the film reminds us what truly is important in life and that it is about love, as Alice, so compromised by the erasure of her personality by the disease, still in the end, saw! Julianne Moore is incredible but this film may not be for everyone unless you can see the realities of life played out without wanting to hide under the covers that will not, in the end, save anyone. I watched the movie in segments because it saddened me so but I believe it is necessary to see the sad of life to appreciate the happy of it as well.

What a wonderful film ""Still Alice"" is. T'were the trillions wasted on killing humans in endless wars of stupidity instead were spent on the research and treatment of nature's mistakes that could save many of us from an unacceptable fate.

The why of it all has always eluded me but we go on nonetheless, I believe, to fight for humane and just causes with the hope our one little life can mean something good for those who follow.

Permalink",False,"""Still Alice"" is a pretty good but sad film about a college professor who is diagnosed with a rare condition that affects her and her family's lives. The film shows how the disease comes between each individual in the family and pits some of them against one another but at the same time brings them together, all the while Alice, played by Julianne Moore, prepares for what she finds out is the inevitable. Some critics and users gave this film a bad review but with the outstanding performances by Julianne Moore and Kristen Stewart this film almost couldn't help but be an Academy Award nominee, at least. As usual Julianne Moore delivered a wonder performance as her role of Alice and Kristen Stewart's almost inability to smile made her perfect for the role as Lydia because it caused her demeanor to look as if she didn't care for her mother in the latter days of her illness when she really did care. The critics and users who gave this film bad reviews were probably looking for something else and not really focused on what this disease is about. Even besides that, this film was over all a good one to watch. Anyone who has ever had to care for someone with this condition can probably relate to this film but it was weird to see a person succumb to this disease at a young age. That's really what made it so sad."

Permalink",True,"If I could give this movie an 11 I would in a flash. When someone 'old' gets Alzheimer Disease (or any disease really) there are sighs and utterances of 'at least they had a long life.' When someone young becomes unwell we weep and cry out for what they do not have and may never have. However, the relatively 'young', relative to the illness, often get forgotten. The few are too few to shout from the mountaintops about the injustice of it. In Alzheimer's anyone under the age of say 65 is young and the hereditary EFAD (Early onset Familial Alzheimer Disease) is rare. It takes courage to bet on a movie about real things that few take notice of or just don't know it exists. In this case, however, I think the star power will get people in but the story will hauntingly hold them forever. If you haven't seen it... see it. If you've seen it... keep that memory.

Permalink",True,"I can't say enough about this movie. This movie hit home for my family in the best way possible. Nobody except Sony would even think about putting the entire movie through the lens of the patient. Julianne Moore's enigmatic performance is unparalleled in this film.

Even though she was given an a-list cast in Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart and Kate Bosworth to film with, she could have easily carried the entire movie by herself. The entire movie is emotionally intense with a depressing - yet uplifting - undertone to it.

The fact that this movie digs in deep with a modern accent and original challenges of Alzheimer's, this movie produces a very unique style all its own. The way Alice keeps trying to hold onto her memory, from self-recordings to default questions in her phone, you can feel her pain and anguish as she slowly - and literally - loses her mind.

By the end of the movie Alice has completely forgotten everything, barely being able to speak. Her daughter Lydia (Stewart) read a very intriguing and interesting story to her, and then tried to ask her what it was about. And she uttered the one word she always knew: love. ""Yeah, Mom. It was about love."" This film is one of a kind. Anybody struggling with the disease, or who knows someone who is, should watch this movie. It could have ended better than it did, but it also gives us hope, showing us that anything can happen. A definite 10 out of 10.

Permalink",False,"Superb performance of Julianne Moore who is remarkable in the role of a linguistics professor who learns she has an early form of Alzheimer. Honesty, sensibility, precision and respect: she deserves the Oscar.

The character of Alice is impressive, a great example of bravery even though we can see terror, fear and guilt in her eyes. At every stage of this degenerative disease she keeps fighting, she struggles trying not to forget the words and the memories composing the world she spent years building. But she is more and more disconnected and accepts this inevitable decline and loss with dignity. She is still Alice, and her family will remember her as the strong and brilliant woman she once was, even though they are collateral victims.

This movie is heartbreaking but not a melodrama with beautiful and moving moments.

I have to say that although this is a very, very good movie with great acting it is also one of the most depressing movies I have seen in a while. This is defiantly one to not miss, but it is a film you can really only watch once. The performance is heartbreaking and really shows why Moore is one of the top actresses today. This a a movie where words can't do it justice, just watch this and take in the performance of Julianne Moore. Overall, a great performance in a very good movie. I recommend this for the performance alone. I did however think the movie Barney's Version was better. I give this an A-.

Permalink",False,"Still Alice

The hardest part of losing your memory is trying to remember the hardest part of losing your memory.

That is why the sufferer in this drama records her thoughts for posterity.

Alice (Julianne Moore) is a middle-aged linguistics professor who suddenly starts experiencing lapses in her thought process.

She later learns that she has a rare form of Alzheimer's, and that one of her three grown children: Lydia (Kristen Stewart), Anna (Kate Bosworth) and Tom (Hunter Parrish) is likely to have inherited it from her.

As Alice's health deteriorates, her husband (Alec Baldwin) fades into the background as Lydia steps into a more motherly role.

Powerful and poignant, this well-acted adaptation of the best-seller perfectly captures the deliberate decline in mental and cognitive skills associated with the disease, as well as the toll Alzheimer's takes on your family.

On the upside, Alzheimer's does help you forget you have cancer.

Permalink",True,"If it was just for Julianne Moore, this movie would be rated between 8 and 9 on this forum. The storyline, the progression and the distress are very well illustrated by the lead actress. Moore is one of the best actresses of her generation and she shows it here with a less than supporting cast. But the presence of Kristen Stewart is a blunder. Her delivery is sometimes inaudible as she mumbles her sentences like a spoiled teenager in front of a laptop playing a video game. But I have seen other reviewers say that this was not her worst performance. I will carefully avoid watching anything were she is part of the cast. This means she has no business acting. The only other actresses who are so incapable are Lyndsay Lohan and Shawnee Smith.It is scandalizing to see that such an important script was spoiled by her presence (if we can call it that). The movie is in many ways similar to Regarding Henry (1991) with the difference that the later was properly cast. (It is a mystery to see it rated at 6,7).

We view her despair and that of the family as the illness takes hold and allows for a once vital woman's descending into a rapid decline.

Don't under-estimate the performance of Alec Baldwin here. He is great as the husband, first in denial who comes to grips with what is occurring and must ultimately make a grave decision.

We see the various symptoms and stages of this horrible illness. We see the neurologist working with Alice, determined to give her a quality of life for as long as possible.

Of course, we see how the illness affects the human relations within the family.

Permalink",False,"There are so many illnesses and diseases that exist in the world today that just don't have a cure, no matter how many fund raisers we donate to or telethons we listen to, there never seems to be any change in the world or in the diseases and illnesses that they are working towards find a cure for. For me I've only ever known one person who had Alzheimer's they were very late in their age and always said they had had a good life. When she passed though everyone's response was ""she's better off"" personally I always had a problem with that sentiment. It's not like Hallmark make cards saying such things, so why would people believe that ""they're better off"" can be consoling in any possible way. I guess we as individuals deal with such things in our own unique way and this film will definitely have you thinking about yourself and your own little quirks and what ifs by the time credits run. Alice is sitting at a table celebrating her 50th birthday with her three children and husband, Alice is a linguistics lecturer at the local university, she keeps not only her mind fit by solving problems and playing word games but also her body by jogging about the campus on a regular basis. One day during a presentation Alice forgets a word, she thinks nothing of it until later when she is out jogging and gets lost about the campus unable to find her way back home. Alice goes to see her GP who refers her to a neurologist where she is told she has Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease. Alice of course can't believe the news but goes about telling her husband and children of her illness, she must also tell her family that the disease is actually hereditary and passed down through the mother so the kids must be checked as well. Two of the children take the test the third child refuses. As the film progresses the harshness and reality of what a day to day struggle living with the disease becomes very heartbreaking. Alice sets up some questions on her phone whilst still able to comprehend her surroundings; she makes a video directing her to take some drastic action when the day comes that she can no longer answer any of the questions The one thing that really works for this film is its simplicity in the way the story of Alice is told, everyone involved has done a wonderful job bringing the hardships and heartache that Alzheimer's brings forth. Julianne Moore (Seventh Son, Children of Men) is amazing as Alice Howland, I don't think anyone out there could have done any better, and finally the lady got the award she should have been awarded a very long time ago delivered to her due to the outstanding character she created and her amazing skills as a talented actor. Starring alongside her is Alec Baldwin (30 Rock, Rock of Ages) as her husband John Howland, Kate Bosworth (Superman Returns, Before I Wake) as Alice's eldest daughter Anna Howland- Jones, Hunter Parrish (Weeds, 17 Again) as Alice's middle child Tom Howland, and most surprising in her role Kristen Stewart (Twilight Saga, Jumper) as the black sheep of the family Lydia Howland, she did shock me a little especially as she has never been a personal favourite of mine, she stepped up to the mark quite well in her role. Directed by both Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland (The Fluffer, The Last of Robin Hood) both guys working together have made something that could have been extremely difficult to pull off yet they have made it seem much easier in their final delivery. I did find it very slow in places which in turn made the film feel quite long but worse than that it took away a lot of the emotion I was supposed to be feeling as well. Don't misunderstand me here; the film is a tear jerker especially for those of us that replace the actors with ourselves and our own life situations. The first time I watched this film there was one scene early on that had me blubbering like a baby, just at the helplessness poor Alice was going through, I in-turn put myself in her place which made it far worse. Still Alice is a film that deserves more recognition than it has received so far, it is a film that will tear down your walls and make you fear not only your own life but that of all your nearest and dearest as well. Not a family friendly film as the young ones will get very easily bored I feel and tear your attention away"

STILL ALICE is a carefully constructed Whodunnit. Julianne Moore plays Alice, a Columbia University professor incapacitated by genetically-inherited Early-Onset Alzheimer's. This makes Alice akin to the proverbial ""canary in the coal mine."" What ""triggers"" or activates her fatal gene? Alice's doctor says that this gene is 100% fatal (assuming that LOGAN'S RUN rules--in which everyone is Euthanized on their 30th birthday--are not in effect, of course). But nearly 100% of Americans drink alcohol, too. Alice's dad, who foisted off this gene defect upon her, was an alcoholic. Pre-onset, Alice is shown drinking like a fish. Has anyone thought to check if ""tea-totalers"" or Mormons can catch Alzheimer's? If they do, are their cases as severe as those of comparable drinkers? President Reagan drank in the Oval Office.

Permalink",False,"Quickie Review:

Alice (Julianne Moore) is a linguistics professor, highly respected for her intellect. However everything she valued most about herself is threatened when she is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Both Alice and her family struggle together to fight the disease as it slowly progresses and starts to take its toll. Still Alice, is a tragic tale brought to life by a great ensemble cast the gem of which is Julianne Moore. A truly emotional drama that does justice to the real people and families who have suffered through such diseases.

Full Review:

Of course, thanks to the international release schedule I only just watched this movie. I already knew that Julianne Moore won the Oscar for her performance. So I was curious to see if she meets that caliber. She absolutely does.

What I liked about Moore's performance is that it felt authentic. It was never over the top, desperately trying to grab your attention. The subtlety in her acting makes you empathize with her. As a result the character Alice is very relatable and so you want the best for her. Even when she has some questionable reactions on how to fix her problems, you understand her reasoning. Another impressive aspect is how well Moore shows the phases of the disease progression. Alzheimer's disease is not a sudden occurrence and the symptoms are not always obvious. Throughout the movie you see little glimpses and changes in Alice's behavior. All of which add to believability of the extreme hardships of the characters involved.

I have been praising Moore so far, but I must mention the supporting cast who were critical to the story. Still Alice is not just about Alice, it is also about her family and how they are dealing with the diagnosis. I can't believe I am saying this but Kristen Stewart playing Alice's daughter was actually good in this movie. Yes, I'm talking about Bella of the Twilight and Snow White & The Huntsman fame. Who knew right? The character of Alec Baldwin, the husband, was quite refreshing. All too often Hollywood is filled with movies about failed marriages and infidelities. I guess that has conditioned me to expect Baldwin's character to try to escape the marriage. Instead I appreciated seeing an actually supportive husband. Of course there are moments of weakness, where he is not sure what to do or how to help, but I doubt anyone in that situation would be confident 100% of the time.

The key to success for this movie is realism: realistic characters, relationships, and hardships. The realism on top of the stellar performance by Julianne Moore and solid supporting cast makes Still Alice a justly inspirational film. Now I understand and support the decision to give Moore the Oscar. This is why we forgive her for Seventh Son. I'd be shocked if anyone isn't moved by Still Alice.

I would strongly recommend that you see this film, especially if you have someone ill in the family.

Permalink",False,"I was in the cinema to watch 'Still Alice' with my friend this Wednesday. A movie I was looking forward to see, especially now that Julianne Moore won both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for Best Actress.

Maybe I'm a little biased because I I'm working in a nursing home for people with dementia, so this film was already very close to my heart. 'Still Alice' is based on the book by Lisa Genova. The book has the same title as the movie, and I know many of my colleagues has read this book. However, I have never heard of the book before recently. My colleagues have spoken very positively about the book, so I already had some expectations for the film.

I was very touched by this film! I think it showed in a totally brilliant way how Alzheimer's affects both the person and the relatives. Alzheimer's is well known as The Relatives Disease, since the person who gets hit, will in time not be aware of their own situation. But before the person comes so far, there is a long process of despair, frustration, anxiety, grief and acceptance, the person must go through. It is a very common disease and I think the movie really gave an insight into this process, as both the person and the relatives are going through.

Julianne Moore gave a very credible performance as Alice Howland. Her two statuettes are well deserved!

I recommend 'Still Alice' to all who want a little insight into Alzheimer's and for people who want to watch a touching tale

I give 'Still Alice' 6 out of 10 stars"

Permalink",False,"What must it be like to realize that you no longer connect to the world around you; that one's footing is untethered? That everything is unknowable, but yet has a tinge of familiarity. The present is a labyrinth of disassociation; we are floating in an ether where we futilely shadow box to gain mastery of the seemingly simple task of being oneself. STILL ALICE attempts very straightforwardly to depict the mesmerizingly desolate story of Dr. Alice Howland - a renowned Professor of Linguistics at Columbia University - whose field of study deals with words and communication - and the ironic turn her life takes, as she realizes that she is slowly losing the ability to access the power of language and memory - the underpinnings of books, years of study and exploration are now desperately failing her. Alice at the age of 50 has been diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer's disease.

A beautiful performance by Julianne Moore as Alice - a woman, heroic in her efforts to create strategies to navigate the abyss. Alice is a warrior in a fight she knows is un-winnable; filaments of who she was, and who she is slowly becoming to her family and professional colleagues, exist at the core of this daunting drama. What makes this film so personally harrowing is the fact that we all can empathize with the possibility of being in a similar situation sometime in the future and even in the present. Those moments when a name slips away from our tongue and gets knotted up in our brain refusing to reveal itself; when we blindly stare at the computer and wonder what is this blank slate we are so intently gazing at; or finding oneself in the middle of a street momentarily wondering how we got there and in which direction should we transverse.

Alice never becomes an ""empty vessel."" There are remnants of what is ""still Alice."" Expressions of a parent's love, compassion, as well as past familial conflicts are never entirely erased; glimpses of the poetry of longing and physical touch come to light to surprise those who thought Alice had all but disappeared into the void. A searing honesty that refuses to cover up the truth of her situation prevents this movie from being insipidly maudlin, and reinforces the admiration we feel for this courageous woman who is valiantly fighting to preserve her mind from oblivion."

The screenplay was awesome and the acting of Julianne, Kristen and Alec was stupendous. Julianne showed a splendid performance by putting herself perfectly into the shoes of an Alzheimer's patient, the tragic surprise she got when she was diagnosed and keeping herself together and acting brave during every appointment with her neurologist and especially when she delivered the speech which my most favorite part of the movie. Julianne family was a wonderful support system especially her husband who put her with her very patiently. What i loved most about the character of Alice was that till the end she didn't give up and kept her word of not suffering but struggling no matter what. When i was watching the end of the movie, the poem ""The Seven Ages of Man"" came in my mind, life is a full cycle, just like a baby who is introduce to the world of words for communication, at old age it is the same but it is more upsetting with Alzheimer's patients.

I found the story unravelling in what I found to be a fairly clichéd and formulaic way and everything that I thought would happen pretty much did and there was not a whole lot of surprises and I figured the other hour, or so of the film would be an unpleasant experience seeing as the first half hour, or so was really doing nothing for me. Something changed however. I do not know if it was the film itself, or I just grew more patient and tolerant of it, but regardless after that first half hour, I started to like the film, a lot in fact. What once seemed like a fairly typical and by the books type of storytelling started to grow on me and I grew to appreciate the character of Alice, and everything she was going through with her health battles, but I could also empathize with her and her family members during this time. I think part of my original problem was that in the first half hour of the film, everything just seemed to be happening so fast and I felt there was not enough build up or examination of the characters or their lives, so it was therefore hard to connect to them and the situation they were going through. Thankfully the rest of the film gave plenty of time to witness Julianne Moore's excellent acting as she gave an incredibly powerful, moving and yet believable portrayal of someone who has Alzheimer's Disease. You could see through the film the different emotions and frustrations that come about for Alice, and her family because of this. Feelings of anger, confusion, sadness, hopelessness and yet at the same time the film has a determined spirit because we see how much Alice, as a person wants to fight this disease and how her family accommodates everything for her and tries to make it all comfortable and to be of the utmost help and support to her. Julianne Moore's Oscar winning performance certainly is a great one as you see her fiery determination as well as going through all the other emotions and feelings that I mentioned above. It is a believable performance and also one as a viewer that you care deeply about. I found that in this film that all the supporting performances were all very good here as well. I have not seen Kristen Stewart in a lot of films (the Twilight series is definitely not something I want to tackle), but I found her to be really good here as Alice's sort of estranged daughter and just how her character is one of the biggest helps to her mother and yet how they grow together both in maturity and understanding of life and each other was really something rewarding to watch. It's a subtle and low key performance that feels very natural and real and I think it works perfectly. Also as I said, everyone else here all does a very good job also. The film successfully takes a subject that could have been sappy, or melodramatic as my first concerns for the film were and makes it a joy to watch because of the strong performances as well as writing that helps us to empathize and connect with these characters as well as giving us a subject matter that is something we can all connect with. No, we will not all get Alzheimer's Disease one day, but yet each of us faces the sometimes extremely challenging and difficult situation of growing older and dealing with various health problems and concerns, whether it be for ourselves, or someone that we love and is close to us. Unfortunately it is something we will all face one day and while it can be scary there is optimism we see throughout the film of Still Alice, about being together as a family and supporting one another and just not giving up on yourself, or each other no matter how difficult, or painful the situation may be. This film shows the trials and difficulties of illness, but also how it brings people together in moments of love and strength. I am so glad that I stuck with this film and that my early first perceptions of it changed because it was certainly a movie worth seeing and I am glad that I did. I think this is a film that will appeal to a large amount of people because of the excellent acting and believable and relatable subject matter. I can definitely see why Julianne Moore won an Oscar for this and I recommend the film highly and consider it to be one of the most thoughtful and yet respectful films of last year and one that needs to be seen and then talked about afterwards. One of 2014's best films."

Permalink",False,"The best thing about Still Alice is that it is told in the most appropriate way it could've been told: a subtle way.

Alice (Moore), a middle-aged Linguistics professor, struggles as she finds out that she has initial onset Alzheimer's and that it is a hereditary condition, leading her to worry for her kids and future grandkids. After informatively depicting the onset and the unsuspecting initial tick that we as an audience could guess right for Alice's future medical state, the film chronicles her hardships and the tearing relationship with her family.

Moore's character is well-written as she incredibly captures the fears of plunging into a dark future, oblivion, and eventual death. Also, the film is different because of the pragmatism that is shows through the character, which seems to us like the best thing one can do in a situation like this. When Alice fails to carry out the basic, mundane chores, it breaks our hearts.

Although, after the point is made and the effects displayed on a large scope, the screenplay itself struggles, and starts to drag - like it has to fully use the two-hour window given by the producers - which slightly induces boredom, even if you are the empathizing type. But, wait for the final haunting sequence, and you will get the wind of the whole tragic story of a brilliant human being. It does point to the fact that how geniuses end up in the abysses of life due to diseases like the Alzheimer's.

Moore is very good, as is proved with the Oscar. Baldwin looked alert all the time, but I loved his character. The problem with Stewart is that she can act, but her facial structure makes us into believing that she cannot; she is good, anyway.

BOTTOM LINE: With a subtle narrative and easy music, this one is a finely made film about a tragedy. Not much can be expressed about the film in words; you will have to watch it to feel it. Recommended!

Can be watched with a typical Indian family?"

Permalink",False,"With all the news about Alzheimers disease, this is a timely movie that is very well done. Julianne Moore certainly deserves the Academy Award she won for her role in this film. It is somewhat depressing, because as of the resent time, there is still no cure to the disease, but the way it was portrayed in the film seems so realistic. I think it would have been easy to carry the victims emotions over-the-top, but Julianne was almost understated in keeping things on an even keel. Top notch acting by all the supporting cast also adds to the film. So refreshing to see an intelligent and thought provoking film instead of the usual bang-bang, shoot-em up or racing cars.

Permalink",False,"""Movies are mechanisms of empathy,"" Roger Ebert didn't quite say.

But this reviewer prefers the misquoted diction (provided by Anderson Cowan of The Film Vault.)

When one asks, ""Why watch Still Alice when it's only going to depress me?""

There's only one legitimate response.

""It's a mechanism of empathy, dawg.""

Channeling an experiential river flow, the narrative spins the neurological waterwheel.

Did I want to watch Still Al? No.

Am I a smarter/better person following the experience? Absolutely.

The purely objective form of personal growth? The viewer's exponentially more fluent in the Alzheimer's realm of modern medicine.

The subjective forms? For one: The priceless merit of seeing a well-crafted, timely motion picture.

Two: If your torso's peppered with shurikens, I'd hope it wouldn't come as a complete surprise.

Likewise, if my demise arrives on a tidal wave of death stars, what's to stop me from running around in a circle and screaming obscenities until the official end?

Maximizing (rather than minimizing) the agony of my unexpected affliction.

Catch my drift, proverbial reader?

Still Alice is profoundly sad, but not 'depressing.'

'Depressing' connotes a residual effect; a lasting (potentially irrevocable) alteration of your emotional state.

I discourage this aversion toward cinematic tragedy. My top three films of all time (Platoon, Raging Bull and Schindler's List) belong in the downer category.

Tragedy often spotlights hidden profundities.

Still Alice is a heartwarming narrative obscured by the haze of Early Onset Alzheimer's, a rare form of the disease. Symptoms typically begin showing in the early fifties.

At that precise moment, the viewer meets Alice and her family.

It's tough, folks.

No sugarcoating it.

Expect to weep. More than once.

On a high note, it's well shot, directed and edited. The writing's crisp; the drama's chilly and real.

Lead by an outstanding performance from one of the best actresses ever, Julianne Moore, the entire cast is fantastic.

Alec Baldwin's excellence in a major supporting role comes as no surprise.

What (perhaps) defies expectation is an equally terrific piece of acting from Kristen Stewart.

This reviewer hopped aboard Kristen's locomotive after Snow White and The Huntsman. That gal's gotten a bum rap, despite some serious acting chops.

Anyhow. For an educational and moving experience, check out Still Alice.

It's a top quality flick, featuring quality performances from a tight (but stellar) cast.

Should one find oneself sobbing mid-theater, cursing a favorite film reviewer's name, try to remind oneself:

""It's a mechanism of empathy, dawg.""

Feel that cognitive waterwheel aturnin'."

Permalink",False,"Julianne Moore. There are stretches of this film, one shot in particular early on when we first see her character, Alice, at the neurologist being asked the questions that will be asked of her again, where the camera just rests on her. Why move anywhere else anyhow? It's her story, it's her who has to command our attention for so long, and damn if Moore isn't, per usual, up to the task. Even in the films of hers that aren't quite up to par, she always shows up ready to take on the character at heart and find a way to get into it and make the person come alive. Like a film that broke her out in the indie scene, 1995's Safe, her character here is afflicted by something that is making her unable to function - to her husband, to her kids, to those around her. But where that was a film that functioned as a social satire in many respects, here it's a dark, highly emotionally charged character piece. I have to wonder if Ingmar Bergman had a script lying around at some point with the tenor of this.

Is it up to those kinds of lofty mega-high-art standards? Maybe not. But to even bring him up should be an indicator of the quality of the work here. The filmmakers treat this novel with total sincerity, and make the story of this woman's slow but sure disintegration not so much a 'message' piece (though there is a speech that spells out, without ambiguity, how horrible this sort of disease Alzheimer's is, and with little cure, just alleviation of certain symptoms) but all about the characters. Who can Alice rely on? Her husband (Alec Baldwin, very game and emotionally open completely for this guy), her kids (Kristen Stewart, showing she can certainly act, and Kate Bosworth, who is fine, and a couple other actors who are okay but just there without that much dimension), and maybe her doctor, who can only do so much.

There is a dramatic device, to be sure (a video, won't say what's on it, but it's meant to be a 'fail-safe' option for living in a manner of speaking). But mostly, this is Moore's show. The camera stays on her for much of the time, and the directors are intelligent about expressing visually the scope of this illness: many times, often times, when Alice is in a fog, we can see her fine, but everything else around her is in a blur. When she first really gets a full sign of this trouble ahead, she's jogging and loses sight or consciousness of where she is. It's a terrifying moment, and the filmmakers get that superbly. The musical score may be melodramatic to a degree - other times, in the scenes where Alice just has trouble remembering what room she's in or what to do in a moment, it works better - but the filmmakers keep it in check.

Again, if you like Julianne Moore, you'll like this movie. It's hard to look past that, and she gives her complete pathos and dimension, and a full sense of tragedy. Alice may have lived a full life, a family, wonderful career, but when it's slipping away and she's always there to see it AND can recognize that it's slipping away from time to time, the tragedy envelops everything around it. Moore doesn't let the character slip into any false notes, not for a moment, and that's the key to the film's success. Still Alice could, in lessor hands, be mawkish, Hallmark material. These directors (one of whom, shockingly, had ALS while directing the film) trust the inherent harrowing nature of this debilitating disease, and the honesty of the character's depiction shines through the most."

Permalink",False,"Greetings again from the darkness. I've never understood the phrase ""cruel disease"". Are there diseases that aren't cruel? One could say the level of cruelty is determined by how the disease affects you and your loved ones, but a stunning performance by Julianne Moore provides a glimpse of what Alzheimer's does to those afflicted. She shows us what it's like when we are robbed of what makes us who we are. And yes, it's very cruel.

Most ""disease"" movies spend a significant amount of effort demonstrating how this will affect the victim's family and friends, but co-directors Richard Glazer and Wash Westmoreland have adapted Lisa Genova's novel to focus on Alice (Ms. Moore)  her family is mostly trotted out to help the viewer understand how the disease has progressed. We first meet Alice on her 50th birthday, and soon learn she is a brilliant Linguistics Professor at Columbia and has 3 brilliant kids (Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish) and a brilliant husband (Alec Baldwin). These are brilliant, successful and beautiful people. And that's one of the points here  Alzheimer's doesn't pick on the poor, the slow or the weak. It doesn't discriminate at all (other than a slightly higher rate amongst women).

Julianne Moore somehow is equally effective as the energetic, very confident professor and the shell of a person with vacant eyes who only periodically recognizes the face in the mirror or the faces at the family meal. This is a movie and a performance about moments  moments of panic, isolation, and one particular moment of unleashed emotion when Alice comes clean to her husband early on. We hear the fading of her verbal skills (in her speeches) and we witness the slow fail of her body (she was once a runner). It's torturous to hear and see.

There have been other movies that touched on Alzheimer's: The Notebook (2004), The Savages (2007), and Away From Her (2007), but Julianne Moore is the first to take us inside, to force us to feel the slow loss of self. It's painful, and yes it's cruel."

Permalink",False,"All movies should be entertaining, but the best ones are also educational, or thought-provoking, or at least able to reach us on some emotional level. When a movie can do all of these things, then it has realized the potential of the medium. This is the case with ""Still Alice"" (PG-13, 1:41).

Dr. Alice Howland is a brilliant college professor in the field of linguistics at Columbia University. When she starts having unexplained memory lapses, she begins seeing a neurologist. After a number of medical tests and memory tests, she receives the devastating diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer's disease. She's barely 50 years old. We now see the tragic irony of a linguistics specialist beginning to lose her command of language. It's terrible for her, and for her family as well. Her college professor husband (Alec Baldwin), her eldest daughter (Kate Bosworth), who is having trouble conceiving a child with her husband, her younger daughter (Kristen Stewart), who is living in L.A. and trying to make it as an actress and her son (Hunter Parrish) are all as supportive as they can be, but there's only so much they can do. This disease is gradually robbing Dr. Howland of her memory and will eventually rob her of her identity, but she fights, as long as she can, to remain still Alice.

What may sound like a rote, depressing and overly sentimental story manages to avoid falling into any of those traps. To keep the story from becoming a mediocre ""Lifetime"" movie, writer-directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland (adapting the book of the same title by Lisa Genova), inject a couple unexpected plot points which really add to the story, but don't feel forced. The movie is only as emotional as it has to be to fairly and realistically portray such a story, but never becomes overly weepy or emotionally manipulative. As sad as the story is, the film includes moments of humor and incorporates other tonal variety to keep it from getting too depressing and brings the film to an end on just the right note. Moore's performance also does a lot to keep the film from becoming overly maudlin. She deserves all the awards she has won for so effectively bringing her considerable experience and skills as an actress to a very difficult role. All things considered, making a movie like this must have felt like walking a tight rope for all involved. What we get as a result of their efforts is an affecting, perfectly balanced drama about a very important topic. This is a film which both entertains and enlightens. ""A-"""

Permalink",False,"This was always going to be a tough watch. Not tough in that it was going to be a bad movie, tough in that the subject was never going to make for fun viewing. 'Still Alice' is about a very intelligent 50 year-old woman who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Try making a comedy out of that. Some sick, out-of-ideas filmmaker probably will someday but I assure you you won't want to see it. See 'Still Alice' instead, it deserves a watch.

It's a very well made film undoubtedly carried by Julianne Moore's brilliant performance which has been nominated for an Academy Award and is almost certain to win. She is raw and powerful in a number of scenes and directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland did a fantastic job of allowing her to shine, even to the extent of keeping the camera entirely focused on her face throughout the full length of a scene (which included another character doing a large portion of the speaking).

The key to making a film like this work is to make sure the characters that are being affected are both likable and also realistic. Moore is especially fantastic at this finding almost the perfect balance between the two whilst also showing the disease in its full effect. The dialogue is written beautifully and the final scene is really mind-blowing and an absolutely stunning way they chose to finish their film."

Julianne Moore gives a great performance, possibly the best of her career. It is no shock she is Oscar-nominated, and may even win. In fact, her performance completely carries the film (although Alec Baldwin is not half bad).

The film as a whole is average, and every scene with Kristen Stewart just ruins it. But Moore's greatness cancels out Stewart's inability to act, and we end up with a fairly decent film. Well worth watching, especially if you or someone you know has experienced Alzheimer's.

Permalink",False,"Julianne Moore plays a linguistics professor diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

The movie touched some of my sensitive nerves both because my grandmother died of this disease and because of my mother's tragic death half a year ago. It's a good movie, which shows some of the difficulties a person with this disease suffers, from his own perspective, and the effects it has on the family members. But it's not just about this specific disease - it's about losing a family member to any terminal disease (or losing a family member in general).

With such a topic, you know you shouldn't expect an easy film - and it's not. It has all the elements of a classic melodrama and - like with Alzheimer's disease - there are hardly any surprises in terms of what you're going to see, but it's done well. It's not a masterpiece and it doesn't cover all the aspects (nor the outcome of the stages) of the disease, but the elements are there, mainly good acting by Moore and the rest of the cast (although Kristen Stewart's way of acting is distracting, as always) and good writing.

This is a pretty difficult movie to watch. It's very sad and you should expect that. I'm glad I watched it, but I don't think I'll want to see it again any time soon because it's pretty close to me.

2014 is a very weak year for actresses. Looking at the list of Oscar nominees for both lead and supporting roles for actresses this year, I think Moore is well deserve of her nomination - and with such a weak competition she would probably add an Oscar to her Golden Globe. I'm so glad Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman turned down this role.

I changed my mind many times about whether to rate it a 6/10 or a 6.5/10. Finally, since this is one of the better movies I've seen dealing with Alzheimer's Disease, I decided to give it a 6.5/10, which makes it the second best movie of 2014 after ""Predestination"".

6.5/10 Highly recommended"

Permalink",True,"My Thoughts:

Still Alice is one of those movies that gets you thinking. In this case it gets you thinking about what would you do if you started to lose your memory and two what would you do if one of your family members started to lose theirs?

In the case of Still Alice, Alice played by Julianne Moore is a middle aged woman who has a great career and loving family when she starts to notice that she is forgetting things and gets diagnosed with early onset Familial Alzheimer Disease. So not only does Alice get hit with it she now has to let her family know that there is a good chance that they have the disease.

Its scary to think that one minute you have everything you want going for you and in the next you aren't going to remember most of your life. Julianne Moore gives us a beautiful performance of what it must be like to go through this terrible disease.

But what we also get in this movie is we are shown the different family members and how they deal with what is happening to their mother and wife. And we see how this puts them all under stress and how they deal with it. Some start off strong and are full of hope and help but lose it later down the line. While others are not there at the beginning but are there later on giving the strength that Alice and the rest of the family needs.

Everyone says they that will be there till the end but sometimes you can never be sure until you are put to the test and that is what this movie shows you. Even the strongest of us can falter.

My Recommendation:

Watch it on DVD
