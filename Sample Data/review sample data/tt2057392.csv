Permalink",False,"This movie was all of a sudden for me. ""GoodKill"" was the previous movie I saw which was made on the pilot behind the control's of the drones. But this took the movie to another level and did not let it stay stagnant.

I went into watching this movie with no idea, apart from the fact Aaron Paul and Helen Mirren are in it. It took me on a edge of the seat, nail biting suspense to understanding of all the decisions and effort that goes into putting a mission into effect.

If you wanna see a rare movie, shot splendidly, beautiful cast, perfect emotions and acting - this is a movie to watch. It might even crack your tears up if your so engrossed into the role these actors play in this movie.

One to watch, and I feel one to definitely own in Blue Ray.

Permalink",False,"This is a white-knuckled heart-parked-in-your-mouth ""tick tock"" suspense thriller. Hardly an ounce of fats lined a lean and mean explosive storyline, and this one is going to hit the ""career reset"" button for Gavin Hood (even though his last effort Ender's Game is quite decent).

Eye in the Sky towers above Good Kill (2015) on so many levels. They have the same story premise and both are spins on drone warfare, but their similarities end there. I really thought GK was a decent film albeit a tad too heavy on melodrama histrionics and it ultimately became top down heavy in its underlying message of modern warfare. EitS on the other hand is a complete marvel. It is exactly what GK isn't. It dares to ask probing ethical and moral questions but never cheapens the narrative by giving you broad-stroked answers; it will involve you totally and absolutely. We go through a minefield of moral conundrums and nobody will come out unscathed. The script is exceptionally probing and showcases all the legalistic, moralistic, ethical and political red-tape as parties, seated in situation rooms in different parts of the world (including a toilet), convened to decide whether a Hellfire missile should be launched. We see, almost in real time, the ramifications at every angle, from the innocent bystander, to the terrorists, to the people in suits and to the dude seated in a tiny room, his hands on the red trigger of a joystick. Innocence is indeed the first casualty of war.

Another reason this film shines is its refusal to go down certain genre tropes. You won't see the guy, who had squeezed the trigger to rain down destruction on collateral innocents, drown in alcohol and sucking in a line of coke. You won't see a woman going home to hug her toddler to reassure herself that she did the right thing. You won't see commanders giving you three-point sermons of ""it is a dirty job but somebody has to do it so that the world will be a better place"". There is such a raw and unsettling freshness to it. It may be a full-on talkie but I was gripping my arm-rests tightly and my wifey had her palms parked at her mouth, almost literally from the get-go.

The acting is all round immaculate. Helen Mirren shines as a hard-nosed military officer with a tiny soft spot for her underlings. Few actresses can elevate a film just with their presence; Mirren is one for the ages. This must be the best role I have seen Aaron Paul in since Breaking Bad. His role isn't easy, especially when he is stuck in a gamer's chair almost throughout the film. His face displays so much range that you would feel his internal turmoil as his omniscient eye calculates whether it will be a good kill. Barkhad Abdi, last seen as the baddie in Captain Phillips, has a superb turn as an operative on the ground, proving he is not a fluke. This is also Alan Rickman's final acting role and I literally count down the minutes that he will disappear from the big screen. The utterly memorable line he delivers with that quietly supercilious voice of his send chills down my spine. I am going to miss this fine actor.

Eye in the Sky is superbly cerebral and morally thought-provoking; a suspense thriller for intelligent people. It is impossible to come out of this 102-minute film and not have your soul shattered in some way. This is one of those films you shouldn't watch alone because you would immediately want to discuss with someone which side of the fence you would sit on and count the dire consequences. Is there even a right side?"

Permalink",False,"Not so long ago, all 'war movies' consisted of armies of infantry storming one beach/desert/jungle (delete as applicable). And, to be fair, there was little else that happened in a war. However, in today's high-tech times, 'war' can be fought from the 'comfort' of our own homes (okay, military bases, but how long before our soldiers are allowed to work from home?!). The story here goes that Britain has finally got the intel on a handful of its most wanted terrorists who are amassing in a house in a suburban African district. Should they just use an American-based 'drone' to wipe them out, or is the civilian casualty rate going to be too high? Helen Mirren thinks the former.

The cast boasts Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul on the cast list (and, of course the last performance of Alan Rickman), but it's Mirren who steals the show. She seems to revel in playing the British colonel who is willing to 'take out' the extremists at all costs. Aaron Paul isn't in it as much as some people may hope, but does well with what he's given (which is basically spending the whole film sitting in a chair!). Alan Rickman is as awesome as ever and it's a shame we've lost him too early. Plus we do see what's happening 'on the ground' as it were and the film's unsung hero is a Somalian operative who seems to give a performance filled with more heart and feeling without uttering a word of English than most English-speaking actors.

If you're hoping for an action-packed blast-a-thon of a movie then you'll be very disappointed here. Like I say, it's a war movie of our time. Some people may say that this is a fault, but basically the whole movie is people sitting around in offices debating the ethics of using technology in this way. The film is basically an 'ethics piece' which debates both sides of the argument. I have no problem with films like this, as long as they remain – reasonably – neutral and do their best to put both sides of the argument across. This one does this pretty well, however it does tend to lean towards 'nuking the site from obit' (ala Ellen Ripley) simply because its bigger stars seems to share the same opinion. However, there are plenty of moments where both sides of the argument make good points to support their opposing views.

This film won't be for everyone. Like I say, you have to be in the mood for something which is slow (but without being boring) and filled with messages (without being preachy). It does show how 'war' has evolved to a PR machine as much as something that is simply fought using a bigger army than your opponent. If you're up for something a little more thought-provoking then definitely give this one a go."

Permalink",False,"Unlike Good Kill, which is more focused on a drone pilot's life this movie is focused on a military joint operation between UK, US and Kenyan Forces against Al Shabab terrorists.

This movie is about ethical conundrum of drone attacks and killing innocent people in the process.

It's an intense film well acted and it really reflects how difficult it gets to give clearance for an attack when an innocent life gets in close proximity to a target.

There is a conflict between human ethics and achieving military objective.

Can 1 innocent life be sacrificed in order to save many? That's the question on which the whole movie revolves around.

Permalink",False,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) is drafted to military HQ, after intelligence confirms reports that a suicide bombing mission that could take out up to eighty people at a shopping mall is soon to go ahead in Nairobi, Kenya. The evidence is credible enough in her eyes, and those of her colleague Lieutenant General Benson (Alan Rickman) to launch an air strike on the terrorist plotters before they carry out their plan, but when a young girl sets up a bread stall around the target zone, American pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) finds himself compromised, and Colonel Powell is thrust into a complex situation where she has to take opinions down the chain of command.

In the modern age, with the terrorist threat level at severe, and attacks being thwarted around the globe almost daily, you have to wonder what's going on behind the scenes to keep us all safe, and hope that those responsible have the ability to make the right decisions, and don't abuse the position unnecessarily. But the thing you cannot forget is, they all are only human, and are in a position not many of us could handle. Eye in the Sky hones in on one such scenario, and gives us a riveting insight into the sort of situation that could unfold.

This is not some wistful, happy ever after tale, this is a depiction of the real life cost of war, and the film isn't afraid to lay bare the nitty gritty of real life tough decisions and the hard, brutal consequences they have. Director Gavin Hood manages to wrap us up in the situation as if it's happening right in front of us, and the result is a genuinely suspenseful, intelligent and unpredictable thriller of the sort you just never see as much of nowadays, where everything seems to be more about style than substance. There are no easy answers, and everyone is caught up in an unenviable place, where every reaction/outcome is morally complex, the result of being in such an impossible state of affairs.

Performances wise, in a role that its all too obvious would usually be played by a man, Mirren owns the lead role, displaying the sort of steely eyed, no nonsense grit that gives it such conviction regardless of gender, and in what we all now know was his last role, Rickman leaves us on a high note, delivering the sour, clear cutting persona we all knew him for, and so well. A supporting cast including Paul and a host of others offer dependable leverage.

This is one of the best, most rewarding and pleasantly surprising thrillers I've seen in a long time, and I'd urge you to see it. *****"

Permalink",False,"It surprised me quite a bit. Political war thrillers have been so overdone, but this one really managed to work by narrowing its scope. With films like this, and real-life disasters that kill dozens of people, it's easy to overlook the importance of every single human life. This film is aiming to remind us of just how significant, and atrocious, times of war are, and rightly so, the film does not come with any easy answers. I loved how the film was completely focused on one single event, and while I can see how some might think it was stretched out too much, I felt like moral and emotional weight of the situation on all of these characters called for it. Maybe I would say that the film gets a bit too sentimental at times (we don't need to be reminded with the many shots of the characters' faces or the music), but for the most part it really works. And oh Aaron Paul, you're just the perfect actor to play characters who are trying to help children.

Permalink",False,"Great movie that doesn't have to rely on tons of CGI to sustain interest. Instead, there is just a handful of characters, and they discuss about consequences. It's a discussion that won't happen in reality, of course, but the characters represent the different viewpoints in the drone killing process, and they do it very well. As another comment said: you have never seen a Skype call this gripping. This is great cinematography.

Had it just been a discussion about the moral ambiguity of drone strikes, the movie would not have convinced. Where the movie shines, IMO, is its portrayal of uncertainty. Reality cannot be manipulated, and can certainly not be taken for granted. The outcome is not decided in the discussion, but afterwards, and we have to face it. That can make you reluctant to act to the point of cowardice, or all gung-ho, but it doesn't make a difference in the end.

So, is there a happy ending? It doesn't matter. Live with the pain.

Explored through a complex ethical scenario, this work is illustrative of many important aspects of the process (such as moral sensitivity in military and government, moral reasoning, motivation, character, ...) as they are portrayed and examined through the decisions, judgements and actions of the various participants and stakeholders. This movie is very well paced and is supported by a stunning cast! The action scenes really make this into a thriller. Great to have Gavin Hood return to TIFF with this excellent work, ten years after ""Tsotsi"" made a splash here in Toronto!

Permalink",True,"This film has talented star power and an interesting premise, albeit this type of film has already been done, but where it fails is the inaction by Aaron's character and his unwillingness to follow orders. His actions challenge a direct order, and in real life scenario under these circumstances this would not happen.. he would be removed. It becomes a moral lecture on when it's right to take a life. The movie could easily have been a one hour show but it spends too much time debating and discussing the 'hit', all because a little girl is in danger. I mean, gimme a break... there are seriously bad people conspiring in the building in question and can be taken out with a accurate strike from the drone.

I'm not sure about others who saw this movie, but I was starting to squirm in my seat and mule out loud.. ""just press the damn button""!! The movie fails not because it isn't well acted or the story has no potential. It fails because it is unrealistic. The trigger man would not see one girl as sufficient collateral damage when many high risk targets are at stake, targets that have not been in one place for years!

If you like a movie that tries to show the sensitive and caring side of a young inexperienced man whose job it is to carry out orders from a group of senior experts who've dedicated their life to tracking these terrorists but is allowed to stall the decision at the risk of losing the shot by dithering over the possibility (they debate percentages of death ad nauseum) of a cute a little girl dying, then you'll like this movie. But I think most of us know the post 9/11 world we live in and how lucky the military would be to finally after years eliminate a number of known terrorists with one strike and not dedicate 45 minutes of a movie to hand-wringing and needless prevarication. It didn't make me yawn so much as make me angry... see it if you like, and tell me if you don't start pushing an imaginary button on your theater arm rest...

Permalink",False,"Director Gavin Hood's previous film, the underrated Ender's Game, focused upon the increasingly virtual, high-tech surveillance and disengaged nature of modern warfare. These elements of Ender's Game are clearly visible in the director's latest thriller offering, Eye in the Sky. The story here involves disparate groups of military and political personnel scattered around the world, all watching the live stream of a terrorist compound in Nairobi and debating whether or not to fire a drone into a heavily-populated ethnically Somali suburb of the Kenyan capital.

The operation is shown to be a joint British and American backed mission and the debate revolves around the collateral damage a drone strike would cause. The collateral damage is given a human face through a young girl who has set up a bread stall near the compound. Eye in the Sky's original title was ""Kill Chain"" and the reasoning becomes evident as the rest of the film involves people referring up the chain of command to avoid making a decision. The running time consists mainly of people talking to each other on phones and via video screens, however Hood manages to make these scenes some of the tensest, most cinematic, Skype calls you will ever see.

Eye in the Sky highlights the ""hawk"" and ""dove"" nature of the politicians of the two countries involved, one memorable scene being the US Secretary of State angry that his game of table tennis is interrupted because the British are dithering. However, the film's demonstration of realpolitik was weaker and has been presented far more successfully in Armando Iannucci's In the Loop, a film based on the run-up to the Iraq War. The film also lacked any strong, coherent argument against the drone strike apart from the contrived little girl selling bread nearby; not touching at all on the long-term consequences of dropping a bomb on a Somali suburb. The film reduces the complicated morality of drone warfare to a simplistic choice: it's either this little girl or a terrorist attack in a busy shopping mall. There's no concern however for civilians nearby who aren't cute children, or that the potential civilian casualties from this attack could be used by Al Shabab to garner more support amongst the population.

Alan Rickman is fantastically dry in his last on-screen role as a British Lieutenant General and Aaron Paul is also very impressive, despite spending the majority of the film in a Portacabin with his finger hovering over the trigger. But while Eye in the Sky may be one of the year's most gripping thrillers, the film's morality is more dubious rather than ambiguous."

They are front and center in a story about drones, war, decisions and heartache. This adult movie succeeds in spades in being a drama, a meditation on the mental and physical perils of war and the introduction of drones into our society. Aaron Paul and Barkhad Abdi (Captain Phillips) have small but significant roles as well. Easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. This movie is relevant in light of the increased violence we seem to wake up to each day. At its core it is about the juxtaposition of protecting citizens against evil in the world and evaluating the collateral damage which often comes with those decisions. It should give the compassionate viewer much to think about.

About the only really interesting thing was realizing the scope of the intelligence personnel and equipment in place all around the world and how quickly they can all communicate verbally and visually. The premise was simplistic and I guess some writer's idea of reiterating the unfortunate consequences of conflicts between nations and unforeseen casualties, as if we don't already know that. I was not the least bit upset about the mission going forth and feel it should have been accomplished the first time. I was downright ashamed of our lieutenant and his unmanly attitude. I feel this was a whiny, liberal diatribe intended to make us all feel guilty but it surely did not work on me.

Permalink",True,"Spoilers, but with this movie that's not an issue. I'll keep it short & sweet - don't waste your time watching this very mediocre film. The cast's talent is totally wasted on this failed effort of a movie. I was expecting to see technical details on drone operations and the actual prosecution of the kill chain. What I got was a boring hierarchical pass-the-buck up the political ladder story until a decision can be made to prosecute the target. The notion that one small child in the field of fire can delay that decision is totally stupid when in reality ""collateral damage"" is just part the war on terror. For the drone pilot-in-command to intervene is preposterous - he has very little authority in the decision At the risk of plugging the print media, there's an excelling book that provides an interesting account of how America got to where they are: Kill Chain - Drones and the Rise of High-Tech Assassins by Andrew Cockburn.

Permalink",False,"How many calls does it take to release a single hellfire missile? How many approvals does it take to sanction the potential death of an innocent in order to kill high-profile terrorists and therefore prevent a terrorist attack from happening? For an average citizen, all these logistics seem to be a straightforward ""due process."" Eye in the Sky, however, tells that it is never simple. It is a meticulous decision making done by military personnel and government, all of whom having their own moral and political ideologies. Director Gavin Hood (Ender's Game, Tsotsi) and screenwriter Guy Hibbert offers no easy choices here. Eye in the Sky is a highly compelling thriller film that opens doors for conversation the moment you leave the theaters.

Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) commands an operation tasked with capturing a group of high-level Al-Shabaab extremists meeting in a safe house in Nairobi, Kenya. When Powell's team discovers the terrorists prepping suicide vests inside the compound, she decides to change the mission objective from ""capture"" to ""kill"". However, such revision in the ""rules of the engagement"" requires approval from several officials across the globe. Circumstances further escalate when a native young girl (Aisha Takow) enters the blast radius. Meanwhile, drone pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul), along with his partner Carrie (Phoebe Fox), shoulder the burden of clicking the trigger and unleashing the hellfire missile. In this time-sensitive political buck passing, everyone has a chance to play god and decide the fate of others'. No matter what decision they choose, one thing is for sure: there will be ramifications and no one will leave emotionally unscathed.

Eye in The Sky builds its momentum in an excellent pace. Although the characters are in different locations, the use of phone and conference calls make them appear as though, they are all in the same room. As the philosophical ping-pong ensues, this film removes any bias and empathizes on each key player. Helen Mirren's steely- eyed character embodies a methodical conviction that is clearly not driven by blind militarism. Her presence alone elevates this film. Alan Rickman, in his final on-screen performance (that alone should persuade you to see this), plays a veteran who has experienced war both as a general and as a soldier. In his controlled, dry voice, he delivers the film's most memorable quote, ""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war."" Aaron Paul may be confined sitting in his quarters for most parts, but he effectively displays anxiety (similar to his role in Breaking Bad) that you can feel the internal turmoil going on in his head. This film also proves to be gripping on a ground level with the tense action scenes courtesy of Barkhad Abdi (last seen as a ship hijacker in Captain Phillips) playing a Kenyan operative who controls the black beetle drone – the film's ""eye in the sky"".

So much is going on in this film beyond the moral case of ""sacrificing an innocent's life for the greater good."" Before it jumps to the ""acceptable"" collateral damage, the characters debate on the legal and political facets of the situation: Do we have the legal right of killing terrorists by drones and depriving them of the due process? Supposing that the innocent girl dies and a footage ends up on YouTube, who wins the propaganda war? Making such a calculated risk requires that lawyers agree on the legality of the ""strike"" and for politicians to step in to see how it will play in the media. Frankly, there are no right and wrong answers, only points and counterpoints.

Eye in the Sky could have delivered more emotional impact if it delved more in its characters on a personal note. Still, it is impossible to come out of this film without your soul shattered in some way. The film ends with the line ""Get some sleep. See you in 12 hours."" These characters may be able to get back to safety of their homes but guilt and sorrow will follow them wherever they go. Eye in the Sky proves that waging a war from the comforts of your chair is no easier than fighting on the ground. The true war is not in the battlefield, it is in the conference room.

Second, I don't know if the filmmakers intended to make an Al-Shabaab/ISIS propaganda film or it just turned out that way but that's how it felt to me. The decision to file a missile with the choices being (a) most likely kill one innocent little girl but take out 2 suicide bombers who are minutes away from killing perhaps hundreds of innocent lives, along with several high value terrorists, or (b) let the little girl live but sacrifice as many as hundreds of innocent lives who will be in the proximity of the suicide bombers....hmmm...

It appeared to me that the film came down on the side of the terrorists -- let them live and blow themselves up later along with an untold number of innocent people...just so the sweet little girl in the wrong place at the wrong time can live...

And let me say that if our real life drone operators are as weak and ""morally""-riddled as the ones portrayed in this film -- then we need new drone operators. Because I'll bet in real life, they don't know all the information that was gathered together and analyzed and discussed to come to the conclusion to fire a missile and I, for one, certainly wouldn't want a rookie drone operator (#1) or one with 2 years of using remote controls (#2) making those kinds of decisions based on what ""they"" might or might not feel is ""right"" or ""moral."" Here's a tip -- DON'T JOIN THE MILITARY...because the military kills people. Duh...

And let's certainly hope that not every decision like this is first run through a political filter (like in this movie) to see if it should be done instead of just doing what is clearly in society's best interests and saving untold number of lives. Yes, its sad there can and is collateral damage but it would be infinitely more sad to have dozens and dozens and dozens of families suffer the loss of their loved one...vs. one family suffering that loss. I know, it's harsh but those are the types of decisions that have to be made.

In the end, this movie just annoyed me and I was left just shouting at the screen (internally of course)... JUST DO IT ALREADY! I thought the best line in the movie came from Alan Rickman's character after the bleeding heart politician chastises him over this girl losing her life when he tells her, ""never tell a soldier they don't know the cost of war.""

Permalink",False,"This film should have 0 ratings: because this film is mass manipulation - brain washing technique to make everybody believe that they care and they will consult before start shooting, that they will delay the killing in order to spare human lives however in reality on July 12 2007 there is real footage of what really takes place , in the real footage they say while the ""eye in the sky"" is watching he is carrying a weapon, in reality it is a camera but do they confirm that it's a weapon? NO you will hear it, they don't do that. As the reporter say there was only one man carrying a weapon but as you will hear they say six or seven individuals are carrying weapons, they were journalists and innocent citizens killed. In the movie the ""eye in the sky watcher"" is shown as a caring, loving person, in reality as you will confirm in this real footage he didn't consult or confirm to save human lives, the ""eye in the sky watcher"" said ""come on fire"". Brainwashing works: 1. With this movie the repetition of this opinion will make you believe that the ""they"" care about you, that they will find the right people for positions with high security clearance who really care about humans. As you will see in the footage that does not happen even the words they use insults like ""there it goes the death bastards"" 2. In the movie they care about the girl who sells bread, in reality in the real footage as you will see what they should have done is to confirm who was inside the VAN before shooting that is their responsibility, the Van was carrying children, and those guys were just going to pick up the survivors of the shooting they didn't have weapons as the eye in the sky watcher said. This movie is a total lie, it would have been different if the movie would at least attempted to show this footage so we can control better our governments leaders and bring them to justice when needed.

Permalink",False,"A few months after my friend was murdered by terrorists in a Kenyan shopping mall, I was watching TV. It was Homeland; there came a moment in the episode I found myself relaxing with that one evening where a character has a lead on a likely opportunity to kill a terrorist who was in the early stages of planning an atrocity. He pulls up alongside the terrorist's car on his motorbike, ready to bomb the vehicle. As he does so, he becomes aware of a problem, someone in the terrorist's car who is not supposed to be there. A child. He rides alongside the car for a while, caught in a terrible moment of indecision. Eventually he rides away, the opportunity untaken.

Pre-Westgate, I would have been where most viewers would have been in that sequence - feeling the anguish, aware of the wrestle with conscience, willing him not to kill the child. But this was a new reality I was now in. There was no conscious mental process. Just this strong, distasteful feeling: take the shot. Risk the child's life for the sake of those who will be killed. Kill the bastard. I remembered how I had felt, what I said in the aftermath of my friend's murder: just give a few minutes alone with one of the perpetrators tied to a chair. It won't take long.

My anger's intensity has relented since, but the wrestles of conscience don't go away. This film's cinema release presented me with an opportunity to see how, or if, I've changed. It tells the story of the hunt for members of Al-Shabaab (the group that murdered my friend). They are tracked by drone to a single house - the order to capture them is about to be given when it becomes apparent that they are preparing suicide vests for an imminent attack. The priority moves from capture to kill; the order to release the missile that will save innocent lives is on the brink of completion when a child sets up to sell bread outside the house in question. She will likely be killed if the missile is fired. The rest of the film is the moral, military and political dilemmas being wrestled with, passed up chains of command inside darkened rooms around the globe, all the while the clock ticking down to massive civilian loss of life. Actually, that depersonalises it. Yes, the clock was ticking - to the murder of my friend, all over again.

The film articulates most of the dilemmas with which I have wrestled since my friend's death. It justice to most of them, if not ever really articulating the political complexities involved. It's economically directed, the lack of violence ratcheting up the tension to levels where you long for some sort of release. The performances are fine - this an ensemble piece, rather than a star vehicle. Helen Mirren does fairly well despite being miscast; I'd like to have seen more of the brilliant Aaron Paul as the soldier with his finger on the button, Barkhad Abdi is consummate, and every line Alan Rickman delivers makes us ache that at what we've lost with his death.

The film offers no answers. Every option is flawed, every character compromised, every view has a valid alternative. The film asks all the questions I have ... and leaves them hanging in a Kenyan dust-bowl, strewn with rubble and human remains. As a leader I empathise with the personal cost of taking decisions most have no understanding of; thanks to some nameless men and women with guns I now have skin in terrorism game, complicating to previously unimagined levels a decision I'll never have to take. Some justice systems give - for good reason - the guilty and the judge the opportunity to hear the affect the crime has had on victims and those close to them. I understand that; but now I've been as close to violent crime as this, I also understand why such revelations should never be the only factor in sentencing the guilty. I, for one, would be too angry to be just.

It's strange to find myself intimately involved in the moral quagmire of violence. All I've come to know is that my cosy neo-pacifist principles no longer sit so easily or safely - I think I still hold them, but I hold them with alarming looseness.

I watched the film on Palm Sunday evening, the first day of Holy Week; an inexorable journey towards an act of horrific, prolonged, violent innocent suffering. That knowledge adds to the mix that mine is a Jesus who knows what it's like to be on the end of both unrighteous anger - his murderers' - and righteous (the anger of His Father which he took the consequences of that day). He didn't deserve that latter anger, but He took it anyway. It says to me that, along with some alarmingly violent expressions of anger in the Psalms - there is a place for this emotion which is often the least acceptable to church subcultures. It says that innocent suffering is right at the heart of what I have given my life to; it is identified with and wept over.

The film left me in anger - and to an extent, that's OK. It also made me fear that maybe the terrorists win even when we capture of kill them - they've reduced us in some way, whether in mind or deed, to their level, even for a moment. But then Holy Week, with its complexities and denials and political blame-shifting and violence and resurrection come along. I don't understand it any more than I used - probably less so, in fact. But the week gives me a glimpse of when this will end, and that Someone at least understands. And that, for now, is just about enough."

Permalink",False,"Here is a timely reminder of the consequences of war, especially with so many battles taking place at the moment. As it's such a topical issue, the themes presented are realistic and engage the viewer in every aspect of the decision making process. It certainly helps when there's Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman (his final live action performance) in the cast. In fact, all the actors deliver stirring and memorable performances that highlight how ethical dilemmas can determine the choices people make. The story provocatively asks if conscience can affect the judgement of military personnel.

Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) is a UK-based military officer who is in command of a top secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya. Through remote surveillance and on-the-ground intel led by Jama Farah (Barkhad Abdi), Powell discovers the targets are planning a suicide bombing. As a result, the objective is changed from capture to kill. American drone pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) is about to engage but discovers a young girl who is in the vicinity of the target. Powell contacts fellow military like Lieutenant General Frank Benson (Alan Rickman), politicians and lawyers to determine whether to take action.

It does take a while to set up the story with the opening scenes taking place in many different locations. All these places are represented by captions on the screen. Once the mission has been explained, the tension of the plot never lets up. The 'Eye in the Sky' of the title represents the drone or satellite imagery that provides a bird's eye view of what is transpiring on the ground. These scenes are expertly handled by director, Gavin Hood. It could have so easily been boring seeing images from the sky but the fluidity of the camera movements ensures that the thrills are maintained throughout the deliberations.

Credit must go to the cast for displaying the tensions and anxieties that some military personnel experience. Mirren hardly makes a poor choice when it comes to role selection and she is at her commanding best in this movie. Rickman will be missed after his untimely death earlier this year but this is a fine performance to bow out with. Paul also deserves recognition for expressing the uncertainty and morals that drone pilots can undergo. Abdi proves that his Oscar nominated performance in Captain Phillips was no fluke and acts with great determination here.

Eye in the Sky is a thrilling and exciting insight of modern warfare. The conversations exchanged between the participants might be technical at times but the viewer gets the gist of what is happening through the superior acting especially by Mirren and Rickman. There's also the action taking place on the screen that shows without a doubt how tense and indecisive things can be behind the scenes and on the ground."

Permalink",False,"This movie is nothing more than official propaganda aimed at convincing the public of the usefulness and merits of war. The people behind this movie want people to believe that war and the military establishments are not the greatest sources of violence in the world. Although in our age, it is obvious (to anyone with an IQ over 50) that, whether their purpose is offensive or defensive, these vast powerful organizations exist only to kill human beings. That is why Propaganda is trying so hard to convince us otherwise... that war is exciting, an opportunity for good hearted people to prove their courage and competence. While recognizing warfare as monstrous (with its very nature of tragedy and suffering) is basic human decency, the sponsors of this movie want us to believe that the masters of war can be deeply troubled by the loss of one or two innocent lives during a military intervention. I wish to remind the mere fact that in Iraq alone (falsely accused of holding weapons of mass destruction), 500 000 kids were killed and Madeleine Albright officialy declared that she thought the price was worth it... the interview is on youtube. I rate this movie 1 not because the actors or the technical stuff didn't do their job well, but because it would be morally revolting to debate the artistic achievements of a brainwashing session."

Permalink",True,"I came for action, but given a totally boring old people talking and talking about nonsense.

I cant believe the good review given here. I admit the acting is good but without any real story its just plain boring.

Let me tell you about the movie. The British force is in charge for an operation some where in Africa, to capture a high wanted terrorists. They found out that the terrorists are hiding in a house and getting ready for 2 suicides bombing.

After that the old people argues and talk talk talk.... for at least one and a half hour. Only to decide if they will blow the house or not. The situation became more boring when they had the permit to launch missile,but there was a girl that get in the way.

Yup, that pretty much summarized the movie. 1 hour and a half of nonsense, and 3 minutes of resolve. Would not recommend except for people who love all talk no action movie.

The whole movie is pathetic emotional blackmail that is designed to paralyze those who have to fight the real war against terror. In real war the idea is to destroy the enemy not yourself! If all soldiers acted the way these do, then the West will be destroyed - but perhaps that is the goal of the producers, writers and directors of this nonsense! Yes, let's just sit around pondering the life of one human being while we watch terrorists carry out their evil goals!

Permalink",False,"The film was a nice fantasy building up the tension. Will she / won't she sell the flat bread and avoid getting blown up. Questions to ask yourself: 1) Why wasn't the Kenyan government at a high level involved in decisions regarding the possible death of its own citizens on their own soil. the focus was on UK and US passport holders. Hello there were many Kenyans on the scene as well. Backdoor colonialism? Would the US or the UK like it of the Russians decided to launch a helfire missile attack on Chechyns in Washington or London without even conferring with the domestic authorities. Hollywood simpletons at their best 2) I wept... with laughter.. as I watched supposedly crying drone pilots so tortured with conscience. You just need to watch actual, live footage of US helicopter pilots in the Snowdon film to hear there audio high fives as they gun down terrorists plus an known Reuters Journalist and a civilian who comes and tries to help and his child. Their touch feeler comment being ""Well they shouldn't be in a war zone should they"". 3) And on what planet does a US drone pilot take orders directly from a UK military officer without a senior US officer intervening and have the Brits make contacts directly with their war department. The yanks are even colonising themselves now. 4) A hell-fire missile has a maximum velocity of 950 mph which is 1300 ft per second. Let's assume a very low speed of 1000 ft per second to allow for acceleration. The drone was at 20,000 feet which means a launch to impact time of 20 seconds. not 50 seconds as the film states. Maybe the missile had a stroke of conscience as well and slowed down to give the girl a chance and weep a few e-tears. Clearly the Hollywood producer simpletons can't even use google or a calculator.

Anyway I guess the retail public likes to think that the entire political establishment of two nations is involved every time there is a drone attack. How, how very noble and civilised and carefully thought through it all is. Keep dreaming , war is ugly just admit it and get on with assassinations if that is the only way of winning. Films like this just make IS laugh."

Permalink",False,"Are our political leaders really the dithering, self seeking personalities that this film makes them out to be? We are all familiar with the few being sacrificed for the greater good; this film implies once the few become familiar, the decision process is marred.

However, this is overall a very good and well intentioned movie, probably the finest that Gavin Hood has ever made. Of course, he is on familiar ground back in the continent of Africa and his empathy with the way this continent is used for the evil ends of extremist groups shines throughout.

Generally speaking, I was more engaged with the first part of the film when the plot is set up, and Helen Mirren as a dedicated army colonel is chasing down Al Shabab in Kenya. The army has tracked down extremists to Nairobi and is sending in a drone to investigate a group of people heading for a house in the suburbs. Mirren wants to blow it up, the drone identifies a group of wanted terrorists, including British nationals, and slowly politicians get involved in the decision making process, and worse still, it looks as if a suicide bombing mission is about to happen.

I really found all this most engaging. The birds eye view of the drone turned out to be fascinating, as Hood lets the cameras explore through the eyes of hummingbird and bug drones.

Then the suits, i.e. the politicians start dithering.... and dithering... and changing their minds, often. The plot is further complicated by the need to reduce collateral damage, and when a child becomes involved in this, its a bit like Hood's old Tsotsi movie again, with a bigger and more dramatic subject.

The finale is stunning and almost redeems the pain that has gone on for about forty five minutes previously. Hood does a superb job of directing and the able cast, headed up by the no nonsense Mirren, graphically show us their emotional perspectives on the whole incident. Its just a pity that the story line gets caught up in a sort of time warp as the dithering goes on.

Despite its flaws, its well worth watching, and I really would have liked to have given it a better rating.

Permalink",True,"In this the 21st century, wars are fought in large part by lawyers. Split second decisions have to be kicked about and sent to higher ups and second-guessed by lawyers. No one in command wants to make the call.

The spectacle of kibitzing lawyers is on full display in ""Eye In The Sky"", an exasperating film dealing with a drone strike in Kenya. The target is located and the drone is ready to strike - except that the commander of the strike (Helen Mirren) can't get clearance for the reasons mentioned above. All concerned dither and kick the can to someone else. Compounding the problem are two wimpy, tremble-chinned drone operators who are obsessed with collateral damage, despite the fact that the damage would be worse if the mission is not carried out.

The hero of the film is none other than perennial baddie Alan Rickman, who tries to fight through all the feckless opposition to the strike. It is an aggravating 102 minutes to sit through and is probably a good illustration of the gymnastics the modern military has to endure to get anything important done. It is Rickman who nails it when he says, ""Never tell a soldier he doesn't know the cost of war"". It is almost worth the admission to hear his supercilious voice say it, in this mostly talking talking picture.

Permalink",False,"With ground wars in Afghanistan and Iraq having killed nearly five thousand U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, not to mention the hundreds of thousands more injured and maimed, the new kind of war against post-Al Qaeda terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabab is being done from the air via drones. But the risk to innocent civilians is no less doing it that way than if there were actual troops with weapons on the ground. If anything, the implications of carrying out these operations from a distance are even greater in legal, military, and moral terms, because every action undertaken will eventually produce blowback that can become a seemingly never-ending cycle of killing and maiming by both sides in the so-called ""War On Terror"". This is what is explored in EYE IN THE SKY.

Helen Mirren and the late Alan Rickman are the top British military officers in charge of going after a cell of Al-Shabab terrorists preparing for a potential suicide attack in Nairobi, where there happen to be two new recruits from Britain and another from the United States who had only recently become radicalized. The terrorists have ensconced themselves at a house in a heavily crowded residential area in the Kenyan capital, and are being closely monitored on the ground by a Kenyan operative (Barkhad Abdi, who portrayed the chief pirate in 2013's CAPTAIN PHILLIPS). Everything is confirmed and ready to destroy both the house and its occupants before they are able to carry out an attack that could kill at least eighty people, but the legal loopholes that they have to go through to be given the authority to carry out the drone strike are immense. And the moral implications intervene when a young Kenyan girl is seen selling bread on the street side of the wall near the safe house, making her a potential casualty, what the military calls by the all-encompassing Orwellian euphemism ""collateral damage."" And the two U.S. military officers (Phoebe Fox, Aaron Paul) who are piloting the drone and its missile are watching all this from their seats at an air force base near Las Vegas.

Even when the strike is carried out after a lot of hand-wringing, resulting in the deaths of the terrorists and innocent civilians simply caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, the reverberations of what was done go well beyond the blast zone in Nairobi. When, after the strike, Rickman tells one of his government's heads ""Never tell a soldier that he doesn't know the cost of war"", he doesn't mean just the dead people at the strike itself, but the psychological toll it takes on the military, both officers and soldiers alike, and the implications for the world at large It would be a fallacy, following how badly both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were botched by our political leaders here in America who were blinded by their own venality and arrogance, to think that the costs of carrying out a successful strike don't weigh heavily on the people in the military who are charged with approving such strikes and the soldiers or pilots responsible for carrying them out. This is the crux of the matter in EYE IN THE SKY, as shown by director Gavin Hood (ENDER""S GAME; X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE; RENDITION) and screenwriter Guy Hibbert (FIVE MINUTES OF HEAVEN). Instead of being a rock 'em, sock 'em gung-ho action flick seemingly approved for public consumption by Bush, Cheney, et al, what we get instead is a very concise look at the military, legal, and, above all, the moral implications of our drone strike policies. Mirren and Rickman (the latter often known for playing ruthless villains, as he did masterfully in 1988's DIE HARD) are excellent in their roles, even though they don't share any actual screen time together, but that is not to diminish the contributions made by Paul, Fox, or Abdi. Nothing is done melodramatically or for the sake of showing the adrenaline lust for bloodthirsty proactive violence against undoubtedly cold-blooded inhuman monsters. For that reason, EYE IN THE SKY is a film well worth seeing and discussing."

Permalink",False,"In ""Air Force One"" (1997) Gary Oldman's hijacking terrorist rebuffs the President's daughter's claim that the two are unalike – ""Why? Because he does it in a tuxedo with a telephone call and a smart bomb?"". Warfare has changed immeasurably in the last twenty years with the introduction of ever-more ingenious drone technology, allowing armchair generals to be just that cosily dispatching bad guys from the comfort of their own fireside with a cigar and a brandy in hand. ""Eye in the Sky"" addresses the issues associated with this capability, showcasing some of the technology used, the truly global distribution of operations, the stresses placed on drone operators and the political ramifications of being able to SEE everything happening in real-time and in great detail.

The film focuses on an operation to capture a cell of the Al Shabaab terrorist group in Kenya, holed up in a highly defended suburb of Nairobi. Political ramifications result from the fact that two of the terrorists are British nationals and one is American born. Helen Mirren (""The Queen"") plays Colonel Katherine Powell (as a strong female role model that is to be commended) heading up the military operations. Alan Rickman is her boss, Lieutenant General Frank Benson, handling the politics within the ""Cobra"" meeting in Whitehall. Flying the key drone itself, and being put under great stress, are pilots Steve Watts (Aaron Paul, ""Breaking Bad"") and rookie Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox, ""The Woman in Black 2"").

While much of the action is 'remote', we also have feet on the street in the form of Somali-born Jama Farah (Barkhad Abdi), swapping sides from his terrorist role in ""Captain Phillips"" to support the good guys. And finally adding a strong human angle is young Kenyan girl Alia (Aisha Takow) trying to enjoy her childhood amid the repressive Islamic regime.

This subject has been handled before: Ethan Hawke's ""Good Kill"" from 2014 and the dreadful looking 'B-movie' called ""Drones"" all focused on the mental state of drone pilots inflicting their video-games style justice from the safety of their US bases. Where ""Eye in the Sky"" goes one better is in focusing on the tense triangle of decision-making between military, legal and political factors at play.

""Eye in the Sky"" is an odd curate's egg of a film – really good in places. The action scenes are well handled with nail-biting tension built up at times: never has the sale of bread been more gripping! Particularly tense are the scenes involving Barkhad Abdi who is (once again) excellent in his role as Hollywood's ""go to Somali""! On home ground the film is less sure-footed. While Guy Hibbert's story rightly balances the action with the dramatic tensions of the decision-making process, the dithering that ensues reaches almost comical proportions at one point, painting British government in a very poor and (I hope to God) unrealistic light. I can only dread to think what American audiences think when they watch this film! In comparison, the US politicians are portrayed as much more analytical and matter of fact. Probably frustrating the hell out of American audiences though will be the portrayal of their military pilots who – I would presume – are diligently selected and trained in real-life to 'disengage brain and follow orders' without question in a combat situation: not as featured in the film.

A film like this lives and dies by the quality of its special effects, and these (by Mickey Kirsten and Vasili Rinquest) are up to snuff, with excellent highlighting of the ingenious drone gadgets in the military's arsenal. Another shout-out should go to Megan Hill for some very tight and effective film editing in the action scenes.

The director is Gavin Hood (""Ender's Game"") who also appears as the US Lt Colonel in the film.

Helen Mirren – not everyone's cup of tea as an actress – is splendid here as the frustrated Colonel and many of the supporting cast also excel: Monica Dolan (so brilliant in the BBC's ""W1A"") is brilliantly irritating as the Cobra voice of conscience! But this will be a film that will be remembered as the last for the late and great Alan Rickman who died suddenly of pancreatic cancer in January. Surely no actor was better at delivering such deliberate and clipped lines as Rickman, and he will be sorely missed. It is almost physically painful to watch his final scenes in the film, and he (nearly) exits with a fine and memorable last line of dialogue. R.I.P. Mr Rickman.

In summary, this is a highly watchable and gripping film, regrettably diluted by an over-egged and unrealistic dose of political dithering in the storyline.

Permalink",False,"Reminiscent of Good Kill - but the difference between can be summed up in a few words - British production vs American.

Where GK succumbs to the usual US sentimentality and black/white ""answers"", the EitS remains guarded, cerebral and dares to leave many problems unsolved.

Excellent acting, complex plot line and sustained suspense without cheap histrionics. Mirren is at her best when she renders a clipped English accent, Aaron Paul delivers what Breaking Bad promised, and the film is intelligently edited.

Highly recommended.

Permalink",True,"I give this a generous 3 for decent acting by its largely British cast, nothing else.

Let me tell you about the morality of ""collateral damage"" in military drone strikes against Islamic threats:

1. THEY would never extend the same checks and balances for us. They just STRIKE and by that I mean bomb innocent people.

2. The chances of having some insubordinate little imbecile who questions a general's authority are zero to none in any NORMAL chain of command.

3. Trying your best to save ONE girl's life whilst putting 80 in risk is just LUNACY. War is WAR.

Ridiculously progressive film about the morality of this 21st Century's amoral wars (aren't they all?) against an immoral enemy.

PS - I haven't been active here for a good 4 or 5 years, but this film made me log in again. Repeat: it is RUBBISH.

Permalink",True,"This movie was beyond terrible. Oh no, we want to bomb 3 of the most wanted terrorists in Africa who we haven't seen together in years. There is a little Kenyan girl who might get killed. We'll have to consult the most important political figures in the US and UK to decide what to do! In war unfortunately, there is collateral damage and pretending that the heads of state are consulted every time a little girl is in the way is just a way to make people feel good about it. Whatever the merits or lack of them are of the war on terror, this pretend fantasy is sickening. Never mind that even in the movie they say all sorts of people outside the compound are going to get killed anyway. Presumably they magically know that none of them are children.

Then we have the electronic flying beetle. It's battery runs out. It can't provide a picture so presumably they don't really know who will be killed (to add to the tension). This doesn't make a lot of sense since the girl is outside and they have a plane showing a high res perfectly stationary picture shortly after the drama of the beetle going out. It's amazing how a plane zooming around can show a still picture, though doesn't explain why they were so worried about the beetle since people are clearly visible from the plane cam.

Just avoid this offensive junk.

Permalink",True,"Was looking forward to this movie but was disappointed. Came across as unrealistic. Although Mirren is an excellent actress, she was too old for the part and was miscast. Although the tension build up was initially effective, the hand wringing by the military and the politicians was drawn out and laboured and soon became tedious. I think if one bread seller was weighed against a group of two identified ranking terrorists, one bomb maker and two armed suicide bombers under deployment then realistically the bread is going to be toast. 'Collateral damage' is an unpleasant face of conflict, enough news items repeatedly show this. I'd hope the actor's real life counterparts are more decisive one way or another.

Permalink",False,"Is it right to use a drone attack to shoot a bomb onto people? What if they're planning a terrorist attack that could kill a hundred people, or more? You may argue that it's better to capture them than to kill them, but most people would be fine with taking them out, no big loss for the innocents of the world they'll destroy. OK, fine. What about those surrounding the blast? Call it collateral damage and call it a day, or what if the moral implications actually, you know, stick with you? Eye in the Sky takes what may be to some a big of a cheap shot with this issue: the filmmakers set up the story of a little girl in Somalia (who also happens to have a father/family situation that is not fanatical, and there's a scene that makes sure we the audience know that) who has to sell bread on the street. Turns out she's selling bread right outside of the house where a major terrorist (actually a few) are preparing for a suicide-bombing attack. We know this because the characters in various military positions - the pilot who will pull the trigger from a Nevada base (Aaron Paul), the officer who has been tracking the terrorists for months (Helen Mirren), and her superiors (the late Alan Rickman among others) who have to make the call as British and American super-powers. Strike and deal with the (possible) death of a little girl, or let them go and deal with the, shall one say, 'propaganda' problems in having people die by the terrorists and that those in power knew about it.

In the trailer for this movie some critic compared this all to Dr. Strangelove, and of course it's easy to see why: it's a movie where we see the various perspectives leading up to a catastrophe. But the real comparison is not with anything satirical (I almost thought there would be more of some humorous commentary to the movie because of that quote, which isn't the case), but the brother-film to Strangelove, also from 1964, Fail Safe. That's a much more sobering, serious and genuinely harrowing movie about how everyone who is witnessing something unfolding have to use things like patience and control and usually picking between the lessor of two options when going down a dark path. But unlike Fail Safe and that era, which was set in a cold war with a somewhat more abstract notion about America and Russia colliding in nuclear fallout, Eye in the Sky is about something sadly more common: the war on terror and its implications when fighting it from way outside of where it's actually taking place, in comfortable rooms watching things happening on screens provided by a flying beetle with a camera and a drone.

I liked how the movie makes you think about these issues of should-you-or-shouldn't-you (there may seem to be a right answer for the hard-liners, on either side, but where you get more into the middle, which is where more people are, is where the ambiguity lies), while still being entertaining and engrossing. You get to see actors like Mirren and Rickman and even Barkhad Abdi (first time we've seen him since Captain Phillips, and showing he can play well outside of that potential typecasting) having to think on screen as well. They have to ponder, they have to decide, and it's fascinating to watch people in a story dealing with consequences which will have actions - whether or not it's for them, or their country, or for others, makes for compelling drama. Especially for Aaron Paul, who is the one who is seeing what everyone else sees but has more distance from (and hasn't had to do something like this), it sets him for inherent drama: do I blow up this girl, or let them go? Do I stall for time or deal with pulling the trigger?

These aren't all necessarily new questions for a war movie dealing more with suspense and a ticking-clock scenario, and to be critical I wish the filmmaking was just a little more cinematic in a way - it's shot by Gavin Hood like something that could be acceptable for a TV movie, less than a major theatrical film (but this may be from it being shot on a digital Red camera instead of on film, even with such high tech it looks kind of flat, except for Mirren's scenes which have a slight tint). And I wish they had gone even *further* with the moral gray area; say, for example, if the little girl had been from a family that were more radical in Islam and weren't OK with the little girl playing with a hoola-hoop, but the British and American officers don't know that - what does that do for the audience?

But what is here is still very good and worth seeing; one may want to go simply because it's Rickman's final screen appearance (in live action, not counting Alice Through the Looking Glass). He gets a final scene in the movie that is wonderful to experience - hoe he puts a fine point on the story in a way that is tragic and terrible - though he's not the only reason to see it. If you're up for a story that treats you like an adult and with the capacity to see people react and think on screen and not jump to conclusions (or, if they do, what that says about them and what happens if they have to backtrack and think again), this is admirable stuff."

Permalink",True,"No less than Helen Mirren was cast to star in this stinker, possibly out of the plausible fear nobody would watch it; and it would have been a good thing, because this film was horrid.

Mirren is a US Military drone commander, she oversees operations for surgical strikes - i.e. throwing bombs on people.

The film is about one such strike, the military needs to throw a bomb on a house. It takes them 80 minutes to throw the bomb.

There's a bit of background development where they locate the target, using far more ""real camera"" footage than necessary (and far less enticing than say, what you have already seen in the Bourne series, or even Bond), including a bit where the ""i'm the captain now"" guy flies a microdrone to spy on the baddies.

And obviously there is an innocent girl, which they made sure to tell us comes from a family who are not-extremists.

Eye In The Sky uses these cheap tricks to ""mount the tension"", but for all except the very naive, it will do little more than mount the boring. For example, the drone pilots are obviously super-sentimental about the strike; the British (by fortunate coincidence there is a British citizen among the lot of the baddies) are obviously ostracising the action and want to go through ""procedure"". I mean .. what are the odds? The this scenario involves so many people whose character is both rare, and guaranteed to generate controversy?

Because if you decided to paint a realistic picture (such as American Sniper did, film which i should probably reevaluate), that a remote village of extremists will most likely have *only* extremists in it, there wouldn't be a plot here - fire bomb, boom, all dead. Deal With It.

The film has even rather cheap production values attached, Mirren's role could have been covered by anyone else, the various supporting roles are chewing the scenery .. this film is garbage.

I'm gonna be super, super generous and give it an extra half point for having a lot of money badly spent thrown in which give it some minimal visual appeal.

My vote: 4.5/10 - propaganda garbage wants you to be sad.

Permalink",False,"The war film genre enables us to confront the realities of war by venting our inner fears and indulging our conceits of victory. But there are many kinds of war film. Depending on theme and purpose, war films can be a hybrid of the adventure, history, drama, thriller, science fiction and even comedy genres. They have recently morphed from trench-and-tank settings to globally dispersed and armchair directed war rooms with real-time engagement resembling a video game with highly sophisticated and deadly accurate killing technology. Far from fantasy war, Eye in the Sky (2015) raises moral and political dilemmas that potentially touch every citizen. Can you imagine one day democratically sharing the decision to bomb a target via your iPhone?

The story unfolds over a few hours when Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) and Lt. Col. Frank Benson (the late Alan Rickman) must convince their political masters to change a 'capture' to a 'kill' mission when they unexpectedly get the opportunity to wipe out several top ranking terrorists in Nairobi. After getting the necessary political and military approvals, a weak link opens up at the trigger pulling end of the chain of command when the soldier authorised to fire the missile sees a young girl near the kill zone. It's a classic morality play: do you save the girl and risk losing the opportunity to eliminate several really bad people who are being fitted with suicide vests that could kill hundreds of innocents? The resulting drama appears fast-paced but is more notable for what does not happen rather than what does because buck-passing between decision-makers delays the critical moment. It's a tense thriller matched by sharp camera-work in what feels like real-time, making the audience both witnesses and judges of the events as they happen.

Mirren and Rickman are superb in their roles. Both skilfully portray the stresses and frustrations of working between the world of the professional soldier and that of the politician. This is not your standard war film and is more about the political dynamics of how war will be waged in the future. While miniaturised beetle drones transmitting high definition video from inside Satan's den looks more like fantasy than war science, remember that similar things were said about the HAL 9000 computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The history of Sci-Fi shows that today's imaginings is tomorrow's reality. So the moral dilemmas in this film are very real. Eye in the Sky stands out as both a thoroughly gripping film and a consciousness raising experience."

The American politicians in the film were clearly made out to be bumbling, war mongering, and soul-less monsters with no regard for human life. War is hell. Innocent people die. The true ""bad guys"" in the film were purposely distanced from the story-line so the film makers could project guilt onto the terrible technology plagued civilized Westerners.

It's really insulting to have this type of ""message"" shoved down our throats constantly from the same Hollywood players. What a wonderful world it would be if everyone loved one another and supported one another and there were no bad guys. Unfortunately, that's not the case and there will always be those that are willing to kill...and die, in the name of something.

Shallow and pedantic. Currently ranked 7.6? C'mon...this is garbage.

Permalink",True,"While this was not a bad little movie, with some wonderful contributions from Alan Rickman in one of his two last roles and Helen Mirren, it wasn't all that an tax. The plot has some serious holes; the touching scene with the army drone pilot almost refusing to carry out the mission because of the poor little bread seller was such b+*&sh%t, it was hard to stomach, as was the Ministry scene with the cow of a female secretary constantly objecting and all of the ministers gathered too lily-livered to make a decision without trying to get someone else to shoulder the blame. Alan Rickman's parting words to Madame Bovine are dead on. In real life, anyone acting the way half of these so-called soldiers did would have been replaced immediately and subsequently sent before a court martial.

Effects are decent, the plot is convincing enough, but all in all this appeared to be another Washington White Wash trying to get everyone to be convinced that soldiers have feelings too (which they do) and that all the touchy-feely crap portrayed here could actually happen.

Drone warfare is ice cold, some might even say cowardly, but very effective and calculated. That's the reality of it.

All in all, worth seeing just because of the performances by Rickman and Mirren, but nothing too far out of the box. Many will be happy if they wait for this to hit DVD or television release.

This film is one of the few I've seen that attempts to deal realistically with the tense relationships between ""Rules of Engagement"", ""Collateral Damage"" and ""war atrocities"". It is the hard choices that define us and define this film. Its intensity grabs you, similar to ""The Hurt Locker"". Well done and very relevant for discussions about today's Drone Wars.

Permalink",False,"Films are direct embodiments of what they are, we need only take an honest look. Some viewers have held this one up as important debate that brings attention to cruel double-binds of war, others have decried it as one-sided propaganda. But what do the mechanics of how it has been put together reveal?

We have viewers watching a movie that poses a grave moral conundrum unfold across screens, top military brass and politicians in various rooms as they contemplate a drone strike. If they decide to strike, innocents will die. If they don't, suicide bomb vests are being prepared inside the house, innocents will die soon after. We are viewers watching viewers watch a morality play about what to do.

It is a morality play; the particulars all simplified to make obvious the specific moral response. The setting has been simplified for the same narrative economy as every play, a jihadist hiding house surveyed from the sky. The innocents who stand to die are reduced down to a single little girl, who we have seen before as cute and loved by her parents. The desired reaction is reduced to the drone operator shedding tears over a magnified image of the little girl as he fights orders to kill.

What to make of all this, those of us who would rather confront ugly, complicated realities anyway? Would there be a movie at all if it was a gangly, ugly twentysomething or a middle- aged street vendor we had to mull over? Having bureaucrats obligingly swap opposing points of view, is there something to actually contemplate in all this?

There is no debate here. It's the kind of debate we would be having in the scenario with having to decide to push the red button that kills a hundred people or the one that kills two hundred. We have simply arrived too late, given the controls too late. We should be asking, how did it come down to where these two are our only options, or are they?

Look, film has the power to purify and bring to light, but where are you going to point? You have the opportunity to hover over the world, swoop from above to magnify and project back to screens all over the world. And it's a complete waste when there's nothing more to take back home beyond a mere somnolence, beyond a flimsy sense of 'humanity'. Spielberg has made a career out of this, choosing to find just those historic moments when the world is tearing itself up, often war, never trying to find the moral impasse where it lurks next to us and doesn't make itself obvious, in mundane reality, then lazily uses the world at its most cruel and senseless to bludgeon the viewer with how cruel it all is. It's a cynical thing.

The moments that test or betray humanity do not begin with having to decide what button to press. They begin on a mundane day with two people talking."

Permalink",True,"This movie had a good start with great optics and ideas about the concept of warfare and the perspective and tactics that must be gone through to create military decisions.

The characters had decent acting and their roles were interesting.

Each character showed their likely background by strong representation and inference to their military prowess. Then, fatally, each character began to fall apart in an EXTREMELY unrealistic, leftist way. The people who argue for the stupid arguments that cost lives are created to be heroes, and the people who are doing the correct military decisions are demonized and created to look like self absorbed monsters.

Long story short, war targets are tracked down and within reach but a ethical dilemma is presented because a girl would be likely harmed to rid the military targets. One girl, singular. The war targets began to put on suicide bombs and gear to go out and massacre people. That is where the movies takes a nose dive.

All of the sudden the directing ONLY points out the tragedy of the girl. Everything becomes about how she will die (not the other 80 people who are projected to be killed should the target not be bombed).

The fat leftist politician actually says - I would rather 80 people die than 1 girl. WTF!!!

Then 1 by 1 the director makes all these hardened military grade personnel from 3 different countries start crying because they know they will need to cause the tragic death of ONE to save EIGHTY.

In sum, the director wants people to focus on the emotions of a person losing their life in hostile territory instead of 80 who retain theirs.

Now, if a school bus drove up, maybe.


Bottom line is this - I love Helen Mirren and the rest of the cast was good as well. BUT, this story line was the worst. Trust me, I get the idea of the conflict inherent in war, but whoever wrote this story doesn't. Instead of doing some research, they just made up a bunch of crap to support an idea.

Permalink",False,"Eye in the Sky is directed by Gavin Hood and stars Helen Mirren, Aaron Paul, Alan Rickman and Barkhad Abdi.

Col. Katherine Powell, a military officer in command of an operation to capture terrorists in Kenya, discovers a complication through surveillance and intel that forces an international dispute in order to avoid collateral damage.

Eye in the Sky is a vast look into how traumatic and extremely tough it is to work as a drone pilot in the military. Aaron Paul portrays his character wonderfully, and truly breaks from his most popular and beloved character from Breaking Bad with ease. Helen Mirren is brilliant as Powell and clicks perfectly with the story and the cast. Barkhad Abdi isn't a terrifying Somali pirate in this movie, he's actually on the ""good side"" here as Jama Farah who works for the Kenyan military and works on the ground getting important intel that's absolutely vital for the mission. Another realistic performance by another great newcomer. Alan Rickman shares with us his last chance to shine on the big screen and he does so with an impeccable charm and dignity. We have lost a magnificent actor and this serves as a nice send-off.

The story and screenplay is fast-paced and heartfelt, with the tension forever rising sky high as the mission twists and turns until the very last couple of minutes. It's no action movie, instead it deals with the excruciating struggle that our characters go through, with huge scenes of dialogue that never feel separated or disjointed with any previous scene. Imagine Captain Phillips and Sicario, but in the sky.

The cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos is subtle and smart with some stunning shots that are weaved into the story throughout the running-length. The sound design was also carefully thought-through and sat perfectly in between the music and dialogue. The usual explosions are often cut short to leave you in silence as you witness the aftermath unfold.

Music by Paul Hepker & Mark Kilian is dark, gritty and tense yet so beautiful when the time is right. It's simple in style, yet complex in the detail and sound design, bringing a great experience with or without the picture.

My verdict; Eye in the Sky is a movie that must be seen by everyone, especially in cinemas so there are absolutely no distractions. This is one of the best modern warfare movies to date, and I'm sure most will agree with me when I say it's a thriller that constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Eye in the Sky, 8/10."

Permalink",True,"There's a wording that ""We'll kill 4 million Iraqis and a bicycle-repairman "". This movie is telling us exactly the same thing. No matter how democratic they are, the innocent doomed from the very beginning, so it is a ridiculous democracy.

Because it's a UK film, so in contrast, the US minister doesn't care killing any civilian while UK ministers discussing civilian loss percentage. In the film the UK show more democracy than the US, also a ridiculous point.

Maybe this film is good for the compassionate ones, but bad for the others.

Permalink",False,"Would you be willing to kill a little girl if it meant saving the lives of 80 other innocent people? Would you willingly let a little girl die so you could also kill a terrorist in her vicinity who was about to go on a suicide mission?

This is the question that the film tries to deal with, explain, ask us. As an audience we take up the two opposing sides. Kill her and save the other innocent people. Let her live as there is no way can we kill a little girl as that would be a media nightmare and the terrorists would win the propaganda war.

This movie grips you from the very beginning and does not let go. For its running time I forgot that there was a world around me and that this was just a movie.

And in spite of a straightforward plot there were plenty of the twists and turns within the world that was created and brought alive here.

This reminded me of another film called Unthinkable which made the audience and the lead character face a similar dilemma. Both films are remarkable.

Both Unthinkable and Eye In The Sky are thrillers that stay with you a long time after they have ended. They may seem like American propaganda films but they are much, much more as these situations will be faced by security forces the world over.

Put them on your must watch list. And spend some time thinking, what would you do in that situation?"

In telling its sickeningly perverted story, the producers manage to make the West the bad guys and gloss over the barbarities of the terrorists, if not even make the terrorists the heroes of this filth. One can only pray that the real people who are responsible for our safety have some testicles instead of these teary-eyed freaks that can't seem to shoot a water pistol without breaking down sobbing. An incredible low point for Aaron Paul's career, he should be ashamed to allow himself to portray such an unmitigated wimp.

ALL the characters were represented with realistic emotion for the role they played, and the drama that unfolded was intense, painful, and heartbreaking. I can't call this film entertaining, but it was meaningful, well done, and deserves recognition for such a thorough approach to the ethical questions faced by all the parties involved in warfare by remote control...

Permalink",True,"Gavin Hood's Eye in the Sky pulls a breathtaking entertainment out of an intellectually rigorous debate on the ethics of remote war-making.

An opening title quotes Aeschylus: ""Truth is the first casualty of war."" Even in this lettering, the ""truth"" fades away.

As the various American, British and African principles debate the chance to kill three most-wanted Islamic terrorists and prevent two suicide bombers, the dialogue demonstrates increasingly thin shavings off the truth. Colonel Powell (Helen Mirren) is the prime practitioner as she strives to persuade the political, legal and military consultants to fire the missile, despite its threat to a nine-year-old Nairobi girl who pauses her hula hooping to sell her mother's bread. That is: she's really cute.

The girl has to be cute, plucky, endearing, and — to boot — harassed by an Islamic fanatic, to fully flesh out the value of the ""innocent"" threatened in collateral damage. A statistic is one thing, but fleshing out such an appealing ""innocent"" really focuses the debate.

And a brilliant, circumspect debate this film provides. How much ""collateral damage"" can we allow when there's a chance to snuff major terrorist operatives, especially when it would prevent two suicide bombings? What latitude is allowed the military, especially as conditions change from the original mission's approval? What legal issues arise and what clout is allowed them? How pertinent should political considerations be? And public relations?

When American and British citizens are targeted, of course, the dilemmas compound, even if they are converts to terrorism. International sensitivities abound when American soldiers join a British operation to kill three nationalities of terrorism — in a friendly country.

This film has the virtue of giving each side in the debate a full, respectful airing. It's not an easy matter. The situations are too complex for simple positions and confidence. But if we don't acknowledge the legal and moral shadings then we're akin to the terrorists.

Our initial takeaway from the plot is confidence in the technological power at the West's disposal, with its spy and firing drones and its incredible communication systems — till a battery dies.

But the additional point is that which separates us from the radicals. For all our technology we are also ruled — if not afflicted — by moral and ethical responsibilities. That's what puts us at a disadvantage when we face unscrupulous radicals. We are ruled by principles, where they can do what they can. Our moral restraints may balance out our technological advantages — but they are precisely what justifies our fight against the lawless. If we are no more moral than they, what right have we to fight them?

To the film's credit, we don't get the sentimental happy ending we're hoping for. The little girl's death leaves us properly unsettled by the power of modern technology and the moral ambiguity that surrounds its use. Especially when we succeed.

Permalink",False,"War has changed over the years, now it's mostly fought in booth and meeting tables on far sides of globe. One would not think that this set-up works like a charm in creating tension, perhaps even better than any display of bullet spree in recent time. A collaboration effort of great cast portraying parties of many countries as they battle for morale and literally inches of survival.

This is a scouting mission played by drone, the eye in the sky, as it follows extremist faction. It's monitored by different parties with different agendas as the nature of the mission gets more volatile with each passing moment. Hellen Mirren and Alan Rickman are particularly amazing in their roles, pushing the seemingly cold yet necessary tactic.

Barkhad Abdi serves as the ground unit, he's the one who experiences the actual mission first hand. It's ridiculously gratifying how the mission hinges on trivial stuffs one would take for granted and how the lives at stake merely go about their daily routines and never knowing that their fates are decided right that moment by strangers.

There's an intense argument when they need to respond with lethal force. It escalates extremely rapidly with many clashing ideologies, there's no exact truth or right course of action to take, and nearly every compromise can be fatal. It's exceptionally well done, even to the point that administrative squabble is done with appealing urgency.

An exceptionally engaging thriller, ""Eye in the Sky"" gives a perspective to espionage warfare and more importantly, genuine human nature."

Permalink",False,"Poignantly directed and masterfully acted, Eye in the Sky gets under your skin more powerfully than any news clip or article. It doesn't hold back on the premise it delivers nor does it in the casts' grounded performances. It's one of the most thought provoking war dramas of recent memory, and a reminder of the talent of the late Alan Rickman.

Gavin Hood directs the fictitious political war thriller about a secret drone mission to take out targeted terrorists in a Kenyan safe house. The mission is comprised when an innocent civilian is seen in harm's way just on the outside of the house.

The film is structured as a one-act thriller with plenty of moving pieces and decisions needed to reach the end goal of killing the terrorists. It's ability to keep the audience engaged without any change of scenery is extremely impressive. It's an ensemble cast led by Alan Rickman, Helen Mirren, and Aaron Paul, but there are realistically 20 or so main cast members, and the screen distribution between them is well-balanced.

It's a film similar to Gone Baby Gone, where I don't know that you can sit through the decision making process of this bombing feeling strongly one way or the other. You can see the thought process on both sides, which makes it both an engaging and timely watch. In all, I can't see how anyone would walk away without an opinion on this difficult but important subject matter.

+Poignant directing

+Pacing, even with it's structure

Permalink",False,"27 April 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Eye in the Sky. A film dedicated In Loving Memory of Alan Rickman, this military/political thriller is a moment in time look at the processes involved in authorising and executing a drone strike. Tense from the outset, we see a British Colonel and a US Colonel co-ordinating Intel and the frustrating dance they have to perform as they manoeuvre through the political, legal and moral minefields of taking one life to save many. Superbly acted by all, Helen Mirren as the British Colonel, was unsurprisingly outstanding in her part, Alan Rickman negotiated the political factions with an air of no nonsense military efficiency tinged with a sense of regretting being in the room at all. The best quote of the whole film comes from Rickman when he states 'Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war!!!!' This 1 hour and 42 minute film will have you glued to your seat and is so thought provoking that it makes your head spin. I think you should go and see it and form your own opinion.

Permalink",False,"What is one life worth? What if you had to make the ultimate decision of killing one innocent person to wipe out many that aren't. Would you do it for the supposedly greater cause, or would the decision where there could potentially be innocent people hurt, or killed as collateral damage, would this affect your decision at all? This is some of the very important questions and issues that the new film, Eye in the Sky brings up. This is essentially a film about the powers that be in various different forms of government, who are tasked with the almost impossible decision of destroying one innocent person who would be caught in the aftermath of many that are guilty and that they want destroyed. The film doesn't just toy with easy answers, or tries to make up it's own either. This is a very delicate subject matter and the film gives much thought and depth to this question. What if they were to do nothing and not strike at all and the wanted people would get off completely free, but then could essentially kill many others with their acts of terrorism, or violence? If the powers that be did nothing to stop this, then essentially that would probably be their loss and a great victory for the people they are up against. Not to mention that it would bring much scrutiny upon them. However on the other side of the coin, what if you were to take them out with one single blast which would most likely destroy them, but could and most likely would kill an innocent bystander. This would perhaps give more sympathy to the other side and paint a more vicious and not so sympathetic form for our governments in this side of the world. The ultimate question really is a tricky one isn't it? Here we have all the players from the colonel who wants this mission carried out as quickly and easily as possible, but then we also have other members of government to the people who will actually initiate the shots themselves who strongly question if what they are doing is morally right, or not. The film essentially shows that in war and perhaps in politics as well as times, that there are sometimes no easy answers. While the film in a certain regard does give us it's own moralizing and tries to answer the question for us (which could possibly turn off some viewers depending on your political leanings), I still think these are important questions that the film is asking us and questions that should mean not only something to us the average viewers of the film, but also to the various forms of government and to those in charge who make these kind of decisions on an everyday basis. I will not give anything away, but as I mentioned above the film does in a sense provide us with their interpretation of an answer, or in a sense maybe it is saying there is no right, or wrong answer in this type of situation and in reality is just showing that in matters of war there is usually no winners, or losers because more often than not you will have innocent people killed and not so innocent people as well and is all that always truly justified, or warranted? Eye in the Sky has one of the strongest screenplays of any of the films I have seen in this still very young new year. It is a screenplay with top notch dialogue and situations that command your attention by giving us real life scenarios and complicated situations and making us thrilled as well as captivated to see just how it will turn out because ultimately as a viewer the film allows you to care about the casualties involved and knowing that either decision will end in loss of life. The acting all by very good actors here is performed flawlessly and is a great final film for the late Alan Rickman, who should be very proud of his work here. The film is edited in such a way that no single moment is wasted and everything counts for something and our interest and attention is held the entire way through. This is a film that is not only tremendously entertaining and made in the best way possible, but it also allows us to confront and ask our inner selves about what we as a person would do in this situation and the answer might frighten you and more importantly make you think which is what a great film does. One of the best films of the year so far."

Permalink",False,"""Never tell a soldier he doesn't understand the cost of war."" Alan Rickman's final words in his final on-screen movie. This movie will make you question what you think you would do in a situation, and it makes you question the moral line you believe you have for yourself. When does that line get blurry? When does it get crossed?

Alan Rickman is my all-time favorite actor. I say is because it will always remain that way. I would have seen, and bought, this movie just because he is in it and because I own all his movies. However, after seeing the trailer I know I would have also seen it if he hadn't been in it. His performance is wonderful as always. The movie is dedicated to his memory, as he died shortly before its release. It's his last on- screen movie and he did wonderful.

Ellen Mirren is good as usual. She has to make a call that makes you feel a lot of different things.

When does the life of one become worth it to save the lives of many? It's the ongoing question in this movie, along with when politics should or should not be mixed with military operations. In a world that is at war, this is a question I imagine many of those involved asking regularly. We think we know what we would do, but do we? All throughout the movie I agreed with Alan and Ellen in what should happen, but even now that I'm back home I can't think about how that makes me feel. There are a lot of movies coming out these days that are fluffy, or action filled or fun.

There aren't nearly enough movies these days that make you think. I love that this one did and recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a truly good movie with truly strong acting by everyone from the extras to the main stars."

The predictable script, tin-eared dialog, lackluster direction, and film school cinematography would defeat the best efforts of any actor, so let's not hold this cheesy mess against Helen Mirren, for one. It's one of those movies where they use quick cutting from locale to locale to try and simulate momentum, but after the first ten minutes, you realize that this is going to be a slow slog to nowhere, Helen Mirren or no Helen Mirren. Aaron Paul delivers the most wooden performance I have seen in many a moon, and the dialog in the war room had me groaning out loud. Movies can be produced quite inexpensively these days, which gives hambones like this crew an opportunity to hire a few decent actors and try and convince us we are watching a real movie. We're not. This is rubbish, plain and simple.

Permalink",False,"Exactly what a thriller should be, Eye in the Sky has high stakes, conflicting motives, believable characters with a tangle of personalities, and a ticking clock. If you've seen the trailer for this film, you know that British and American military forces have put an ""eye in the sky""—an armed drone with a powerful camera—to track members of a terrorist cell in Kenya, including an American citizen and two Brits. It finds them. The rest of the film is ""what next?"" When the terrorists are found to be preparing for more suicide bombings, what was intended to be a capture mission soon must be reevaluated—legally, militarily, and politically. Director Gavin Hood assembled a terrific cast, with Helen Mirren as the U.K.'s colonel in charge of the operation from an underground military bunker and Aaron Paul as the Nevada-based ""pilot"" of the drone. Alan Rickman (so glad to see him, so unutterably sad he's gone) is a British lieutenant general supervising the mission from a wood-paneled conference room, along with high-ranking British government officials (reminiscent of the crowded situation room when Osama bin Laden was killed). It's a room filled with more indecision than people. On the ground in Kenya is a British agent played by Academy Award nominee Barkhad Abdi, whose life if caught isn't worth the proverbial plugged nickel, the terrorists in a supposed safe house, the local Sharia law enforcement and security squads, and a neighboring family of innocents. Most of the movie concerns the deliberations of the groups in the bunker, in the conference room, and in the Nevada ""pilot house"" as they see what the cameras can tell them—a lot, really—about what is unfolding inside the safe house. They're aided by a facial recognition expert based in Hawai'i watching the same screens, attempting to verify the terrorists' identities. Because of the incredible detail of these images, the transitions from screens to street scenes (mostly from the point of view of Abdi) feel seamless. The key issues are ""collateral damage""— inevitable or unacceptable?—and whether a nation can pursue its citizens across friendly countries' borders. Says Wired reviewer K. M. McFarland, ""it's the best movie yet to tackle the legal and moral quagmire surrounding modern technological warfare."" That review also describes the degree of realism behind the movie's rather amazing drone technology. In the screenplay written by Guy Hibbert, the military and the political leaders views' on the situation differ irreconcilably. The U.K. military want to move; the politicians are cautious. Those views are flipped for the Americans. (Actor Laila Robins, seen locally on stage numerous times, plays a U.S. security official.) Filmed in South Africa in 2014, the staging of the safe house neighborhood carries a dusty realism that's a stark contrast to the diplomatic h.q. and the high-tech pilots' domain. Yet, the decision makers in those far-removed settings are not at all disengaged from the consequences on the ground. Alan Rickman's final words to a recalcitrant politician are: ""Never tell a soldier he does not know the cost of war."""

In the end this film does a poor job of arguing for or against drone strikes. None of the characters evoke any emotional bond with the audience. For a truly sobering look at how misused drone strikes are, watch Good Kill instead.

The pull of what to do and what would you the viewer decide is the heart of things with this film.

It is not a war film that moves quickly from event to event. As mentioned, it kind of focuses on one event and investigates everything about that event. Some folks will have no attention span for this type of moral/war, evaluation.

I found it interesting and just sad. It made me think more about this subject matter. You will have to decide for yourself.

I am not sure this will ever be one of those blockbusters, but it is a well made film that makes the viewer think about drone warfare.

Everything from the hammer, to the bullet, to the trigger of a gun had to weigh the pros and cons of ""neutralizing"" a target before a decision can be made. Without culpability, a well-oiled machine can do it's job efficiently, effortlessly, heartlessly. But if we plug in the human element, and add in the collective experiences of multiple men and women, things become much, much more complicated.

Eye in the Sky addresses these themes in a smart and effortless way, combining a stellar ensemble cast and a labyrinthine script by Guy Hibbert. The film starts with steely-eyed Colonel Powell (Mirren) of English military intelligence, tracking a cell Al-Shabaab terrorists. On the ground in Nairobi, Kenya, Damisi (Weyime) and Jama (Abdi) spy on the cell with various small drones and spy equipment. U.S. Air Force analysts in Hawaii reference the faces they see with a database of names while Lieutenant General Frank Benson (Rickman) supervises from London with several members of her Majesty's government. The eye in the sky is a Reaper drone controlled from Nevada and piloted by 2nd Lieutenant Steve Watts (Paul) and A1C Carrie Gershon (Fox). What starts as a routine intelligence operation meant to increase situational awareness turns into an escalating debacle when Al- Shabaab leadership unexpectedly shows up, armed with explosives.

The film asks a lot of it's audience, forcing the viewer to consider the increasingly ambiguous situation through different lenses. There are objectors who bring up the legal ramifications of targeting British and American citizens, analysts who concern themselves with Collateral Damage Estimates, British officials who debate the possible political fallout, bureaucrats unwilling to be pull the trigger and military brass who worry if they do nothing lives will be lost. No matter your inclinations and attitudes towards drone warfare, each unique perspective is so well defined as to question if not outright challenge your worldview. Director Gavin Hood leaves no one off the hook, coolly analyzing every angle like a college professor using midwifery to garner understanding and empathy.

Yet Hood gets lost in the tall grass when he ruminates on the few moments of black humor. Each time a brow-sweating bureaucrat or a confused politician worries about culpability, they decide to remand up to a higher authority. What results are elongated episodes of telephone which would be welcomed in a film resembling In the Loop (2009) or No Man's Land (2001). Yet in a film that injects liberal amounts of humanism, largely with the involvement of an innocent Somali girl, the humor feels out of place.

Thankfully if there is any cast who can pull off a film as morally ambiguous as Eye in the Sky without succumbing to farce, it would be this one. Aaron Paul makes a surprisingly nimble foil to Dame Helen Mirren's ready, able and willing Colonel. As he is the only person with a finger literally on the trigger, Paul's Lieutenant Watts is not only the most concerned about collateral damage, but ultimately the one who has to positively ID any victims of the drone's payload. Alan Rickman gives a penultimate performance as the General and by all accounts balances his humanity with his experience as a military officer. While the character seems to dilute under moments of frustration, he ends his performance with the most powerful line in the whole film. As for the always dependable Barkhad Abdi; the character's creativity and pragmatism not only serves an instant benefit to the plot but the physicality he brings to his performance elevates the noted character actor to one whose story I really want to see. Seriously Hollywood, give this guy the starring performance he rightfully deserves.

Eye in the Sky is a challenging, suspenseful and rewarding think piece that aptly utilizes it's talented cast. It tells the story of men and women who present nearly all the angles and algebra behind modern warfare in exhausting detail. While doing so, it does not insult its audience with clear heroes and villains but showcases a mosaic of humanity, warts and all. Grounded in realism and democratic in it's message, Eye in the Sky is a small movie in need of a large audience."

Permalink",False,"As this film was playing, I noticed that so many people in the audience were on the edge of their seats or clutching the person next to them...""Eye in the Sky"" is that gripping. Expertly directed by Gavin Hood (director of the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film, ""Tsotsi""), with an excellent story by Guy Hibbert as well as some amazing acting make this one of the best films of the year! Frankly...I was shocked how much I liked this film and the audience also seemed very pleased. This picture will be released widely in the coming weeks and I was fortunate enough to see it at the opening night gala at the Gasparilla International Film Festival in Tampa, Florida. With an opening night movie this good, expectations for the rest of the festival are very high.

The film is set during a very short time period...nearly the actual running time of the movie. It takes place around the globe...in The United Kingdom, Las Vegas, Hawaii as well as Kenya! And, as the action heats up, through expert editing the film works very well...and you feel as if you are there watching the politicians and military personnel as they make their decisions and consider all the consequences.

When the film begins, the Colonel (Helen Mirren) awakens from be in her home in Britain. She's an early riser and in the next scene, she's in a command center...looking over live surveillance footage being beamed to them from a drone flying over Kenya. At first, things seem pretty normal...and she and the folks in the US and Kenya are going about their jobs keeping an eye on some minor terrorists. However, suddenly the drone catches a glimpse of something very important...three of these people now under surveillance are among the five most wanted terrorists in the region...two Brits and an American who have converted to radical Islam. So the Colonel just orders the drone to take them out, right? Nope...not even close. Instead, it's like you have an up close seat to watch the struggle between politicians and military men and women who have very different objectives and senses of duty as they determine what to do next. You see the Colonel go up the chain of command and you realize that the wars of the 21st century are often fought by committee...even in the case of one drone attack. It's frustratingly slow and difficult. Soon, government ministers, prime ministers and generals (one of which is played by Alan Rickman in his final film) all get involved. And so, although they now all know that these bad folks are there, it takes nearly the entire film for the powers that bad make a decision. After all, this is in a city...and there's bound to be collateral damage. These decision makers are not caricatures but folks who struggle with what to do next...especially when they can see a small child standing close to the house...and firing would probably mean her death. In many ways, although the film is chock full of amazing current technology and gadgets, the film is about people...people with enormous decisions ahead of them. Sounds tense, huh? It gets worse...one of their micro-drones gets a peek inside...and two of the folks inside this compound are strapping bombs to their bodies and it looks like they are leaving soon! And, to just kill these people would take out civilians as well...there just doesn't seem to be any way around that, no matter how hard they try.

What I love about this film is that it really doesn't matter what your opinion is about the war on terror...the film has something for everyone. It provokes you emotionally, it makes you think about the morality of such warfare and it definitely knows how to push all the right buttons in the viewer. Never have I seen an audience so wrapped up in film as this one. I felt my chest tightening throughout and rarely have I felt tension build like it did in this one.

Following this film, the director, Gavin Hood, did a question and answer session. I found this incredibly revealing. The biggest shock to me is that in the movie, there are micro-drones that look almost like birds or insects...and are about the same size. According to Hood, this is a reality...and they managed to use some amazing CG to make it seem as if they were really using these high tech gadgets. Additionally, I was surprised to hear that he never got all the participants together and filmed many of the parts separately over a very long period and then pieced them together. This was done for practical reasons, as unlike many of Hood's recent films (such as X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Ender's Game), this was an independent film and had to be made on a much smaller. So, the production company was only able to get Ms. Mirren for a week...so they quickly shot these scenes. Later, Rickman and others were brought on board and their scenes were filmed later. And as for the American, British and Kenyan locations...they were all done in Hood's native land, in Cape Town, South Africa. Despite these shortcuts, there is nothing second-rate about the film. It looks great but more importantly its one heck of a wild ride! See this film...and I recommend you see it soon as a film like this works especially well up on a big screen."

Permalink",True,"The film is excellent in creating tension, the actors are top rate, the director is quite good, music too...for a FICTION it is fine. But we cannot separate this event apart from reality. And in this context the film is absolutely another thing. Come on...hours of deliberation about a military act, to save the life of one single person...who the hell do you think we are, who is going to eat this crap? No one I expect but as I see the overrated 7.3, it is obvious that the ""moral problem"" is at least, taken as ""real"" for most people. So if you enjoyed ""London has fallen"" or ""Rambo 3"" you can watch this film without contradictory feelings. But again...excellent realization. It is sad to see so many good actors involved in a complete lie. If you American people, have remorse for these kind of events, please do something OUTSIDE the films.

Permalink",True,"My notion of noir is the communication in a film story that the audience is the writer of the world, a world designed to satisfy our urges. Innocent victims are manipulated through coincidence and love. Since Welles, we've seen a great many variations and deep penetration in our film vocabulary. It is rare, for instance to not end a romantic comedy without a public, happy resolution of the love story in front of an audience, often involving an on screen camera.

Here we have what is now a mature version: the cameras are on screen cameras and the audience/writers are one community of characters while the manipulated innocents are another. I believe this was initiated by ""The Conversation,"" and refined in a spate of NSA-centric summer action things.

Here we have the typical formulation with the twist that we argue amounts ourselves about what to do. There are three layers.

The 'bottom' are the Africans. Within this group are indigenous and imported provocateurs who work to establish a story by force. At the 'top' is us in our role of manipulator, both as film audience with defined tastes and urges and as enabling citizenry of the machines in the stories.

In the middle is a very clever concoction of traditional noir vision and manipulation with debate about what to do. Our on screen folks (including the powerful Rickman) unfold a metastory about what has value in on screen action. This really is very well constructed, placing the center of tension not in the situation 'on the ground' (which indeed is tense) but in our own souls about what we countenance.

My unhappiness is the familiar one: I never feel so much a misogynist, jingoist, racist or hedonist as in films designed to creatively amplify those experiences behind the cover of critical distance. In this case, they pull the power of the moral ambiguity from my own mind where it should be eating me into the safe playground of film fiction. Seeing the familiar Rickman and here very actressy Mirren works against me, even me who has been close to people like those here. We are given the protection that fiction allows.

That said, I can recommend this straight up as an engaging film as well as near mastery of construction.

Permalink",False,"I was hopeful that Eye in the Sky would prove to be a really thought provoking movie. I sat through it and couldn't help, but think that I should have been enjoying it more.

The movie focuses on the mission to capture terrorists using various surveillance techniques. Various decisions need to be made about the mission which involves various senior people of British/Coalition forces. Helen Mirren plays Colonel Katherine Powell and isn't really that convincing in the role.

The main thing I found infuriating in the movie is that most of the characters seen (or unseen) seemed a little too stereotypical. The characters just didn't seem real, so everything came across a little flat. It was a good idea for a movie, just not quite executed properly.

Permalink",True,"I saw the previews of ""Eye In The Sky"" a few months back and at first I thought it looked interesting, and then I looked at some of the comments here on IMDb and cooled off to it because it seemed in retrospect in many ways fake and unrealistic.

Well, realism in this movie is not quite the point. The amazing technology in my opinion is like science fantasy, there to move the story along and tie different people's views and stories together who are scattered all around the world.

What this movie does is to bring home and to mind the results of the technological war we are now fighting with drones. A similar story could have been told in way about World War I and how the machine gun changed trench warfare, or WWII and heavy civilian bombings. The main theme is the effects of war on people who are just living their lives - and ""Eye In The Sky"" does this in a dramatic, creative and thoughtful way.

The one thing that I was thinking might have been added to the movie was a plot line about the terrorists, because all in all what you are left with is that this is a tragedy for everyone, all of them, on the side of the Western military world are doing their jobs while trapped in a huge system that removes their humanity and choice. So perhaps a reminder of the terrorists might have been warranted. They are absent, the ones who really cause this.

I gave the movie a high rating because it provokes thought, even if the technology and the exact scenario are of dubious nature.

Permalink",False,"Since 2008, around 2800 people have been reported killed in drone strikes. The vast majority of those strikes run up the chain of command and back down relatively quickly, and are carried out without hesitation.

But you'd never know any of that watching this film, where prominent, decorated, diplomats sit, white-knuckled, solemnly carrying out their duty to get a single drone-strike right. You may infer from the film that this happens commonly, or even for every strike. If that were the case, strikes would take up a significant amount of these poor people's time. The unusually high-level nature of this strike is never addressed.

Conveniently, the British have their finger on the trigger, not America. Conveniently, it's not the British Airforce pulling the trigger, but the American. So there's an international inversion happening that keeps this film from being important, valid or thought provoking.

A Non-American has to make the hard call and kill for the greater good, which lets us off the hook. Conveniently, the drone-operators, who are American, get to be the heroic conscience of the film. They just won't take the chance of accidentally killing a young girl. They're just too valiant and honorable. They stand up to the chain of command, but a Britt is at the top, which makes their act hollow and without statement.

The melodrama is so dishonest, so clearly politically manipulated, I am baffled that anyone would ever take this film seriously. Alan Moore once said the film V For Vendetta was made by ""people too timid to set a political satire in their own country."" Well this is a film about the American drone program that doesn't have the guts to discuss the American drone program. Five stars given for being exceptionally well made. Five stars withheld for being insultingly brazen propaganda."

Permalink",True,"If this film is meant as an apology for all the lies about the drone program and all the innocent lives taken, it's even more sickening than the drone war itself. No matter what good intentions the creators of Eye In the Sky must have had whit this story, it just won't do. It is totally unrealistic, and if the film is supposed to ease any kind of remorse, where's the point? There isn't any, simply because the plot is unreal.

(Spoiler>) In the film the drone controllers have a view over the action area that is better than what you get with a small drone flying 20 meters above ground. In reality the personnel behind the stick and monitors can't see if there's a little girl selling bread on the corner. And the beetle micro drone, how sweet. Neither do several ministers and a staff of personal advisers sit around and make the decision every time an enemy is to be eliminated by a rocket from a drone. Only during 2012 and 2013 there were 121.000 targets eliminated worldwide in the US drone program alone. Do anyone think that the foreign secretary, or any other minister or general for that matter, has to be asked for clarification every time?

I have a feeling that this is just stupid propaganda, and if so it's really annoying to see good actors wasting their time on it.

Permalink",False,"A stunning movie. Surely one of the best I've seen this year, certainly in the top 10, or even the top 5. It deeply delves into the military and political processes underlying drone warfare, but does so in a highly dramatic and highly personal way by focusing on one instance of use, told from the points of views of all those involved, both directly and indirectly (that is, those who will be labeled as ""collateral damage""). What is equally stunning to me is that I accidentally stumbled across this movie, had heard nothing about it until I saw it listed here on Amazon Prime. That the movie has not been in the front of public discussion (both cinematic and political discussion) is alarming, actually, for that indicates how little thought is being given to the this major change in warfaring strategy and its impact on both the military people executing it and the human beings directly impacted. It is superb in every way: the writing, the acting, the directing, the producing, the camera work, etc. I highly recommend the movie to everyone.

Permalink",False,"From what I gathered, this movie was trying to lecture and question morality; however, in my opinion, it misses and fails. It started out as something thrilling and then it got dragged on way too long that toward the end, I have lost complete sympathy on whatever the story was trying to convey.

In another words, it is ridiculous. Basically, they were debating between ""sacrifice little now to prevent future disasters"" and ""save little now and then deal with the disasters what may lie in the future."" I find that is ridiculous is not because I think there is an obvious choice that is by far feasible, that is because it is pointless. I find it illogical that some ppl try to value one person's life more than others. I find it ridiculous that some ppl try to justify innocence as something more and it is trite to use innocence to buy sympathy. We are in war. Why do ppl question morality or decency in war? One way or other, ppl die. If that little girl was a 40 yr old man, would it change? I think it would.

The movie is too shallow to amuse avid movie goers."

What cost a human life?

Is it ever worth killing 1 innocent person to save possibly 80?

This is called collateral.

This film explores the moral questions of such an action but from a British perspective.

Slow but on purpose to add to the outside and suspense which actually kept me on the edge of my seat in a number of places.

What would you choose to do if you had the choice, kill 1 innocent child to save 80 others, sitting there reading this the choice might seem simple but this film takes you along the journey of decision.

Great watch, great story.

Permalink",True,"The three elements necessary for a good picture are a good plot, excellent acting and notable character development. Even if one of those elements is missing, a film can still garner quite respectable ratings. This is the case with Gavin Hood's thriller, Eye in the Sky, which I liken to Hitchcock's Rear Window in that most of the exciting action is viewed from a distance by the protagonists.

A multinational force consisting primarily of Brits and Americans are one step ahead of a bunch of Al-Shabaab terrorists who are plotting another one of their nasty deeds in a safe house in Nairobi, Kenya. The action outside the compound is captured by a telescopic surveillance camera inside a drone which surreptitiously hovers over the bad guys high above in the atmosphere.

The principal good guy is British Army Colonel Katherine Powell played by the magisterial, tough-as-nails thespian, Helen Mirren, who is bent on capturing a British national turned terrorist who is the significant other of one of the Al-Shabaab miscreants. Powell ends up depending on undercover Kenyan field agent Jama Farah (played by the reliable Barkhad Abdi of Captain Phillips fame) who employs two wonderful miniature surveillance drones in the form of a hummingbird and what appears to be some kind of flying insect.

When Farah's ""insectothopter"" confirms that the terrorists are about to launch a suicide mission replete with suicide vests strapped to the bodies of their agents, Powell realizes this is no longer a ""capture"" mission but now decidedly one to ""kill."" In charge of the missile attached to the drone are US Air Force soldiers located at the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada.

Right before the USAF team is about to blow the terrorists to kingdom come, a young girl sets up a small stall selling loaves of bread right outside the compound. A debate then ensues between Powell and some of the civilian government officials in the room as to whether they can legally launch the attack since the probability of the girl being killed is high.

The late Alan Rickman (in his final role) is excellent as Lieutenant General Frank Benson who must contend with the warring factions who disagree completely as to whether the strike should be launched. It's almost comical in the way the buck is passed from one higher up to another including the British foreign secretary and the US Secretary of State (the contrast between the British and the Americans is quite clear with the Americans taking an aggressive posture toward dealing with the terrorists).

Powell finally asks Sergeant Mushtaq Saddiq (Babou Ceesay), the Risk Assessment Officer, to fudge the statistics and give her an under 50% probability rating that the girl won't be killed. He reluctantly gives her the figures that she wants and they go ahead with the strike.

SPOILERS AHEAD: In a realistic no-so-happy ending, the girl is killed along with the all the terrorists in the compound.

In addition to the visuals of the terrorists observed from afar, there is some exciting footage of the Kenyan field agent, running from the terrorists after his cover is blown and then attempting to save the young girl by having another child buy the last of her bread so that she'll leave the area.

Eye in the Sky has the two of the aforementioned three elements I alluded to before: excellent acting and a nifty plot which will keep you glued to your seat. There isn't much time for anything more so the characters (including Mirren's Powell) have virtually no back story and are not really fleshed out as multi-dimensional human beings. Still, this is a film which should definitely be on your list to see soon.

Permalink",True,"This is a gripping movie that is completely contrived and bares no connection to reality. I suppose it's an admirable effort to display the dilemma faced when killing terrorists with drones. The decisions that have to be made vis-a-vis civilians and collateral damage are played out here. Unfortunately, it's so phony at times. The technology is all wrong. The mini-drones don't exist and the real drones capabilities are misrepresented. The whole 'little girl selling bread' scenario that's central to the story certainly pulls the heart strings, except it's fake. The politicians are played like cartoon characters, whilst the military types don't ring true. You have to understand the military culture to know that a second lieutenant would not question the orders of a colonel, especially when ordered to 'engage'. Having said that, it kept me on the edge of my seat. I wanted to know the outcome.

Permalink",False,"I wanted to see this film the minute I saw the trailer. I have started really getting into war films and political films. Then Alan Rickman died and I really really wanted to see this film.

Eye in the Sky is about how complicated the chain of command is for making a single decision. Not that deciding to drop a bomb from a drone on to a house filled with terrorists should be an easy decision. However, it was eye-opening on just how complicated it is. From Steve (Aaron Paul) the American drone pilot waiting for the order to come from his commanding officer, A British woman named Colonel Powell (Helen Mirren), who is waiting for the order to come from Lt. General Benson (Alan Rickman), who is sitting in a room with the political officials in the American and British government. However, things get even more complicated when Steve notices a little girl selling bread could be a casualty. Now everyone is hesitating. Some hesitate because they fear for the girl's life, some hesitate because they fear the PR implications of killing the girl or fear the PR implications of not killing the terrorists, and some people do not want any part in this decision and keep passing the puck.

Several times I turned to see my mother mumbling on the edge of her seat just wanting them to make a decision. It only took me about a minute to realize this was not going to end well, which is not a spoiler as it's kind of a given with the subject matter. All the same, if I had to describe this film in one would I would say ""Suspense"". We just keep waiting and waiting and waiting, and then something little happens like the government using spies to buy the girl's bread to get her to go home, which does not go according to plan.

I think many walked into this film thinking it was going to be about criticizing drone strikes, but I do not actually think that's what this film is about. Sure it is about the extensive time, planning, and orders needed to fire a single drone. Sure you could argue that it's about spies and using video drones in the shape of flies and birds to get clear video of terrorists creating bomb vests and sitting around a pile of guns. Yet, I would have to say the ultimately, this film is just about the game of steps. You know, one step forward and three steps back. Going around in circles trying to find the center.

War should not be easy, but–naively so–I do wish stopping the bad guys was easier than it is. I do wish we weren't so concerned with the perception of an action, but in a world that is always watching that is never possible. I know the film is called ""Eye in the Sky"" and it is referring to the drone and the images used to put this strike in action; however, I think it's more about how everyone is watching. We're watching terrorists without being able to stop them. We're watching politicians with their own agendas who think they can logically make a military decision without thinking like a soldier. We're watching civilians who live in war zones and we're watching people who are torn between doing what they know is right and doing what they know they'll be able to explain to others later.

Was I a little more emotional in this movie because I knew it was the last time I was ever going to see Alan Rickman act? Sure. Yes, he was one of my all-time favorite actors, and no, it's not just because I'm a Potterhead. I liked his other films too. But it's more than that. This is an important subject no one wants to talk about, which is of course why we made a movie about it instead.

I think it was good, I feel like I learned something, but at the end of the day I still feel like I don't understand anything. Welcome to war and politics."

Permalink",False,"What I liked best about the film is how it exposes the logical vs. illogical nature of the arguments for and against drone strikes against Islamic fanatics intent on killing those who don't submit to their will. The acting is superb, and the scenes of drones flying about their targets is unlike anything I've seen before.

It would be wonderful if more movies like this were made, movies that touch on subjects that are real, contemporaneous and highly relevant. One can only wish, if only the Hollywood studios directed a fraction of their budgets away from the superhero nonsense that is so often served nowadays, and instead focused on serious films like this.

I would have taken the shot in the first 3 minutes of the movie, instead we get a 2 hour long drawn out discussion between people who have no clue how to defend their own country and protect scores of innocent people abroad.

This movie is a terrible piece of propaganda for people that cry and scream if we so much as define the enemy let alone try to defend ourselves. If everybody thinks like the actors portray in this movie, we have already lost.

The political hierarchical conversations were disgracefully inaccurate and it's crap like this that convinces me Hollywood will make anything to make a buck. I'm disappointed to see so many good actors agree to be in this movie especially Alan Rickman...I hope this wasn't his last film before he died...but I will say his last line in the movie may have been the only one worth the film it has recorded on.

Permalink",False,"A British military operation is using an American Hellfire drone to target a suspected al-Shabaab group in Nairobi and we're reminded that this terrorist group was responsible for the mass killing at the Westgate Shopping Mall in that city a few years earlier. OK, you have my attention - my son relocated to Kenyan's capital almost a year ago for his work, I've visited the city twice now, and on each occasion been to Westgate.

The operation is focused on a district of Nairobi called Eastleigh which is predominately inhabited by Somalis and known as 'Little Mogadishu"", although the film was actually shot in South Africa, the home country of director Gavin Hood. I'm not sure that Eastleigh is as lawless as it is represented or that we have the micro-surveillance technology depicted but, in both cases, this aspect of the narrative serves to heighten the military and moral choices and the legal and political considerations facing all those in the ""kill chain"" of command and underlines why so many of the characters in that chain constantly ""refer up"".

To some extent, we have covered this ground before, as two years ago we had ""Good Kill"" which showed the pressures on an American drone pilot. But ""Eye In The Sky"" is different in three main respects.

First, it shows one mission in a straight narrative told in near real time through a variety of technologies which creates a real sense of immediacy and tension.

Second, we see the issues from multiple viewpoints including that of the British colonel in charge of the operation (the brilliant Helen Mirren), her point man in Whitehall's COBRA room (the last performance by the late Alan Rickman), the drone pilot (American actor Aaron Paul), the man on the ground in Eastleigh (Somali actor Barkhad Abdi who was so impressive in ""Captain Phillips""), and various British and American politicians and advisers (the Brits shown as vacillating and the Yanks as gung-ho).

Third, in a dialogue-heavy script, British writer Guy Hibbert offers no easy answers, constantly shifting the viewer's inclinations one way and another, thereby emphasising that there is no straightforward trade-off between the chances of averting a terrorist outrage with the likely multiple loss of life against the algorithmic percentage estimates of collateral damage (that is, loss of innocent lives).

This is not a comfortable film to watch, but it raises serious questions in a manner that manages to be gripping and forces the viewer to think hard."

Permalink",True,"This crap soup is all about how US military uses its technology to help the righteous and how compassionately and responsibly it behaves when using drones.

One grandma Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren), with a severe handicap in decision making, is the US military general heading a drone operation for the benefit of some other country (UK).

She can't take even simplest of decisions. She whines, makes faces and puts up expressions as if she has pain in her gut.

She has some high-tech command centre with huge screens showing drone live images that rival Discovery Ultra HD programs; Also, some spies who have a high-tech van and bird and fly gadgets that can capture stunning 4K live images and a Kenyan general who relays orders from grandma to his own spies.

And she has a chain of subordinates for relaying orders to drone pilots, but in the end, she decides to call the pilot herself.

She is in contact with a bunch of Advisers, also with severe decision-making skill impairment, from UK who co-operate with her in some terrorist killing operation of UK. I don't know why another country is even involved in this soup of crap.

These Advisers frequently fight among themselves, contradicting themselves like teenage girls. If they fail to come to any conclusion they contact their Foreign secretary Ser Jorah Mormont

This FS, (Ser Jorah Mormont) has health issues, attends weapons fairs, and speaks to those bunch of Advisers over his cute china phone.

How is she in contact with Advisers? - using a laptop with secure connection with a horrible messenger that has 1960s UI to make us believe that it is a secure channel && 'also on her personal mobile phone'. Forget logic.

Now the crux of the story:

There are some terrorists in Nairobi, guarded by 100-200 armed body guards with AK47s and gun trucks.

US army grandma uses robotic fly that can be controlled by a PSP, high tech facial recognition that can scan faces from any angle to determine who the person is, reaper drones, spies with high-tech van, bird etc., and gets to know that these are indeed terrorists and that they are having tea in their home and that these terrorist bosses fancy wearing explosives..Wow! Cool tech huh!

Once confirmed, grandma calls up the Advisers and also pings them using her messenger and asks for their permission to kill the terrorists..

She asks them - What should we do? we found your terrorists..should we strike? No? Should we wait till the terrorist's chairs warm up? We need decision right now because they started wearing explosives !! OMG!!

These Advisers debate- Whether they want these terrorists captured alive or killed.. one hour debate! In the end, they ask grandma - Can these terrorists be caught alive by your high-tech drones? She pings back - No and calls them up and says 'No' Again they debate for an hour..to say 'Strike' or 'Don't Strike'.

Their answer - Wait, we can't decide. We just watch porn on our laptops. Decision is to be taken by our PM or a foreign secretary who has food poisoning (Forget protocol) and who is out to attend some weapons carnival instead of sitting with us!

Apart from all this high drama,

There is one cute little Kenyan girl with a loving father who fears his neighbor radicals but decides not to shift their home and a mother who makes bread and asks this little girl to sell the bread instead of sending her to a school.

This little girl takes the bread basket, puts up a stall adjacent to these terrorists' home that is surrounded by hundreds of vicious terrorists guarding it, instead of a market place.

Crap starts...

Drone hovers over the terrorist home and stays in one position in mid air all along the film giving pilots Ultra HD 4k images.

Drone pilot spots this little girl on his screen! He forgets every other thing that is in or near the house - girl, boy, dog or pig. He calls up grandma and says he can't do it unless they move the girl!

He invokes some right of his and some more crap follows. In the end, he says he won't strike.

Grandma says okay and again contacts those bunch of Advisers. They discuss - They would have negative publicity if that girl gets killed and their reviews and ratings would go down and they may get 1 star!

So they again contact grandma and tell her to do something. She asks her spy who plays with the PSP fly to get that little girl out of that area and forget the rest.

He risks his life to get the girl out, by buying her wares. Some action follows and in the end, he is unsuccessful with terrorists on his tail.

Now again grandma calls up --> Advisers who call up --> Foreign secretary who says --> Ask UK PM or POTUS --> grandma thinks of taking decision - we will take the risk and mourn the girl as causality!

The girl goes away the place and comes back on and off creating a sort of enigma.

The previously disobedient pilot strikes; the building is in smithereens; and the girl is badly wounded and is taken to hospital where she dies. Pilot gets depressed and weeps, grandma looks constipated and crap ends!

Bottom line - US military cares a lot about everyone even in drone strikes.

Permalink",False,"This is one of the cleverest and most unique thrillers I've seen in a while. On the one hand, it delivers brilliantly in giving you 104 seriously nail-biting minutes, but on the other, it's a film that really makes you think hard about the ethics, politics and consequences of war.

In comparison to the normal Hollywood thriller, this is a much more reserved take on the genre. So, rather than following secret agents or soldiers right in the middle of battle (although there are some seriously cool MI6 gadgets), we follow the people behind the scenes, and see everything that goes behind making an important decision in conflict.

That alone was really interesting to see, and with a fantastic cast portraying characters from all over the world that spend the entire movie effectively debating whether to push the button or not, you get an intriguing and amazingly engrossing insight into the world behind wars.

The way that this film plays out is fantastic too. It's not necessarily a high-octane thriller, but it's so effective at creating tension and suspense that you're on the edge of your seat within the first twenty minutes, and then you're there for the rest of the movie, making this one of the most consistently exciting and engrossing movies I've ever seen.

However, the reason that I think Eye In The Sky stands out so much as a brilliant film is because of how intelligent it is. Its screenplay is brilliantly written, and it manages to deliver the high intensity of this situation mostly through dialogue, but it also puts you, as the viewer, right in the hot seat on whether pulling the trigger is the right decision.

You'll inevitably have your own view as the situation begins to unfold, and I felt fully convinced that I was right about what should happen. However, this film challenges you brilliantly by introducing points of view from all across the political and military spectrum. It doesn't present the idea that one decision is necessarily the best, but instead gives you all the possible solutions to the desperate situation with the clock ticking, and leaves it up to you to decide what should happen, a puzzle that I absolutely loved trying to solve as the film developed.

Overall, I was really impressed by Eye In The Sky. Not only is it a well-made thriller that's hugely exciting to watch, but it's also a brilliantly intelligent film that gets you thinking hard for its entire duration, pulling you deeper and deeper into the situation at hand, which was absolutely thrilling to experience."

Permalink",True,"Eye in the Sky (2015): Dir: Gavin Hood / Cast: Helen Mirren, Aaron Paul, Alan Rickman, Barkhad Abdi, Jeremy Northam: Tense and suspenseful war film about that protective watch that cannot always surpass the chaos. Helen Mirren gives a commanding performance as Colonel Katherine Powell who is a military intelligence officer overseeing a mission where she view surveillance footage in Nairobi, Kenya where suicide bombers prepare in a safe house. Aaron Paul plays drone pilot Steve Watts who is awaiting orders to strike until camera picks up a young girl entering the disaster location to sell bread. Alan Rickman plays Lieutenant General Frank Benson whose first appearance has him purchasing a doll. From there he struggles in a back and forth phone dialogue between Powell and those whom she seeks strike approval from. Barkhad Abdi steals scenes as an agent on the ground location who uses camera drones shaped like birds and bugs that he controls. Tension strikes when he is interrupted by a kid believing that he is playing a game. He is also summoned to buy all of the young girl's bread in order to get her away from the disaster location but he is spotted and flees the scene. One complaint is an ending tragedy that really didn't need to happen that perhaps brings a false impression. Otherwise the drone effects are creative and the action is convincing as the threat grows more relevant. It demonstrates the details within these missions and the frustrations that emerge when plans are interfered with due to natural forces that come into play. That gives a detailed eye under life's darkest clouds. Score: 8 / 10

Permalink",False,"Ethan Hawke did a movie a few years back called Good Kill that was also about An Air Force drone pilot program. It was a more personal look at what stress can do to a pilot in this new war tactic. Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad fame plays the same type of character, only in the beginning of his career, as he's about to go on the toughest mission yet.

It's a far bigger look at the military tactics, the legal challenges and the political drama that happens in modern day Warfare. Helen Mirren plays a British General on a mission to capture a UK citizen who has been hanging out with Terrorist and uses a U.S Air force drone to find and confirm their whereabouts, but wen they discover the terrorist are making a bomb jacket, The General wants to change the mission in order to stop them, but it gets complicated.

It's an inside look on the bureaucracy that is war, and all the hoops that need to be jump through to make things happen. Mirren as the General is head of the mission and head of the ensemble cast. She was brilliant on showing how a modern age general works, in developing strategies in the war room.

It was a very brilliant ensemble cast she leads as well, which includes the late Alan Rickman. It's sad to know that this would be his final role, as he was simple yet brilliant on the screen, like a master craft man should be.

Eye in the Sky was a good spy movie, that shows how advance we have become in technology. Its surprising to me that everything in the movie use to gather intel is done for real.

And it's very suspenseful. There were scenes in which the General had to wait for her legal team and a bunch of politicians to make up their minds, and despite no one getting shot at or blown up I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens next.

Also, a tear jerker. It exploits a weird concept of a happy ending, but that's the grim truth of war, which is done realistically.

Really good. Hope it gets an Oscar nod or something."

Permalink",False,"Eye in the Sky is a movie about a drone strike operation in Nairobi, Kenya. Colonel Katherine Powell(Helen Mirren) is the chief military officer for this mission. The objective of the mission is, to capture some of the most wanted terrorists of Kenya. This mission is executed with the help of, Lt. General Frank Benson(Alan Rickman), Lt. Colonel Ed Walsh(Gavin Hood) & drone pilots, Steve Watts(Aaron Paul) & Carrie Gershon(Phoebe Fox). There are also government officials from the US and England who are supervising the operation. They are, Jack Cleary(Francis Chouler), George Matherson(Richard McCabe), Angela Northman(Monica Dolan) & James Willett(Iain Glen). The operation takes an unexpected & grave turn when a little girl named, Alia Mo'Allim(Aisha Takow) enters the kill zone of the missile about to be sent by the drone. This causes an international dispute about, whether to make the morally right decision or, to make the militarily correct decision.

Eye in the Sky is a fantastic film. The movie is a drama at its center but, it is also a thriller that will have the audience on the edge of their seat. The shocking climax of the movie, will move you to tears. The original script by Guy Hibbert is mind blowing. Director Gavin Hood's skillful direction, perfectly portrays the tense vibes among the entire group involved with the operation. This is Gavin Hood's best film as a director & is a complete change from the tent-poles(X-Men Origins: Wolverine[2009], Ender's Game[2013]) he normally helms. The performances are the highlight of the film. Helen Mirren is outstanding as Colonel Katherine Powell. Mirren effortlessly portrays, Powell's military nonchalance. Aaron Paul gives the best performance of his career as Steve Watts. Paul portrays Watts' increasingly emotionally distressing plight, with grace & aplomb. Alan Rickman gives another flawless performance as Lt. General Frank Benson. Rickman adds some much needed humor to the proceedings. Alan Rickman was one of the best actors of his generation & he will be missed, dearly. Barkhad Abdi is great as Jama Farah. Phoebe Fox is brilliant as Carrie Gershon. Gavin Hood is impressive as Lt. Colonel Ed Walsh. Francis Chouler, Richard McCabe, Jeremy Northam, Monica Dolan & Iain Glen are good as Jack Cleary, George Matherson, Angela Northman & James Willett, respectively. Last but definitely not the least, Aisha Takow is spectacular as Alia Mo'Allim. Eye in the Sky is a must watch for everyone.

Permalink",False,"The idea for many people behind drone striking is that is a more clean, safe, and dehumanizing way of targeting ""enemies"". ""Eye in the Sky"" plays to the convention and offers a very interesting view of the people behind those strikes.

Mission: capture a group of terrorists Location: Kenya Participants: United Kingdom, USA and Kenya (UK leading the mission)

What was in principle a mission to capture terrorists soon becomes much more than that as things don't go as intended. The terrorists are now hiding in a house, they seem to be getting ready to realize a terrorist attack, and just outside the house, a little girl is selling bread. What will the people watching from the security of their offices do? What decisions will they take?

""Eye in the Sky"" is a very good movie, that tries to humanize the people that take decisions, that have to choose what kind of outcome is the best. It also tries to offer a view of the people that live in those places that seem so far away to the Western viewer, like Kenya. It is a very cold movie, though, as it keeps a very detached atmosphere, not letting us forget what is really going on here: people deciding who deserves to live and die, and why.

It has a couple of little missteps, that bring it closer to an action movie and distract from the building tension. This is a movie not about people running or things exploding, it is about feelings, about decision-making, about what we have to take with us after every decision we make, the consequences of our acts.

The acting is top-notch. It helps when you have an amazing cast as the movie has, everyone offering the best of the best, even if their parts are small. The movie plays the ambivalence card very well, and gives us time to choose: how would we react in the same situation? What would we do?

It is a hard movie, and it is not easy to sit through knowing what it is really talking about, but it is absolutely worth watching."

Complicated as it may sound, the film has a very simple premise, that is, Should an innocent be a collateral damage for the sake of saving more innocents? Are casualties of war something inevitable? Helen Mirren perfectly acts out the dilemma that we believe in her character, the guy from the Breaking Bad magnificently embodies the dilemma as well!

For me, the main strength of this film was that it was one of those films that's made compellingly watchable by the fact that it just keeps building in suspense, continuously, until the end. You start small, little introductions to characters, then gradually layer upon layer of complication and tension is added. There's not one wasted beat or moment. I love films like this, Die Hard is another example.

Acting, writing, atmosphere, credibility was all just right for a two hour slice of tension building mayhem. Go see it.

Turned out it was a very long dramatization of a single incident, with military officials and politicians doing a >lot< of discussing and debating about potential collateral damage. I wound up fast forwarding through much of it, very boring.

The film pretends it's making some sort of statement -- but doesn't really say anything. It also doesn't entertain.

Permalink",False,"For a start I do not think it has anything to do with the fact that they used drones...this is just a moral on modern warfare.

Excellentley cast and superbly directed, this is as tense an affair as I have ever seen on the big screen.

It really takes you in to the feel of what happens in a war room ..things we hear about all the time brought to life in front of our very eyes.

The only irony is Alan Rickman in my opinion gives the performance of his life as a tired and war weary officer...reminding me of Jack Nicolason in A Few Good Men..but a lot better.

Catch this thriller at the theatre before it gets released on disc to take in the power of its cinematography. Movies like this need to be made to make us think about the insane world we live in.

All in all a masterclass in modern day cinema."

Permalink",False,"Gavin Hood's tense thriller, EYE IN THE SKY will be forever remembered as the last film that the great Alan Rickman completed before his death. That is too bad as this film should be remembered for what it is - a tense military, political thriller with 3 superb performances at the core.

EYE IN THE SKY tells the tale of Colonel Katherine Powell (the always great Helen Mirren) a British officer who has been trailing terrorists through surveillance in her high Security Bunker. She finally is able to locate 3 of the members of her most wanted list, with the aide of a drone pilot (Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul) who is located in his bunker in Las Vegas. She orders a drone strike, but Paul's pilot refuses to do so without ""higher authority"" because of collaterol damage. Enter Lieutenant General Frank Benson (Alan Rickman) who has to maneuver the legalities and the politics of this situation from his version of a bunker, a conference room.

This set up suggests that this movie is dialogue heavy, and it is. It could easily be a stage play, with the different areas of the stage serviing as the 3 bunkers. Consequently, it falls on the acting shoulders of the 3 leads to pick up the slack of this movie, and they do it well.

Director Hood was either good or lucky in getting veteran actor's Mirren and Rickman for their respective roles. They inhabit each character with the appropriate sense of urgency (Mirren) and politically savy (Rickman) while Paul's character is the baby-face of the group who holds onto his concerns with a tight grip.

The short, 1 hour 40 minute length of this film helps with the tension as we do not have time to linger on anything and have to make a decision and move on to the next thing in rapid order.

A tense, fast-paced movie with a moral quandary in it's center, EYE IN THE SKY is a rather nice send off for Mr. Rickman.

I, for one, will miss him.

7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"

Permalink",True,"Nobody said war was easy, even when it is made to look like a video game. Eye in the Sky tells the story of a drone strike with possible collateral damage. The collateral damage could be an innocent child we meet early in the story.

The movie stresses the need for rules of engagement so that officials way up the chain of command don't have to make decisions while on the toilet.

While you are thinking about the posed moral dilemma, the real head scratcher is how did the Barkhad Abdi, of Captain Phillips fame know the little girl would resell his spilled bread after he was driven into hiding?

Helen Mirren is excellent in a role originally written for a male. Alan Rickman gives an outstanding supporting performance and will be missed.

The movie works. It is tense and absorbing. It leaves you to ponder the nature of war. It looks good on the big screen and should be seen in a theater environment.

Rating: 4.7/5 stars

Exceptionally taut, nerve-wrackingly tense, and extremely timely, ""Eye in the Sky"" is backed by brilliant direction from Gavin Hood and all-round powerful performances to deliver a rivetingly cerebral and grippingly topical spin on the modern, wartime political thriller.

Colonel Katherine Powell (Dame Helen Mirren), a UK-based military officer in command of a top secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya, discovers through remote surveillance and on- the-ground intel that two of the world's most-wanted targets are planning a devastating suicide bombing, and the mission escalates from ""capture"" to ""kill"". But as American drone pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) is about to engage from his Nevada base-of-operations, a nine-year old girl enters the kill-zone triggering an international dispute over the moral, political, collateral, and personal implications of modern warfare, which reaches the highest levels of US and British government.

""Eye in the Sky"" can get quite disturbing upon first viewing, but as the dust settles down, quite literally at certain points, you realize just how balanced and ambivalent it is in separating right from wrong. Most of all, it's a very compelling film, offering the best elements of both a pertinent drama and suspenseful thriller. Thankfully, this is also one of those rare movies that doesn't make any excuse for the terrorists, and shows them for the scumbags they really are while also reasoning with the west's stance of eradicating them by any means necessary.

Yet, ""Eye in the Sky"" provides no easy answers, only tough questions about the harsh necessity of following orders and the bitter yet unavoidable reality of the cost of war, particularly in times such as these, and therein lies the brilliance of this wartime thriller – in making us think as much as it makes us chew our nails while delivering edge-of-the-seat suspense. It's an ethical and immersive film about the collateral damage and complexities of drone warfare. Hood directs the socks out of the movie, not letting the tension up for a moment throughout this nail-biter, which almost unfolds like a taut and concise stage play.

After eons I can unequivocally state that we've been dealt a real, riveting white-knuckle thriller to rank with the best of Hitchcock. I'd be shocked if this doesn't make most critics' ten best by the year end.

But after ten minutes, once the mission and issues became clear, it was one of the most riveting film experiences I've ever had.

This picture should be required watching for students everywhere. The questions it raises are essentially unanswerable, yet, essential to the idea that any modern society can call itself ""civilized."" The performances are beyond superb.

Alan Rickman's final performance on the big screen is extraordinary. Nuanced. Complex. Perfect. Of course.

Permalink",False,"When someone makes a movie about a controversial and emotionally-charged subject, many Movie Fans will view and evaluate the film through the lens of their personal beliefs on that subject. However, if a movie is made well enough that it doesn't have an obvious point of view, or try to push a certain agenda, and its script and direction give a fair hearing to both sides of the argument, then it does what movies do best – generate intelligent thought and meaningful discussion. This is what the British drama ""Eye in the Sky"" (R, 1:42) does for the topic of drone warfare – while still managing to be entertaining.

Nairobi, Kenya. Intelligence reports reveal the probable whereabouts of two or three highly-placed members of East Africa's Al-Shabbab terrorist organization. British Military Intelligence Officer, Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren), is in charge of a small military unit which is remotely monitoring the terrorists' movements, as she advises her superior, Lieutenant General Frank Benson (the late Alan Rickman, in his final on-screen performance). Benson is in a separate location, also monitoring the operation, with a few high-ranking members of the British government. This is a mission to capture terrorists, to be carried out by Kenyan military forces. All these groups are relying on their ""eye in the sky"", an unmanned drone remotely piloted by U.S. Air Force 2nd Lieutenant Steve Watts (Aaron Paul), working with Senior Airman Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox) in a small metal building on Nellis Air Force Base (not specifically named, but the most likely location given the script's references to Las Vegas).

That UAV isn't the only visual feed in this scenario – and that's where things get complicated. Jama Farah (Barkhad Abdi, in his first post-""Captain Phillips"" film role), an undercover operative, is controlling a beetle-like device which is outfitted with a tiny camera and can fly into the house without being noticed by the house's occupants. Farah's video feed confirms that three long-sought-after high-value terrorist targets are inside that house but that's not all. This surveillance shows the terrorists outfitting two men with suicide vests, which each have pockets filled with a large number of pipe bombs. That revelation turns this capture mission into a kill mission. Most of the players are onboard with the change in mission, until a young girl is spotted selling bread a few yards from the targeted house. Her presence, and the developments that follow, trigger a series of discussions among peers, and up and down the U.K. and U.S. military and civilian command structures. As the window of opportunity for the UAV to fire its hellfire missiles shrinks and tensions grow, the military, political, legal and ethical dilemmas are considered, debated and anguished over in real time by soldiers and civilians on four continents.

""Eye in the Sky"" is a remarkable motion picture. The exceptional performances of this multi-national ensemble cast and the sensitive and well-paced direction of South African director Gavin Hood make for a quality film, while British screenwriter Guy Hibbert's script makes it an important film as well. Hibbert uses a situation that is unique in some of its details to explore the multiple aspects and complicated implications of the large, multi-faceted subject of drone warfare. The script is smart enough to portray the pros and cons of both sides of these arguments, while not clearly favoring either. No easy answers are offered and some questions are left unanswered. Unlike 2015's drone warfare drama ""Good Kill"", which made a show of presenting the pros and cons of drone warfare but was obviously very biased, ""Eye in the Sky"" seemingly examines the morality play from above, and refrains from passing judgment.

The story's resolution will please some audience members, while angering others, but few Movie Fans will cheer the outcome when there is just so much to think about. Regardless of a given viewer's reaction to this film, most will likely notice two things: (1) Western military and civilian officials at many levels care and work much harder to avoid killing innocents in the War on Terror than the other side does, and (2) No one on either side of the arguments presented in the film, or either side of this global struggle, walks away unaffected by the results of his/her actions. So, in the end, this movie does have a message or two to share, while its taut, thrilling portrayal of an engrossing story and its unflinchingly balanced presentation of important issues makes for an entertaining and thought-provoking film.

The role of the military, the indecision and CYA attitude of the politicians, and the moral drama of the drone pilots, this film includes every element of the war on terrorism. And the way the plot unraveled makes it also a great thriller. Another dimension which is very well illustrated is the fantastic technology which we now have to combat terrorism. This technology did inspire the title of the movie: ""eye in the sky"". And beyond the drones, the film also reveals some other form of smaller eye in the skies technology which requires closer contact from the operators, this constitutes another element of the drama.

THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.

IN BRIEF: A film that will cause some needed discussion about war and the lengths we will go to protect ourselves, even if the film lacks a balanced point of view.

GRADE: B

SYNOPSIS: Due to a high degree of civilians living near a terrorist group, military officials debate a mission, the bombing of a sleeper cell.

JIM'S REVIEW: War is hell. That's a given. With a winner-takes-all mentality and the combative nature of the military, is there room for any moral doubt about the growing casualties caused by war and its brutal outcome? Should the collateral damage ever exceed or interfere with the on-going mission? Do we readily accept the decision to kill for the good of mankind? Red flags and all sorts of honorable questions are raised and endlessly debated in Gavin Hood's seriously-minded war drama, Eye in the Sky.

The film tackles the issue of drone surveillance as a tool to stop terrorism at any cost. The scenario pits the good guys, in this case, an English colonel (Helen Mirren), an American pilot (Aaron Paul), and a British general (the late Alan Rickman) against evil African terrorists set on causing more carnage. From the start, there is much debate and talk between the members of the military, diplomats, and politicians about differing ways to approach the target, a sleeper cell in Kenya that is manufacturing bombs. As the film progresses, more evidence points to this target as a haven for terroristic activity. Ready...aim...fire...That is, until a sweet little girl walks into the line of fire near the intended site, causing moral ambiguities to come into play.

￼Now, right then and there, I suspended my belief as the film began to lose its grip on reality. The ethical quagmire never becomes a solid enough argument, especially with the military cast of characters involved. The philosophical conflicts plaguing the assembled parties should have made more of an impact to this reviewer, but did not. In Guy Hibbert's literate screenplay, co-authored by Mr. Hood as well, that is not the case and the filmmakers stack the deck when personalizing the toll of war by focusing on an innocent child and her loving family (who also show their disdain for the Islamic fanatics). Manipulative and effective, but also partisan and ill- balanced, the film ups the ante when the rules of engagement begin to change and a mission to capture the targeted extremists becomes a shoot-to-kill assignment with many lives at stake.

Yet Eye in the Sky makes many interesting points, especially with the behind-the-scenes encounters at various locales and the convoluted bureaucracy that works on an international scale to slow down the urgency in decision-making. Ethics and morals are frequent allies in this global battlefield and the film takes that message quite seriously, almost scoring a direct hit.

￼The actors are all fine, although they are given very little dramatic scenes to play. Mostly, everything is too restrained, factual, and introspective. The cast is expected to deliver their monologues and look grim as the situation unfolds, but they fortunately add more depth to their characters than merely being talking heads playing devil's advocates to each other. Particularly strong are Ms. Mirren (as always), Barkhad Abdi, and Mr. Rickman in his final screen role (what a talent, what a distinctive voice).

￼Eye in the Sky can camouflage itself however it wants, but it is foremost, an ethics lesson disguised as a war movie. Its credibility stretches the limits, giving way to a predictable but unflinching ending. The film is gripping and thought-provoking. It deserves an audience for its sheer courage at discussing the consequences of war in an adult and realistic manner.

Sadly, the average moviegoer should see this provocative film but will not. Nowadays, we need to be entertained, not disturbed. Comic book superheroes have replaced our real heroes. And the war goes on...

Permalink",False,"Diverting responsibility throughout, one avoids making a decision about a bombing which could kill several terrorists, but also could kill an innocent young girl nearby, and shifts responsibility to someone else, who repeats the process.

Minute details give the characters depth, but wisely handles everything seriously, avoids turning the plot into a comedy (one higher-up is taken sick, takes an important phone call while on the toilet, while Alan Rickman's character begins his day by trying to find the doll his daughter wants.) Alan Rickman, in his final on- screen performance, is top class as always. A fitting farewell, and the film is dedicated to him, ""In loving memory of Alan Rickman""

Kenyans show as much, or more, humanity than US, in the final scene, while filmmakers simultaneously show aftermath of war.

Permalink",True,"A terrorist cell is meeting in Kenya and is under drone surveillance. The original plan to capture cell members is revised when it becomes clear that they are preparing for suicide bombing: however, it seems likely that a missile strike will also claim the life of a nearby child: is the near certainty of an innocent collateral death a price worth paying to avoid the many deaths if a suicide bombing is successful? The military decision must wait for political clearance, but nobody actually wants to make the decision.

Unlike Good Kill, which concentrated on the psychological impact of drone killing on the drone pilots, Eye In The Sky concentrates on the ethics of drone killing, playing this out against the tense background of satellite images, and whether a little girl will sell her bread quickly. Helen Mirren, Aaron Paul, and Alan Rickman head the cast: all are excellent, as are the support cast. The sense of menace in the Kenyan community is palpable and the tension never lets up even though, for a lot of the time, nothing much actually happens (the brief action sequences are very well staged). And the moral issues stay in your mind well after the film has ended.

This is a thoughtful, intelligent, and gripping film.

Permalink",True,"Who knew that watching a little girl sell bread could be so tense? The morality of Drone warfare is a fairly new concept the modern day war films seem to yonder down, case and point being Andrew Niccol's 2014 film Good Kill. Eye in the Sky is a frustratingly thought provoking film about the prolonged search for an answer, as to whether out-of-the-loop politicians will allow a drone strike to commence as they take the law, propaganda and public image into account. My summary may give a negative opinion of this film, BUT it is quite the opposite. This is a good film.

The film in essence is a 100 minute debate on the morality of missile strikes. The film really delves deep into this dilemma and continues to add new obstacles into the mix to see how it may change things. Guy Hibbert's dialogue heavy screenplay was fantastic in bouncing from drone pilot to Chinese Ping Pong to Ian Glen taking a dump and to Alan Rickman's old white people room etc. Pieced together with Gavin Hood's direction, the reel time film's issue is handled immensely well and the sheer inability for anyone to make a decision and stick with it (except Mirren and Rickman) will certainly leave you frustrated and angry at the cowardliness on displayed by those who are supposed to do what's best.

The acting thought-out was great. Aaron Paul puts the meth to one side to operate a drone in the best film and film role he has had as of yet. Joining Jesse is Helen Mirren, who's determination to drop the missile is visible in every line she utters, boarding on the comical side at times as her patients grows thinner and thinner as the film proceeds. She was a bad ass who literally take no prisoners and shines in the role. And then there is the late great Alan Rickman to deliver one final great performance, which in my opinion, is the perfect send off for the thespian, made complete with a perfect closing line.

Eye in the Sky is a wonderfully tense and relevant film, it will aggravate you but that is Gavin Hood's intention as he firmly sides with Mirren and Rickman in this film. I really enjoyed this reel time political war film and am glad that Alan Rickman has this as one of his last films. The film has done him well. ""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war.""

Permalink",True,"Eye in the Sky is a stunning musing solemn flick! Amidst a world of chaos sat a girl trying to sell her bread. Unperturbed. Unaware. Heedless of an impending danger, carrying on with her regularity. She had no idea, centimeters away holed up in a safehouse concocted terrorists a plan to bring a bigger annihilation to fruition. A bunch of authorities watching them from the skies, like Gods, hold the handle to the trigger to take the terrorists down but are faced with a conundrum so lethal that could take an instant innocent life in the process of imminent pacification. Their act has no absolution. They have to live with the choice they make. So poetic! Right? From the enthralling head of Guy Ribbert comes a conscience tale that will throw your brains into pits of disarray where you will be compelled to live with the choices you make as life dependencies get entailed. What weighs more? It is something you will keep questioning throughout the flick's climax until the final call is made.

We see a political pandemonium go murky as people refer up for the Herculean decision that stares them in their eyes. It shows how incapacitated we are into making real life's choices. No one's spared. You wish to keep your slate clean and yet wish to do something good for the world. A soldier's life is a constant battle of what needs to be done against what is right. Eye in the sky is reflective of that very thought.

""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war."" As the movie progresses into a nail-biting finish you couldn't help but feel a pang of emotions erupt in your heart. So powerful is its vigour that it captivates you right from the moment it delves into storytelling.

Eye in the Sky is a decisive voyage that forces us to question our abilities. It has been well helmed by Gavin Hood with an endearing music to keep us company. The star cast is stellar as they pack in a powerful performance together as an ensemble. It has every element shoehorned in the perfect amount, right from the heartless, the hearty to the sentient. You see exceptional performances by Alan Rickman, Barkhad Abdi, Helen Mirren, Aaron Paul, Iain Glen and the beautiful young girl Aisha Takow. Powerful intense acting! A must-watch!

I am an admirer of Gavin Hood's work and he takes a relatively simple story and creates a taut tension with viable characters. To his credit he lets the story unfold in real time and some may say the pace is too slow. I certainly screamed in frustration, but for other reasons too!

I don't usually watch war films, but I'm glad I saw this, as it raises a number of salient points about drone warfare, government and the military. It's not a gung-ho movie, but an intelligent, thought provoking view of the casualties of war.

Permalink",False,"Very good film. Great performances all round, particularly from Mirren and Rickman. Starts off a little slow, but when the central conflict is underway it becomes one of the better war films in recent memory. Interesting moral dilemma at the core of the film that offers no easy answers. For much of the time the film encourages us to see the military leaders as the villains, until the end when the film gives us much greater insight into their motivations. A more intelligent and thoughtful war film than most viewers are used to I think.This is my review of a very good film.Solid little thriller. The last act was surprisingly quite tense. Good performances too

Permalink",False,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Eye in the Sky"" (2015) is superb thriller from start till finish. This is a movie which will keep on the edge of your seat during the whole time and will question some morality questions as well - did they did the right thing? In my opinion, absolutely.

Performances were superb by all involved. Directing as well as writing and editing are first rate - not a dragging second for a whole 1 h 32 min, it is a superbly involving thriller.

Overall, i loved the previous film ""Rendition"" by Gavin Hood - he should stick to this material and not to some pop corn flicks aka. ""Wolverine"" - ""Eye in the Sky"" is one of the years most simple and unforgettable thrillers that everyone will definitely should see. Great movie.

Permalink",True,"Helen Mirren stars with Alan Rickman and Aaron Paul in ""Eye in the Sky,"" a 2015 film.

Mirren is Colonel Katherine Powell, a military officer in the UK who handles drone operations in order to capture terrorists in Kenya.

Powell discovers that some hard-to-capture targets she has been trailing are in a house and planning a suicide bombing. Though the original mission was to capture these people -- as two are Americans and one is British -- Powell wants to destroy the house with them in it.

No one will take responsibility for making such a decision, so the situation is passed up the food chain until Powell finally gets the okay. She has a young pilot, Steve (Aaron Paul) on standby with his hand on the trigger and tells him to fire. As he's about to, a nine- year-old girl enters the kill zone to sell bread. Steve is reluctant to shoot, and a new discussion begins.

Again, no one wants to take responsibility for making the decision. Should they allow the terrorists to blow a shopping mall to kingdom come and kill as many as 80 people so that this little girl lives? Or do they save the lives of other children and adults by putting her in danger?

Very tense and disturbing film that moves quickly and will have the viewer completely involved. Naturally the little girl is a beautiful, lively child, and it tears at the heart to realize that something could happen to her.

The fascinating part of the film is the drone technology, a tiny flying bug that flies into the house and gives the viewer a picture of what's going on inside. There was also a hummingbird drone, and these actually exist. The big problem with the beetle drone is battery life, which was included in the film.

Helen Mirren as usual is wonderful as a tough woman - she'd have to be -- who understands what needs to be done and is used to the tough decisions.

Lt. Benson, in the government room with others trying to decide what to do, is portrayed by Alan Rickman in his last role (discounting voiceovers). It's a terrific part for him, and what a way to go out. When Angela Northman (Monica Dolan), who has been fighting the bombing, mocks Lt. Benson for making a decision sitting in his chair, he straightens up and tells her that although she sits around with her tea and biscuits, he has seen first-hand the result of suicide bombings, ending his speech with ""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war."" That scene is worth the entire film. What a legacy he left us.

Permalink",True,"Utilitarianism is the key concept. Unfortunately the film is overly obsessed with giving a balanced debate about modern western warfare. It felt a bit like a stage show to me as the staging of the scenes felt really cardboard and badly shot. Some of the military inside was interesting and watching the power play between military personnel and politicians was quite enlightening. Couldn't help but notice that the little girl that the whole films was based upon, had hardly a scratch on her once the bomb went off. Even when she died she still seemed peaceful and looks as if she fell in the mud and cut her head playing soccer. Think a lot of the reality of warfare was hidden and even though the film plays both sides of the field, it was still a bit of a soap opera about the hard decisions politicians have to make. Its mad clear that the political consequences were their greatest concern even if the decision to bomb was legal, but it is later said that nobody would find out and the military cover their tracks by giving false estimates on suspected civilian casualties. Well they were never concerned before the days of social media like some other reviewers pointed out, look at Iraq and Afghan or whats left of those countries. The politicians would just be worried their was a Kenyan near by with a smart phone. Another criticism would be we never meet the enemy. The only time we encounter them is through the eyes of a Micro RPA; it feels a bit like we are in a video game. Its understood that military personnel now operate weapons from remote locations so to lessen symptoms of PSD which is costing our health care system so much money, it feels like this film is doing this with the audience, creating a remote connection. Even if these people are radical crazy people wouldn't it be nice for them to have even have 1 minute of screen time so we can characterise them. In good time for the Chilcot enquiry.

Permalink",False,"Academy award winner Helen Mirren stars in a new thriller/war film by director Gavin Wood (Ender's Game, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) Mirren puts on a military outfit and plays the role of Col. Katherine Powell, a military officer in command of an operation to capture terrorists in Kenya by using remote surveillance/drones.

The movie starts with Col Powell (Helen Mirren) starting her day early, waking up just before her morning alarm kicks in. She turns on her computer and we are all provided with the news and urgent action required for her day. Of course Col Power isn't alone- she is required to work and consult with many other characters within the film's duration including Lieutenant General Frank Benson (Alan Rickman) & Drone pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul from TV Series hit ""Breaking Bad"")

Once the story is set up, the film provides great amounts of tension that never stops- the plot is a real draw card. Many of our main characters are required to discuss situations before further action can be conducted. Along with this, they have to deal with political and legal protocols, also discussing situations further with higher military leaders.

The mission escalates when a young girl enters the kill zone, triggering an international dispute over the implications of modern warfare.

Questions are now raised: can this situation now be classed as a ""capture"" or ""kill""? This film keeps you thinking as each new situation is updated. Many twists and turns are taken as the clock Ticks and Tock's. This can have the audience very tense (maybe even frustrated) throughout the film. I personally found myself sitting on the edge of my seat until the credits started to roll down the screen.

The acting in Eye Of The Sky is superb, particularly from both Helen Miriam and Alan Rickman (who will be deeply missed as this is Alan Rickman's last performance)

""In war, truth is the first casualty""

It's all about a difficult drone strike decision the military has to make, as well as the bureaucratic red tape they have to cut through. The entire movie is focused on one event, too, practically in real time, so don't expect a lot of action - it's more about the threat of violence instead of actual violence.

Permalink",True,"'Eye In The Sky', in a nutshell, is a honed-to-near-perfection example of how to tell a deeply intricate story with multiple players and narratives without losing or confusing those who are watching (even with all its military acronyms and terms). The film really stresses to its audience through careful camera-work, writing and dialogue how difficult the sorts of situations shown are.

The editing is also very well done, and weaves the narrative together almost effortlessly, cutting between various viewpoints and characters in a way that demonstrates how world-spanning and desperately important this military operation is; again, all while keeping the audience focused on the tense action at hand. In addition, this is assisted largely by the actors (all of whom perform extremely well); particularly Aaron Paul, who is able to showcase his talents as the U.S. pilot being pushed to his moral limits.

The main criticisms of this film are the pacing feeling uneven at times, the repetition of some shots and some of the CGI and other visual effects being noticeably distracting - as well as a few plot inconsistencies e.g. If allowing the terrorists to perform a suicide bomber attack means the ""good guys"" (the not-terrorists) win the so-called ""propaganda war"", wouldn't the missile strike allow the terrorists to win this so-called war, considering the possible civilian casualties of the local population and the death of the little girl, Alia - making locals and others perhaps feeling sympathetic towards the terrorists' cause?

8/10 (Not quite 9/10 due to aforementioned issues)

Permalink",False,"'Eye in the Sky's' main attraction was not for me the fascinating subject. It was not because of my love for the genre. It was because of the immensely talented cast, Helen Mirren, Alan Rickman, Barkhad Abdi and Aaron Paul have been great and more in other things, with my main reason for seeing 'Eye in the Sky' being Rickman in his final screen role before his ultimely death two years ago from pancreatic cancer (a loss still very deeply felt).

While not a flawless film as such, and it has proven to be a film that has polarised viewers, 'Eye in the Sky' is truly impressive. There are many fine things and its best elements are superb. What some have found heavy handed, dull, dubious morally and one-sided, was to me a film that was gripping, tense and one that approached its subject matter intelligently and strived not to be too conventional or too simple. Can totally understand the polarisation though, it's a controversial subject in the first place and it was always going to be very hard for any film how to approach it, 'Eye in the Sky' does this well.

Maybe the sentimentality towards the end is a touch too much and maybe the message was hammered home a little too thickly.

Otherwise, there was nothing to fault 'Eye in the Sky'. Where it most excels is with the casting, with Helen Mirren being cast against type and doing so with authoritative steel. Aaron Paul is as great as he was in 'Breaking Bad' and Barkhad Abdi shows his versatility in a role different to the one he had in 'Captain Phillips'. Alan Rickman however gives the best performance, he is commanding and splendidly droll and there was an element of poignancy too knowing that it was his last performance.

The film has nail-biting tension and suspense, unfolds deliberately but never dully (was actually on the edge of my seat the whole time) and was never hard to follow while not ever getting simplistic. It made a real effort to be balanced and handles a difficult subject with tact and intelligence, with it not overdoing or trivialising the full impact of the situation and bravely not falling into clichéd genre tropes or providing easy or over-convenient answers. The main point and moral is generally made effectively. The script is thoughtful and well written and some of the film is also very heartfelt and brings a lump to the throat.

It is a very well made film visually, having the right amount of grit and stylishness and capturing the claustrophobic confinement of the setting with authenticity. The direction is always at ease with the material and doesn't lose control or let go.

Although, truly impressive. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

Permalink",False,"A British military operation works with the U.S. and Kenya to prevent a suicide bombing by known terrorists in Nairobi. The efforts for a drone attack are thwarted as an innocent nearby civilian could possibly be killed in the attack.

""Eye in the Sky"" is neither pro-war nor anti-war. Or maybe it could be called both. The various arguments on all sides are compelling and credible. The viewer feels as conflicted as most of the characters in the film.

There are two characters who have no qualms on where they stand. On one side is a British military colonel (Helen Mirren) who believes the attack should go ahead regardless of civilian casualties. On the other side is a British political official (Monica Dolan) who believes there must be no risk at all of civilians being killed. (Interestingly, these characters never confront each other.) In between is everyone else in the military, political and legal spectrums who debate the dilemma: is it okay for a small number of innocents to be killed if it can prevent more innocents to be killed later on? Despite some extreme views, the viewer rarely if ever feels judgment toward any of the characters. Their humanness is real.

As decisions must be made quickly due to time constraints, ""Eye in the Sky"" is a thriller. It could also be considered a suspense where one of the mysteries is who is right and who is wrong. Guy Hibbert's screenplay is very rich in its moral questions, making this film's story superior to the many other military films of recent years. It includes a relevant topic and very powerful dialogue. Even the details of fundamentalist bullies in Nairobi are subtle with their impact. It is also notable for showing a believable (and non-propagandistic) human side to those in the military who must make extremely difficult decisions.

Director Gavin Hood keeps the tension alive with astute skill. The detailed use of advanced spying technology is also thrilling. In addition to Mirren and Dolan, the rest of the cast contribute greatly to this fine production especially the late, great Alan Rickman. In the final scene, he delivers a line that is the perfect conclusion for a great film.

Permalink",False,"The Trolley Problem is a sociological experiment where an individual is asked how they would respond to an unfolding tragedy. In this, the individual is positioned in a place where they can see a tram or trolley travelling towards a person working on the line. The person will be killed, unless you pull a lever which will send the trolley onto another track. Simple choice, yeah? Now imagine that there are people on both tracks, and either your action or inaction will result in deaths. Action may result in fewer deaths than inaction, but ultimately it comes down to how you think you will deal with the guilt of being directly responsible for x deaths versus being indirectly responsible for y deaths.

Eye in the sky cleverly uses this idea in a way which is much more plausible: A drone strike on a terrorist cell hiding in a densely populated area. Helen Mirren is in charge of an international anti-terrorism operation in possession of intelligence indicating the location of some high level targets. Drone pilots Aaron Paul and Phoebe Fox are to fire the missile which will neutralise these targets. As the senior pilot, Paul is the one who must pull the trigger; however the potential for collateral damage is too high for his liking. At the same time, politicians overseeing the operation lack the will to give an order they feel will come back on them if it is unsuccessful. What follows is a first ever look into how the drone strikes we read about in the news every other day may weigh on the consciences of those who pilot them, and the political fallout from their actions. While the tension mounts, and the probability of success versus failure is calculated, Mirren struggles to straddle the two worlds in which she must convince the military brass and politicians that the action is necessary; and at the same time convince the team she has authority over that it is vital. The end result is a film where nobody escapes the emotional engagement of such an event and all must resolve their actions in their own ways.

This was Alan Rickman's last onscreen performance as Mirren's boss, acting as the conduit between the operations centre and the politicians as they sit at antique furnishings drinking tea and try to avoid making any decision which they may be held accountable for. Paul condenses the emotional range he showed in Breaking Bad to provide a compelling illustration of the conflict in the mind of the man with his finger on the trigger. Mirren's dogged determination and self assuredness is the balance between the two conflicts, trying not to let either one derail the operation. And all the while, the people walking the streets of Nairobi unaware that their fates are being decided by people in far off lands.

Eye in the Sky is both original and captivating. This is a fantastic way to bring modern warfare, fought not on battlefields but from offices in various parts of the world connected by communications technologies, to the big screen with tension and emotion."

Permalink",False,"Full credit to the film for tackling some of the moral dilemmas of modern warfare - unfortunately the good news ends there. Poor direction leads to a film lacking in tension, with contrived scenes involving many stereotypical protagonists; so lacking in tension is this film that I went to do the washing up, that being a more gripping activity. The bad news does not stop there. The casting is awful, Alan Rickman is a fine actor but falls completely flat as General Benson. Surprisingly given some of her previous roles Helen MIrren fails to inhabit the role of Colonel Powell - a more unlikely pair of high ranking military officers there has never been. If Britain's defence relies on these two officers then we are in big trouble. The politicians are laughable in their inability and the American soldiers mere facsimiles. Watch, but have low expectations.

Permalink",False,"You know that philosophical question - What if you could save five people in the path of a runaway train by switching the points, but this would lead to one person being killed? This film dramatizes that problem brilliantly.

Terrorists are preparing to strike, and we're all ready to drop a bomb on them when a sweet little girl from Central Casting wanders into the line of fire. Cue bickering, buck passing and nail biting suspense as the protagonists try to work out what to do. And this film is brilliant at asking: What would you do? Would you drop the bomb, trade one life for eighty and accept responsibility for killing an innocent? Would you wait, let the terrorists strike and cynically win the propaganda war?

The most terrifying thing about this film are the implied questions. This is just a film, it says - the protagonists are idealized Hollywood characters who genuinely want to save lives. How much worse is it in the real world, where people aren't nearly as nice? How many times has this happened this month, this week, today? And - how long before the enemy gets hold of this sort of technology?

A thought provoking, disturbing film that left me with the sense that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better."

Permalink",True,"I thought I would write a post-Manchester review. In May 2017 a bomb went off killing 23 people of whom ten were under the age of 20.

This film is about whether it is better to spare one child and allow a suicide bomber to go ahead or sacrifice the child and kill everyone in the bomb factory

I didn't feel there was a moral dilemma. The film is only two years old before the writing of this review. I live in Manchester and having seen the aftermath of a bomb aimed at children, the idea of sacrificing one to save more seemed a straightforward trade-off, with no element of "" shall I - shan't I ?""

The moral dilemma such as it was - was not discussed as such but much more shuttled around. The team couldn't decide or more likely was told by people they could not decide - so it was referred up. Past the attorney-general to the minister and possibly prime minister . Then across to more ministers of another country . The only issue was that politicians are not good moral debaters.

I waited for the real moral dilemma

A few months earlier, at London Bridge men carrying knives were shot out of hand by the then armed police without warning. We live in interesting times

Permalink",False,"Intense, riveting, enjoyable to watch. It's somewhat reassuring that, if true, those in-charge do actually care about collateral damage. I'm also glad to see that the drone pilots aren't 'cowboys'. They're real people, doing a job I can't possibly imagine having the strength or stomach to do. As demonstrated by the drone pilots here (Aaron Paul, Phoebe Fox), it's not just a job of 'kill or be killed'. There is a human, with human emotions behind that thing in the sky that can unleash Hellfire at the press of a button 10,000 miles away. That's a point this movie makes: there is a human side to every action taken.

Speaking of unleashing Hellfire in the most humane way possible, Helen Mirren (I still love you), Ma'am, what Can I say? She can play the Queen or a sparkplug Colonel with grace and dignity and a military backing her.

Permalink",True,"This is one of several films that have come out about the use of drone missiles and the collateral damage that they cause. This one is by far superior to the lot due to the strong cast. In this production, the setting is Somalia. Their ability to arrest was lost and now they are desperate to take out high level targets that include both US and British citizens. As a recruit puts on a vest, a little collateral damage girl, who thinks math is hard, is just outside.

The film deals less with the moral issue than previous films. It is deemed okay to take life. The question now becomes should the military be ""handcuffed"" by politicians. The film shows the difficulties involved and answers the question for whatever side you are on.

The next time you hear a short, one line item in the news about a militant being killed by a drone strike - think to the moral and ethical dilemmas portrayed in this movie. Juicy target with a risk of ""collateral damage"". What would you do? The British politicians come across as wavering sissies. The Americans as hard bitten and decisive and who would like to get back to their game of ping pong. Both points of view have some validity.

While I am sure some of the technology portrayed had to be ""assumed"" as it is still secret - the plot stands up just fine.

Worth a watch and more involved than the trailer.

Permalink",True,"The age old conundrum; Do the ends justify the means? Eye In the Sky starts off very leisurely in trying to tackle this dilemma. As the movie progresses, its pace doesn't bomb down at super speeds at all either, it remains pretty sedate throughout, however, the tension Gavin Hood was building was quite solid.

The entire movie is literally centered around one question, one situation. Is the life of one little girl, worth the possible death of tens of other civilians? Though there is a type of thinness to the plot, its importance however lends some credibility, and does very well in involving the viewer in said debacle.

Bureaucracy. Cowardice. Selfishness. Hypocrisy. These are pertinent elements this movie explores at different depths, however, depicts quite boldly. Personally, the character that I found the most annoying - for a lack of a better term, though an effort to redeem him was attempted; LT General Frank Benson. His hypocrisy and selfishness is pretty damning.

Academy Award Winner Helen Mirren's performance was meh, to OK. Probably not her fault though. Everybody else was as good as expected, however, a performance that definitely caught my eye, came from Babou Ceesay, the Risk Assessment Officer. His performance was so natural, and though he may be an ""unknown"", I believe he took this role, and made it the best it could be.

Eye In the Sky is a very decent movie. Even with the slow-moving pace, the tension build up was well done. At points it also felt somewhat empty, and that can potentially lose the viewers interest. I only wish we could've been given some level of closure, to the possible consequences that followed Colonel Powell and LT General Benson's decision.

7/10.

Permalink",True,"We do need films that present the dilemmas of high-tech warfare, and in particular the use of drones; and the Gavin Hood-Guy Hibbert offering that is ""Eye in the Sky"" is a spectacularly good piece of work that managed to open my eyes further, relatively well-versed in the realities of modern warfare as I nevertheless consider myself to be.

As a traditional kind of a guy, I find it uncomfortable to hear of further cuts in the size of Britain's armed forces, and perplexed to see that this happens as my country's spending on defence keeps on rising. This film goes some way to allaying my fears, and accounting for what is happening. Just how many personnel do we need, if our forces are really as (amazingly) globally integrated as this film seems to suggest? And just how many when we have drones and other high-tech and can see what the enemy is doing down to the finest possible detail?

Equally, fears about the cynicism of the military-industrial complex are also surprisingly well laid to rest here. A film that drafts in such classy actors renowned for high-integrity roles as Iain Glen, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam and the late and much-lamented Alan Rickman does so with every awareness that the audience will see the characters they play as worthy of respect. And that is so in this movie, where nobody is especially gung-ho, and everybody is at least somewhat swayed by even the loss of a single innocent life. The fact that no such tenderness, forethought or kindness is displayed by the suicide-bomber enemy armed to the teeth despite being headquartered in the midst of an otherwise poverty-stricken residential district of Nairobi is by no means a message that this film rams down its audience's throat, but this is not in fact the scandalous neglect it would seem to be. Far better that we arrive at this conclusion more gently and gradually by ourselves, through our own effort. For then that conclusion is all the stronger, and the condemnation all the greater...

The bald truth here is that no politician, civil servant, soldier, airman or agent featured here is evil. None are trigger-happy. All bear the responsibility. All do the soul-searching. Certainly the military types strain at the leash more, are more willing than the civilians to contemplate some ""collateral damage"". Of course they are, that is why they wear the uniforms and not the rest of us! That is what we pay and train them to do! But now, more than ever before, there is reality to civilian control over the military, as the ministry people and politicians get to see strike operations carried out before their very eyes, get to make the calls. And they are not trained to take the incredibly tough decisions that those in uniform are. Hence the huge tension this film features, and the endless (and entirely understandable) desire to pass the buck up the chain of civilian command.

Of course the film adds to all that the new, and weird, and psychologically daunting, job that is Reaper drone pilot. In this sphere life has already preceded art, but the art here is still well worth having. At the end of the film, the featured American airbase location offers a neat contrast between the row of anonymous-looking ground-based huts where the drone pilots sit and an aircraft of the old-fashioned type roaring into takeoff in the background, presumably with pilot in cockpit. Feet firmly on the ground, drone pilots take their decisions in colder blood, with better visuals and with none of the adrenaline and slight immunity to discomfort that the fear present in battle can offer. These ""pilots"" are told ""to go home"" at the end of the day, but to make sure they are back at their posts within 12 hours! No end-of-the-day banter and mutual backslapping or commiseration among like-minded folk for these guys, just an immediate need to readjust to life at home, far from the realities of the frontline, yet expected to be fully linked up with that reality in virtual terms.

""Eye in the Sky"" also reminds us that we still experience a degree of helplessness without ""boots on the ground"", and in this sense the soldier heading the Kenyan forces standing ready looks convincing, as does the even-more-in-the-line-of-fire Jama Farah - a fine and hugely sympathetic role for ""Captain Phillips"" actor Barkhad Abdi.

All of this needs to be thought on, and it certainly is in - and thanks to - this fine, very well-acted, intriguing and plausible-looking film, which has a very great deal going for it and can be much recommended.

Permalink",False,"After watching the film good kill a few years ago I thought that drone strike films didn't have anything interesting to show but I actually ended up quite liking eye in the sky. The premise of this film sees a military commander try to get approval to launch a drone strike even though there is a potential high risk of casualty. Helen mirren plays the military commander in this film and she is really good in this film, she has allot of edge to her character and you have sympathy because she is really put in a no win situation. Her character can come across as a bit antagonistic in this film but I take it as a leader under the stress of this highly volatile situation. Aaron Paul plays the drone controller in this film and he possibly gives his best ever performance in this film, considering he is just sat looking at a screen for the majority of the film he really delivers a strong performance that makes you care about his character and situation. This is the last ever live action performance from the amazing Alan rickman as he plays the military director In this film an like usual he is great in this film. He adds allot to his character in this film and his delivery of his lines sometimes sends chills down your spine. Barkhad Abdi from captain Phillips and Ian glen from game of thrones are both in this film in slightly smaller roles but they are both really good in this in their roles. The story has a really interesting take on digital warfare and you see the different points of views being displayed as you pretty much understand all of them. Unfortunately, this film has so much going on with different characters from all over the world that it can become a bit confusing and a bit too much to follow or care about. The script has some decent dramatic and humorous dialogue but none of it stands out as being very memorable and it doesn't help elevate any of the characters. The style of this film is a bit of an odd one, the last 20/30 minutes of this film is some of the most intense thrilling scenes I have seen in recent memory that had me biting my nails. But the first 30\45 minutes is some of the most boring cinema I have seen in recent memory an I swear I almost fell asleep. I ended up enjoying eye in the sky and think if you like some intense drone strike films then you should probably watch this film."

Permalink",True,"EYE IN THE SKY is an engaging morality play masquerading as a war thriller. The story is hot up to date and involves western participants battling Islamic extremism and also features surveillance and drone warfare. The film is much better than expected given the pedigree of the writer (who only worked in TV previously) and director (Gavin Hood, previously of ENDER'S GAME and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, two films hardly setting the world on fire).

The main problems with stories such as this is the political agenda behind them and EYE IN THE SKY is unsurprisingly heavy-handed in places. It's a liberal-left piece of propaganda decide to open the eyes of audience members, right wingers included, so some of the plot events play out largely as you'd expect with all of the requisite hand-wringing. There are certain endings that the writer would never dare to tackle so at times this feels like a typical BBC evening production despite attempts to keep you guessing.

Nonetheless the direction is surprising efficient and for a film which mainly consists of characters sitting around in rooms and watching screens, it's often gripping with edge-of-the-seat suspense. The cast is also up to the job with the main roles perfectly picked. Helen Mirren has been playing caricatures for over a decade now (and I include her role in THE QUEEN in that category) so it's nice to see her getting to grips with something meatier. Iain Glen is typically excellent and Aaron Paul shines too. I was really pleased to see Barkhad Abdi excelling again a role very different from his one in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS. Best of the bunch is the scene-stealing Alan Rickman in his final screen performance, a much-missed actor reminding us of his continuing excellence.

Permalink",True,"I started to watch this movie purely based on the title. As a fan of Alan Parsons Project, it was the title that triggered me. I didn't read the story-line at all.

Though the story seems to get going a bit slow and rough - were you just try to figure out who is who, where is where and what is happening when - it grabs your attention as soon as the plot becomes clear. And it never let's go. You feel like you get to know all the people, you get to understand them, you start to like them. You cry when they cry... and why.

This movie pulls you into the real, nasty and extreme decisions that sometimes have to be made. It show's how only a few people dare take that necessary but devilish decision to kill some, in order to save lots of people.

I'm not a big fan of the military. Never was, never will. I'll never understand the need for some to overpower others, especially if they don't mind taking lives for it. In a perfect world, there should be no need for any kind of armed group. Police nor defense.

But still... here we are. In an imperfect world, in which we, mankind, created the need for armies. And in this world there are man and woman that try to do whatever they can. Counting the costs, counting lives... balancing costs against lives...

Eye in the sky showed me that those are not easily made decisions. And even though it might seem that they cause unnecessary death, they also prevent a lot of losses.

I'm still not a fan of the military. But I sure do acknowledge the bravery of those who dare take that responsibility.

I think this movie is brilliant because it shows the right and the wrong, especially in the person of colonel Powell (Helen Mirren). Impressive - very impressive.

Permalink",True,"s this a satire or spoof suspense, or both? Those evil Brits cajoling and brow-beating poor sobbing, sentimental US officers into carrying out a drone strike which will prevent several suicide bombings but unfortunately also risk the life of one innocent girl. This matter is implausibly debated by the cast while bucks are being passed in every direction. We have all seen the dreadful videos of drone strikes where the concern about collateral damage is precisely zero. If Tom Lehrer was correct ""satire was no longer possible"", on hearing the news that Henry Kissinger had been awarded the Nobel Peace prize, then this probably finishes the job and pours gasoline on the corpse. A fairly compelling film overall but not one to be taken seriously. It is a pity that Alan Rickman's final performance should be in such a film as this.

Permalink",False,"I had a good reason for seeing ""Eye in the Sky"" and it certainly wasn't because it's a drone warfare movie. I mean, how exciting could that possibly be, especially with almost everyone tied down to a desk. That's where the real surprise comes in because this is riveting; a taut nail-biter that never fails to keep eyes on the screen. I greatly enjoyed this. As a Hollywood movie, I'd recommend this to anyone.

That's less so for its political commentary, which I think is actually pretty muddy. I'm not sure where I stand on that. I don't think drone engagements are so cut-and-dried, but it makes for hearty moralizing. But I also don't want to send the wrong message about the politics. This isn't ""They Live"" or ""Red Dawn"" and I think that one can still walk away from this movie with their views left unscathed. It's just that the presence of that one little girl feels contrived in a dramatic narrative sense.

Regardless of all of that, this is clearly made by the performances of its cat, which is uniformly solid. Which brings us to the reason this came over my radar in the first place. This is the final performance of Alan Rickman; and while he doesn't have the room-staling freedom of type-A Helen Mirren, he was my favorite aspect. Not just that voice, but the very gravity of his presence. This was a fine note to go out on. Godspeed, sir.

Permalink",False,"The review by malmukman totally nailed this movie and all the ""ethical questions"" around it. We're in a real war. No military personnel fights a war like the way it was portrayed in this movie. The military does not target the innocent and yes, there is collateral damage. But terrorists DO target the innocent.

This movie makes the military look ridiculous. They are trained to engage in war. They know that and while I'm sure it breaks hearts to see innocent people die, they know their actions will save more lives.

I'm not sure what the purpose of this movie was other than to spread propaganda.

If you want a suspense military action terrorist movie, watch Zero Dark 30. That's an honest to God realistic way we have to fight the war on terrorism.

Permalink",False,"Often films like this try to do too much. They dart from country to country, character to character and story to story. It's almost impossible to keep up with all the plot lines and character motivations and story arcs. At the beginning of 'Eye in the Sky' I thought it was going to fall into that same trap. But instead it was simply setting up elements for one story. And it resulted in a very fine film.

There's an ensemble cast at play here and they all perform exceptionally well. Helen Mirren is the lead role, if you had to pick one. I read that her character was originally intended for a man. I can understand why, as I watched I kept thinking this was a very tough and cold-hearted woman we were witnessing here. She pulled it off perfectly though. The real star of the show though, in his last ever live-action role, was Alan Rickman. The man could act. His line delivery truly sets him apart. An amazing talent that will be sadly missed.

What makes this a great movie is that it's immensely simple, and yet intricately complicated all at once. The audience is always kept in the loop. Every decision a character has to make, is also a decision the audience is silently having to make in their own head at the same time. It's a hard-hitting film that makes no apologies for what it is. I absolutely loved this film and am very glad I got the chance to see it. One not to be missed."

Permalink",False,"The film peers through the eyes of a military drone and mulls about 'Collateral Damage Estimates' (CDE). The film-makers have done a good job in showing the nature of drone strikes from the viewpoints of most involved parties--the collaterals, the generals, the drone pilots, the CDE soldiers, the politicians and the soldiers on the ground. Such an intense buildup from all parties needs a compelling climax, and the movie does not disappoint. The subplots involving the Kenyan population--children mainly--are realistic, well acted and blend subtly into the urgency of the mission. You root for the girl with the Hula hoop. Alan Rickman's last role as a general is done with the usual perfect dialogue delivery and poise.

Overall, a watchable film about the heart of the contemporary topic of drone strikes.

Permalink",False,"This film explores the morality of drone warfare and basically lets you, the audience, decide. I doubt if I'll see a more gripping and thought provoking film this year. The director has managed to create an film that has many edge of the seat /fingernail biting moments about people located in different rooms around the world talking to each other on telephones and looking at computer screens. The bad guys are the bad guys, no question but everything else is shades of grey. Helen Mirren disproves any notion that women are the weaker sex. Alan Rickman, in his last role, brilliantly shows his talent with a collection of dry one liners that add a satirical layer to the film. He also gets the chance to deliver possibly the best put-down speech to politician. Basically, you've got the Brit, American and Kenyan military plus the terrorists. Then you've got the local Kenyan people just trying to survive. You could argue that the American politicians are shown as being gung-ho whilst their Brit counterparts come across as not having a pair of balls/ backbone between them but both the Brit and American military are shown as real three dimensional people, especially the drone pilots. One of whom has only just qualified. They are all aware of the consequences of their actions. For the drone pilots this isn't simply a more elaborate video game and, although physically remote, through technology they are arguably closer to the the target than many other soldiers in a war zone. Go watch it and make up your own mind about the rights and wrongs of drone warfare."

Permalink",True,"That is all I kept screaming. I'm too old to be in the service now but I should have enlisted in the drone service. All the hand wringing was too much for me. Should have fired and asked/answered questions later!!!!! There was no doubt that war is full of hard decisions but still. To risk 80-100 lives in order to save one to me is not even debatable. The actors all did fine jobs portraying the points of view being considered and finally they made the right decision. I was really surprised/impressed to see Helen Mirren playing a role not related to a monarch or other somewhat drippy roles she has done in her past. Really was a good acting job......

Permalink",True,"Tense and exciting, this movie follows a British mission keeping an eye on some wanted terrorists including a radicalized white British woman. The mission is led by the excellent as always Helen Mirren. It's quite fascinating how they use a variety of surveillance devices birds insects in addition to drones. The multinational team is interesting to watch too with Aaron Paul playing a drone pilot in Nevada. The mission progresses from a capture to a kill because of a the terrorists about to launch a suicide bombing.

The ministers and non-military people are portrayed as frustratingly unable to make a decision as they try to pass the buck from one person to another.

One fault: it seems unlikely there would be such a big fuss over one girl as collateral damage against the risk of many more killed in a massive suicide bombing. In that sense the Ethan Hawke movie ""the Good Kill"" is more realistic - where they went ahead with many strikes despite the presence of collateral damage. Watch that movie for a more complete and less thriller like view of drones.

Well done and worth a watch.

That is the pathetic message. Alas, the allies would not have won the war against the Germans or the Japanese given such a ridiculous precept. And the teary USAF UAV flight controller gals was another demeaning element of this flick. Obviously innocent life matters, but the greater purpose of protecting civilization from evil intending domination trumps the bleeding heart point of view. Do not wast your time with this!

Permalink",True,"When I first started watching this, I was engaged. I like Helen Mirren, which is what brought me to this movie to begin with.

It wasn't long before I was saying ""What on earth?""

Eventually I began to think this was just very dark British humor. It was a muddled mess of how bureaucracy can get in the way of rational thinking. Red tape and politics and cowardice. It reminded me of ""The Thick of It"".

American soldiers shown as weak, crying babies who will not obey, or find ways around obeying commands. (yes, the ""pilot"" does, in real life, have final say and was using protocol to delay the attack)

Women in particular, shown as weak, crying emotional and irrational wrecks (sans Mirren, who goes off the ethical rail instead).

This movie shouted ""This is why women should not be in the military!"" and ""Women should not be in positions of power and decision making!""

Wow, what a bad movie. Or, should I say, breaking bad meets harry potter. I could hear the Snape sarcasm...

Too bad. Could have been a good one.

It tells a compelling story and succeeds in building dramatic tension without becoming contrived. The conflict is presented plainly. Every character plays an important role. Yet, Rickman drives this movie. His performance as the general in charge of the operation should earn him at least consideration for the highest official accolades. One can argue that the story is contrived; that in real life the issues presented in the movie would not come up; that the movie, in effect, resorts to cheap theatrics to build tension. That would be incorrect. Decisions like the one dramatized in this movie are made all the time. Priorities have to be weighed; what is expedient is weighed against what is right, producing results that call to question our commitment to the law.

Permalink",False,"""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war."" Lt. General Frank Benson (Alan Rickman)

Eye in the Sky is about the cost, mostly the collateral damage, of drone strikes. And the eyes on earth are either misty or crying because a little girl is potentially going to be part of the damage to a Somalian compound in Kenya. Like Andrew Niccol's Good Kill starring Ethan Hawke, this thriller emphasizes the damage to the soldiers who push the buttons.

Col. Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) is in charge of capturing an enemy, an objective that turns into ""prosecuting the target"" (yes, jargon has to play a part in a story about essentially a military operation). Benson (Alan Rickman's last performance, showing why the gifted actor will be missed) in Whitehall with the U.K. prime minister's reps and other contributing command centers such as Hawaii for image analysis and Las Vegas for drone pilots give the drama and guilt a global feel while emphasizing the distance from the target and the menace of the quiet eye in the sky.

Although the pic tends to the maudlin and unrealistic with some officers and experienced warriors literally crying over the little girl, basic anguish about the moral and legal components of war seems all too real. While Col. Powell pushes to have the chance of collateral damage be 45% rather than its probable 65% (""In war, truth is the first casualty,"" Aeschylus, the film's epigraph), she can only hope the little girl escapes the blast and civilian oversight accepts her decision.

I once thought the real sufferers were the grunts fighting mano a mano; I now see because of the realistic depiction of drone warfare in films like Eye in the Sky, the sufferers are also those who, thousands of miles away, pinpoint targets and pull triggers. Thank goodness filmmakers expose us to the kind of wars we now wage—when asked at the ballot booth to support or deny war on a global stage, we can make informed decisions.

In addition, we can enjoy the thrilling chess game between bad guys and good guys back home and wherever"

Permalink",True,"I thoroughly disagree with the other reviewers declaring this film a propaganda piece. If anything, it refuses to take sides of an impossible decision; do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, especially when the likely collateral damage is very very clear well in advance of a strike.

I found myself relieved that I didn't have to make the final call.

Unspooling the action part of the film in real time worked beautifully. One of those films that leaves you literally breathless when the end credits roll, in part because you have been holding your breath with no idea how anything will resolve.

Also perfectly cast - brilliant touch to have the primary military person be portrayed by a woman. Alan Rickman is brilliant and makes you sorry again that he's gone so soon. Also glad to see Aaron Paul on screen in a vehicle where you can appreciate what a great, understated performance can do to ratchet up dread.

well worth seeing - and will definitely have you questioning your own values and appreciating the awful choices the military must make on a daily basis.

Permalink",True,"The plot is Shakespearian in the multiple messages and tragedies. Largely portrayed via electronic video viewpoints from drones (large and minuscule). Those who control the drones, those who control the controllers and those above them !

Is it justified to murder (or injure) one or more innocents to assassinate known terrorists preparing bomb vests ?

i.e. Kill a small innocent child selling bread (collateral damage) is justified in order to kill two suicide bombers. Failure to do so means the bombers will almost certainly kill, maim and injure many other innocents.

I liked the way the whole scenario was portrayed for different groups involved in the tragedy and different dilemmas.

The professional military (led by Helen Mirren) tasked with a job to capture terrorists, where one or more, are British Citizens.

However when the terrorists are located, in a house in a 'rebel' controlled area. (i.e. It is not possible for a ground force to go in). They discover two suicide bombers are being armed with bomb vests in the same building. If the suicide bombers leave the house and separate, it will impossible to stop at least one of them.

Targets identified were pre authorised for assassination if found (despite including British and U.S. passport holders)

For the military it's a relatively straightforward decision: 'Eliminate' 2+ known terrorists pre approved for assassination + 2 suicide bombers preparing to leave and attack. Cost: one childs life (sacrifice one innocent to save 80+ others)

How the politicians will dither rather than make a decision, then pass the buck up rather than take a decision. Yet with total hypocrisy when the next 'higher'politician up delays, throw up their hands in outrage at the delay (knowing they no longer have responsibility for the decision)

How others will talk and delay rather than act. I.e. morale 'do- gooders' who think there is always a talk it out option.

Tension mounts will the girl leave her bread stall. Can they lure her away. will the missile attack be authorised anyway ?

Do you unleash the dogs of war knowing you murder innocents. Does the 'end' justify the means?

How much restriction should or should not be put in the way of the military anyway in this kind of 'dirty' war

When do the 'good guys' actions start to make them 'bad guys' too?

This film kept me rapt in attention and so many questions and 'shades of grey' dilemmas.

Good film recommended ! 7.5/10

Permalink",True,"I saw ""Eye in the Sky"", starring Helen Mirren-The Red movies, National Treasure:Book of Secrets; Aaron Paul-Need For Speed, The Last House on the Left_2009 and Alan Rickman-The Harry Potter movies, Dogma. FYI:This is also Alan's final live action role before he passed away.

This is a movie that poses questions. It is not action packed but it is suspenseful. Helen plays a British Colonel in charge of a top secret mission to capture or kill terrorists. She is coordinating with America, using their drones, which is also where the title 'Eye in the Sky' comes from-referring to the drones and satellites used for surveillance. Alan is the British General in charge above Helen. Aaron is the pilot of the drone and he is in America. When Helen gets Intel on a big meeting in Kenya of 3 or 4 terrorist-from their top ten list- all the intelligence people start talking back and forth, trying to get conformation on the drone attack. There are lots of factors to consider; moral, political and personal implications that have to be factored in. For instance, should the attack take place with civilians walking around that might become casualties? Then, Helen discovers the terrorist have explosives and are arming for some suicide bombings, so again, is the cost of a few civilian lives worth however many people might be hurt somewhere else, like maybe a shopping mall or a stadium? And Remember, the Colonel is in England, the pilot of the drone is in America and the targets/terrorists are in Kenya, South Africa! It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was enough-but it would be a good rental.

Permalink",False,"Things started out somewhat unrealistic in typical Hollywood fashion. Cool weapons and super drones that are helped by CGI because we all know they don't exist yet. But let's just go with the fantasy. Proceed to tracking a terrorist with a drone and then comes the question of what to do when a terrorist that is going to wipe out dozens of people is in the vicinity of a adorable Muslim girl. Basically the world stops completely for the possibility that adorable Muslim girl may be collateral damage.

Proceed to endless talking about legalities, as if these things happen during a mission, not before. The talking is interminable. Some important things that happen are ignored when the story doesn't want you to think about them, like the innocent man on the ground whom I won't discuss. He just disappears for a good part of the film even though he's the most likable character of all.

This could have easily been a stage play that requires 4 sets and rotates between them. The compound, the air crew, the war room and the local intelligence room. That's it. And for an hour it's just about endless bickering while the imminent danger just stays on pause because... well.... the story couldn't be dragged out into showing how endless bureaucracy is. Preposterous. Unrealistic. Silly. Stupid. What a waste of Helen Mirren and the young talent of the man on the ground. A very sad last film for the great Alan Rickman, also great underused.

Permalink",False,"I've felt sorry for the actors in this movie. They made it worth watching in spite of the poor plot. I saw the review that said '... the film's morality is more dubious than it recognizes' and quickly related to the comment. The story went out of its way to force making a point about the morality involved in the drone strike. In doing so, it portrayed the military and government as rookies who'd never been through this before and needed to explain to each other in detail all the implications; the collateral damage of the young girl and the propaganda war. The same could have been accomplished had the plot been written differently, with the government and military both keeping their credibility. The film conveyed a message, however without much realism in it. To have to see the British state official on the toilet with food poisoning, and the teary-eyed soldiers in front of their computer monitors while performing a task they are supposedly trained to do and deal with emotionally was asking a bit too much. The film seems to want the viewer to act like they know nothing about military execution and discipline and government policies to do with clandestine air strikes. Once the film thinks it's absolved of this responsibility, it embarrassingly spoon feeds the viewer a serving of morality learned in a junior high school social justice class.

I might believe it happened once that way but there's no excuse for presenting it here as if it were the norm or even an idealization of what happens. Rather, most Americans at least would be shocked at how many innocents die everyday due to our military. And though this movie is mostly situated in the UK, it's altruistic parts are clearly meant to rub off on us.

Permalink",False,"Eye in the Sky joints itself to the list of movies or TV series questioning and analyzing the use of drones to conduct long-distance attacks with sad consequences justified for the sake of the war on terror. The film Good Kill placed us on the chair of the drones pilots, comfortably set in Las Vegas while they destroy populations in the other side of the world; the TV series Homeland employs the same concept at least once a year; and the eighth season of 24 reversed the roles, with terrorists capturing British drones in order to attack London. In summary: it's a provocative subject which is fertile for ethical discussions and ideological conflicts. And Eye in the Sky takes total advantage of that circumstance, with a premise which allows us to examine each step of the process, while we rethink our opinion with every new data and revelation. This means that Eye in the Sky isn't an action film at all. I would consider it a political-military thriller, in which many scenes are set into boardrooms, operation centres and the previously mentioned metallic containers in Las Vegas in which the unmanned vehicles are controlled. And, sure, we also occasionally visit the city of Nairobi, in Kenya (even though the film was shot in South Africa), in order to witness the preparations for a terrorist attack, proving that cold strategic decisions always contemplate the reality of lives in danger, whether acting or ignoring the problem. The only complaint I have against this movie is the fact that screenwriter Guy Hibbert occasionally employs some slight manipulations. For the rest, Eye in the Sky is a fascinating look ""behind the curtain"", illustrating the incomprehensible scale of the decisions which must be made in situations in which it's not possible to win... just losing less than the enemy. And, sure, the perfect performances from Helen Mirren, Aaron Paul and the sadly deceased Alan Rickman highlight the human part of the military apparatus, which is as essential as the tremendous technology employed in infiltration and espionage. So, in conclusion, Eye in the Sky is an excellent film which inspires reflections about subjects which, fortunately, we rarely find outside a video game. The pressed buttons are similar, but the consequences can't be more different."

Basically high- level Al-Shabaab extremists are meeting in a safe house in Nairobi, Kenya, Colonel Katherine Powell (Dame Helen Mirren) is commanding a mission to capture them. Air surveillance is provided by a General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper drone controlled from Creech Air Force Base in Nevada by USAF pilot Steve Watts (Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul), and ground intel comes from undercover Kenyan field agents, including Jama Farah (Captain Phillips' Barkhad Abdi), using short-range video bugs. Kenyan ground troops are positioned nearby to execute an arrest, but Farah discovers the terrorists have explosives, two suicide bombers are preparing for what is presumed to be a civilian target, Powell decides that the mission objective has changed from ""capture"" to ""kill"". Powell informs drone pilot Watts to prepare for a precision missile attack on the building, but legal counsel is required to do so, to her frustration Powell's counsel advises her to seek approval from her superiors. Lieutenant General Frank Benson (Alan Rickman) in London is supervising the mission, with members of the UK government as witnesses, he asks for their authorisation, citing conflicting legal and political views, including possible negative publicity for killing civilians, they fail to reach a decision and refer to the Foreign Secretary James Willett (Game of Thrones' Iain Glen). Due to a bout of food poisoning whilst on a trade mission to Singapore, the Foreign Secretary does not give a definite answer, he attempts to defer to the US Secretary of State, who is on a cultural exchange in Beijing, he authorises the strike, but insist due diligence to minimise ""collateral damage"". The situation at the safe house becomes more difficult to assess, when pre-teen girl Alia Mo'Allim (introducing Aisha Takow), who lives in the house adjacent, sets up a table to sell loaves of bread, she is visibly in grave danger if the building and the explosives are struck by a missile. Watts and his USAF colleague Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox) see Alia is just outside the building, they seek to delay firing until she moves, Farah attempts to buy all of her bread so she will leave, but his cover is blown and he forced to flee, and the level of urgency is raised when the suicide bombers are finishing their preparations and the surveillance video of them is lost. Powell seeks authorisation to launch a strike, so she orders a risk-assessment officer to find strike parameters that will allow him to quote a lower risk of civilian casualties, he re- evaluates a strike point and places the probability of Alia's death at 45 to 65 percent, she coerces him to report only the lower figure up the chain of command. The strike is subsequently authorised, Watts reluctantly fires the missile, just as Farah pays a boy to buy the remaining bread loaves from Alia, she has moved far enough to survive the strike, the missile hits and the building is levelled, casualties lie in and around the building, including an injured and unconscious Alia. Targetted extremists are identified, but one of the terrorist leaders has survived and Watts is required to fire a second missile, it strikes just as Alia's parents find her, they suffer minor injuries and rush Alia to hospital, the medical personnel are unable to revive her and she is pronounced dead, Powell and the other military staff are shaken by the events of the completed mission. Also starring Jeremy Northam as Brian Woodale, Armaan Haggio as Musa Mo'Allim, Richard McCabe as George Matherson, Carl Beukes as Sergeant Mike Gleeson, Kim Engelbrecht as Lucy Galvez and Gavin Hood as Lieutenant Colonel Ed Walsh. Mirren is great as the steely colonel, Paul does well as the concerned pilot, and Rickman gives a great final on screen performance as the (in moments humorously) exasperated intermediary. Mirren quoted that this film, that takes place in real time, is exactly how a real-life drone mission would go in real life, where the military must refer to the higher in command, and even the prime minister, before making strikes, even when a situation threatens hundreds, if not thousands, of lives, it really engages you with the one mission, you are on the edge of your seat and digging your fingers as the suspense increases, a most effective and gripping thriller film. Very good!

Permalink",True,"This comes over as something of a propaganda movie for the War on Terror. Using drones (including one designed to look like a housefly), a joint British-US-African intelligence team has tracked three Most Wanted Al-Shabab terrorists to a village house in Kenya where they are fitting up two freshman suicide bombers. Far from the killing zone, the drone 'mother-ship' is waiting to release its deadly missiles. But there's a girl selling loaves in the road outside the target house. 'Collateral damage' suddenly has a face, an identity.

Helen Mirren is in Jane Tennison mode as the UK mission controller. She and her boss (Alan Rickman in his final role) are pretty sanguine about the moral balance between one young bread vendor and the many lives that will be saved if the suicide bombers and their recruiters are taken out. But Whitehall mandarins (up to an including the Foreign Secretary) are a lot more squeamish than their opposite numbers in Washington. Surprisingly, the two people who will actually launch the missile (sitting at consoles in a Portakabin-like shed in faraway Hawaii) are allowed a voice in the debate. Is this credible? Surely they simply push the buttons they're ordered to push?

It's presumably meant to reassure us - as voters as well as moviegoers - that decisions about the lives of innocent civilians are weighed in the balance by military decision-takers. Given the recent history of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, this is a tough pill to swallow. But, credibility aside, EYE IN THE SKY is a tense nail-biting 'parable' about one short sharp episode in the endless battle between the Forces of Evil and those we like to hope (or wish) are the Forces of Good.

Permalink",False,"Having located a terrorist sleeper cell in Kenya, UK military forces have to contend with bureaucratic red tape, collateral damage reports and a possible child victim while authorising a strike to prevent a suicide bombing in this intense war thriller starring Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman. While the film boils down to a simple ethical dilemma of whether they can risk killing a little girl to save an estimated eighty lives (if the suicide bombing goes ahead), there is more to the film than just that. As arguments and counter-arguments are thrown back and forth between political leaders, military leaders and political/military advisors, the film highlights how important political implications are in decision-making, with Monica Dolan's adviser character saying that they (the US and the UK) would ""win the propaganda war"" if the terrorists killed eighty civilians rather than them killing one girl. The characters also take part in a lot of ""referring up"", with nobody wanting to take responsibility for the ramifications of their actions (or inaction). The tension in the air is hard to shake as things become increasingly time critical, and while events sometimes feel prolonged in 'everything that can go wrong, will go wrong' manner, it is a breathtaking and thought-provoking ride. The film is not, however, quite as neutral as it perhaps ought to be. Dolan comes across as obnoxious and ignorant for the most part and the two drone pilots are conveniently inexperienced, which makes it hard to buy the case for saving the girl considering that those three are the ones arguing for it. This slant towards taking action no matter what is interesting though as it serves to highlight how much can and does get in the way of military action in the YouTube era when public perceptions shape everything."

Permalink",True,"A good movie, with an excellent cast.

They do a superb job of boxing you into making a choice as to whether or not the life of an unknown innocent child is worth sacrificing in order to take out 2 soon to be suicide bombers who will most likely kill a far greater number of innocents.

It was nice to see the bad-guy leader from Captain Phillips play a hero role.

This is a major ""push your buttons"" kind of film. You are either mentally yelling ""launch the f'ng missile"" or ""don't you dare hurt her"".

Very frustrating, but a valid picture of opinions on drone strikes.

That said, 2 suicide bombers plus 3 high-value terrorists = I hope she lives through the blast.

Permalink",False,"This story based in Kenya , Drags in a poor little girl in to the storyline to give the movie a more socialist view. In many military movies what we see is mere destruction of livelihood due to political or terrorist reason. But what i see in here is a multitude of happenings which gives the real feel in a terrorist contained country. The way the director has come up with the initial introduction to the family was what inspired me. the restrictions on the kenyan's for a local girl not to learn neither to play.was greatly depicted in 2 or 3 situations. The family's income was depending on dad's cycle repairs and the bread which the child goes to sell everyday . So it shows in a real humorous way how war influences on people, families , different ethnics and mainly the young generation. Hats off for this. was a really nice movie, its a must watch.

Movies like these evoke thoughts on whether the modern warfare is indeed a solution or a bane to tackle such situations.

Permalink",True,"When I saw the trailer for Eye in the Sky, I was in immediately. The movie had a good cast, it seemed to present a genuinely tough dilemma as its premise and the morality of drone warfare is something that hasn't really been explored (I know there's already been a movie called Good Kill, I liked that movie but there's room for more than one). My brother saw it and said it was awesome so I was just that much more excited. I was finally able to see it and it was as great as I hoped it would be.

*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Eye in the Sky is an ensemble film but it starts out following a young girl in Kenya. She helps out her father, does her homework and then heads to the market to try and sell some bread.

We then join Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) as she gets ready for work. She seems normal enough, taking care of her dog and doing other chores. She then moves to her office and opens her e-mail. She sees the aftermath of an Al-Shabaab terrorist attack. Her job that day is to organize the capture of a high ranking Al-Shabaab terrorist leader named Susan Helen Danford (in co-operation with both the Kenyan government and the U.S. government).

We travel out to Las Vegas, Nevada where the operation for the unmanned drones is located at Creech Air Force Base. The U.S. armed forces will be providing the surveillance for the mission via their drones. At this location, we spend most of our time with the two drone pilots. Lieutentant Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) is the more experienced of the two pilots and is showing the other pilots the ropes. Neither of them are aware how important and how stressful their shift will be. The Kenyan military is also involved. Col. Powell is in contact with a ranking official in the Kenyan army who has a strike team assembled to capture Danford when given the okay. They also have a surveillance team, in a cube van close to the location led by Jama Farah (Barkhad Abdi). The surveillance team is being as careful as they can as there are several warring factions in the territory and if they are caught by the wrong one, they will be killed.

There's a lot to set up with this movie and although I want to talk about the plot more, I'd have to set up more locations and introduce more characters and I'll run out of words too quickly. I'll start with the cast, there's a lot of really talented actors playing parts in this movie and it shows in the end product. Helen Mirren plays probably the biggest part and she does an excellent job. Her character is firmly planted on one side of the issue but you can see the conflict within her as the situation becomes more and more complicated and it shows through her performance. Alan Rickman was great, this is his last movie and he did a superb job. His character is the one who's trying to get some sort of action going but the resolution to this situation is so tied up in red tape its ridiculous. It was good to see Aaron Paul in a more dramatic movie, he gets the chance to show what he can do and you see why he was so great on Breaking Bad. It was also good to see Barkhad Abdi again, he did a solid job on Captain Phillips and he does more solid work here.

Talking about the plot, it can be a little slow at the start. You can probably tell from my plot summary that there is a lot the movie needs to setup but I never found it painful to wait. You watch this operation unfold and it just gets more and more complicated and the morality of it gets more and more murky. It's fascinating to watch but it's not always fun. The movie makes you face some unpleasant truths and with it getting more and more tense, by the end of it you're holding your breath and yelling at the screen. It shows how good the movie is when you have that kind of emotional reaction to it. It's excellent work from the writing crew and director Gavin Hood who has had a mixed record so far.

The best thing that Eye in the Sky does is really present the issue of drone warfare in an objective light through this fictionalized story. You may go into this movie on one side but you might find yourself flip flopping on it as the movie goes along (I certainly did). By the end of it, the movie doesn't tell you how to feel one way or another. You can draw your own conclusions and when a movie can do that properly, it's pretty cool. If you want to question which way the movie is leaning, just look at the message board for Eye in the Sky, there's people starting arguments both ways, claiming the movie is propaganda for one side or the other. All things considered, minus being created to entertain as opposed to inform, I found it to be pretty down the middle and I would applaud the filmmakers for it.

I don't believe this movie is perfect but I think we could use more movies like it. There's a good debate here about morality and how modern warfare is beginning to work. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I hope more people get to see it. It's genuinely thought provoking, super intense and has some really good acting from a hell of a cast. If you're getting some summer blockbuster fatigue, pick this up on Blu-Ray.

Permalink",False,"What is the value of a single human life? That's the question rattling in the mind of American USAF drone pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul), who defies direct orders from British Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) and Lt. General Frank Benson (the late Alan Rickman) into blowing up a terror stronghold in the middle of a crowded Kenyan neighbourhood, as an innocent civilian walks right into the kill zone. They are racing against time; the terrorists are readying up for a much deadlier attack. The harrowing decision, and the dispute that surrounds it, is the heart of this exciting and frustratingly compelling thriller, down to its haunting closing scenes.

A dilemma like this, government politicians love to play the 'blame game'. Powell is ready to strike without compromise, but she and Benson can only wait for the greenlight by hesitant superiors. Guy Hibbert's script explores whether the politicians react as such to avoid the burden for approving such a strike, or to pat themselves on the back for averting loss of face. The subsequent moral, ethical and legal dilemmas slowly rile up all major characters like a boiling kettle.

Director Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Ender's Game) confidently crafts a gripping tale across continents where morality is given one hell of an endurance test, and invites the audience to debate with him. The work he has achieved with gifted thespians Mirren and Rickman (in one of his final roles) has resulted in a rock-solid morality play, and in a testament to his talent, Rickman's final scene powerfully sums up everything Hood and Hibbert have to say on the matter."

Permalink",False,"The only realistic part of this movie is a bunch of high ranking people avoiding to take responsibility for a strike against terrorists.

The rest is a ""moral"" dilemma about collateral damage in the shape of one single child. It boils down to the fact that Western governments would rather have suicide terrorists run loose and kill countless people than to risk one single life - that makes me feel so much safer... not.

Also lots of soldiers are more emotional than your average teenage girl and cry when they have to engage. I wonder why they joined the army in the first place.

Watched this on TV and I am still not sure what type of murky propaganda was selling, apart from the fact that there are masses of people employed in the wrong line of business.

Permalink",True,"Although not very realistic, the film asks very compelling moral questions. A British Colonel (Helen Mirren) is placed in charge of ordering two American pilots to strike a house in Kenya filled with known terrorists. The problem comes in the face of an innocent girl who is selling bread to feed her family, and that there is at least ""a sixty percent chance"" she will be killed if the house is struck by a missile. Because the terrorists have strapped themselves with bombs to commit an act of terrorism after leaving the house, a moral battle ensues. Some members of the British and American Governments and Militaries are supportive of striking the house, while others do not want to risk killing the little girl. Progressively, higher ups to the American Secretary of State and the Prime Minister are suggested to be consulted because no one knows what decision to make. The British Colonel decides to manipulate ""kill ratio"" by having the possibility of the girl being killed as low as ""45%"" in one spot of the house. The strike is finally made and the girl is killed. The British Colonel disobeys the wishes of the British Government to have a British woman who married one of the terrorists captured, and orders the British woman in the house to be killed by another missile. There were a number of flaws in the movie. Firstly, a pilot would not be able to refuse an order to launch the missile. Secondly, the British Colonel is portrayed so evilly that she starts to side track the message of the movie. Lastly, nothing is mentioned about the fact that the Kenyan Army is on stand by and could easily have seized the vehicle that the terrorists were in when they left the house. Still, I have to say it was a good movie that asked tough questions. There is no doubt that these extremists are very bad people and a danger to all around. Yet, launching a missile is not an exact science. It cannot be predicted exactly how much damage will be caused. More importantly, these terrorists are operating around a lot of innocent people. It is a tragedy seeing innocent people killed in war, and never easy. Lastly, pilots have to deal with the realities. The two pilots were from opposite ends of the country, and had never participated in a combat mission. At the end, they both have only twelve hours to report back to duty. We never find out what happens after that, but either the pilots will just serve out their duties or grow from their experience. These terrorists are really bad and dangerous people, but lots of innocent people die wars. Hopefully, this movie will make people think seriously about reality and that can only help themselves grow in understanding what war is. It is the individual's choice how to respond.

Maybe because this is not your typical action movie which glorifies the war. It's a great drama, with a bit of dark humor.

The only unfortunate thing is that in real-life, in 99% of operations the military doesn't really think too much. They just shoot and hope they've killed the targets, without even having a good Positive ID of the targets.

Most of soldiers don't have much empathy, so they don't care about collateral damage. And media is controlled from the top, so military isn't really concerned about media either. But here and there some people do have consciousness, and for them making a decision is hard.

This is not a Rambo / Commando / Platoon / Saving Private Ryan type of movie, but don't worry, there is enough of suspension. Highly recommended."

Permalink",True,"In a sense, Eye in the Sky is perfect for something, that is that if you're feeling tired, it's certain to put you to sleep.

I'm not saying it's a bad film, not by any stretch, but there was nothing in it that actually engaged me..., in other words it was fairly boring. So a task force assigned to capture terrorists in Kenya is headed up by Colonel Katherine Powell, played by the esteemed Helen Mirren, her current mission is to capture one of the countries most wanted terrorists, but matters take a turn for the worst when said terrorist and her cronies strap up for a suicide mission, soon capture turns to kill, but ethics come into play when a young girl strays into the blast zone.

Overly political, it demonstrates the very fact that red tape rules the world, or at least our side of the world..., how many different people and officials had to be contacted and persuaded just to get clearance to complete a mission? I'm surprised the terrorists didn't attack whilst Colonel Powell and the gang were messing about.

Also annoying is how the American pilot, Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) hesitates to take orders and follow his mission, really? Should a guy that emotional really be in charge of missiles?

Eye in the Sky could be interpreted in several different ways, and no way is a wrong way, just depends on opinions and emotions..., I found it ridiculously annoying, frustrating and an actual send up of the American armed forces, because simply the way they dealt with the situation is pathetic, it's war, you do what you've got to do, Al-Shabaab have to be stopped..., so stop hesitating and giving the enemy every advantage.

Slow, plodding and a waste of an hour and 40 minutes, overrated and just boring to be honest, there are other things you could watch, and other things you could do with your time.

It is totally unrealistic, and if the film is supposed to ease any kind of remorse, where's the point? There isn't any, simply because the plot is unreal.

(Spoiler>) In the film the drone controllers have a view over the action area that is better than what you get with a small drone flying 20 meters above ground. In reality the personnel behind the stick and monitors can't see if there's a little girl selling bread on the corner. And the beetle micro drone, how sweet. Neither do several ministers and a staff of personal advisers sit around and make the decision every time an enemy is to be eliminated by a rocket from a drone. In 2015 and 2016 there were 121.000 targets eliminated worldwide in the US drone program alone. Do anyone think that the foreign secretary, or any other minister or general for that matter, has to be asked for clarification every time?

I have a feeling that this is just stupid propaganda, and if so it's really annoying to see good actors wasting their time on it.

Permalink",False,"Eye in the Sky, while well acted and well made for a Holly Wood movie, is far too one-sided to be taken as anything resembling reality in recent years. Given the fact that most order-following cowards sitting behind their super gaming consoles will ""prosecute"" (quite the euphemism for what is full-on MURDER) anyone who they're told to ""take out"" by their commander/owners at the drop of a pay check makes this movie misleading and very close to propaganda and indoctrination. Still, it does portray the unethical, narcissistic, morally vacant ""top brass"" somewhat accurately which gives it some merit.

There are only two characters on the Western side in this movie who know the difference between what is morally Right and what is morally and ethically Wrong. While a third comes close, he/she doesn't have the conviction to say NO. You'll have to watch it for yourself and decide who I'm talking about. Calling someone a ""soldier"" who is not in actual combat (or the imminence of combat) where his/her life is being threatened by the enemy is language abuse and mind-control and the Alan Rickman character has no business make the claim he makes at the end.

But the movie does show that murdering innocent women and children at the behest of psychopathic ""commanders"" will take it's toll on their souls. At least it should. No wonder so many order followers have PTSD and/or commit suicide. IF THEY EVER learn the difference between Right and Wrong and FINALLY decide to say NO when told to do something they know, in good conscience, is Wrong, then they will have taken their first right step forward in their spirits' evolution toward the higher planes of existence. And the world will be that much better for their bravery. If not, well congratulations for making the world a safer place for billionaires and trillionaires. Nice job. Well done!

""41 men targeted but 1,147 people killed: US drone strikes"" ~The Guardian, 11/24/14 (which means those are very conservative numbers then and now). Ask any Pakistani wedding party what they think of drones. Unless they've all been blown to bloody shreds by someone sitting a thousand miles away and so therefore are unable to respond, they'll tell you that they're scared stupid and their government won't do anything about them because the CIA has their government in it's pockets. Yeah, pretty damn brave order-following there."

Permalink",False,"War as we know it has changed forever. Forget in your face battles or skilled pilots taking to the skies, now it's all about warfare from afar and most importantly to modern day capabilities, drone warfare in which someone sitting in the comfort of an office chair deep in the dusty plains of Nevada can lay waste to 100's on the other side of the world and all they need is a few gaming skills and hand eye coordination.

This aspect of modern warfare has been touched upon in such films as Andrew Niccol's Good Kill and now with Gavin Hood's Eye in the Sky (one of the years sleeper hits) the aspect of drones in the war playing field and also the increasing political red tape surrounding such tools of destruction, comes to the forefront in this often impressive but equally so frustrating white knuckle thriller that takes place over the space of a couple of tension riddled hours.

Offering an insight into how operations are often run these days, the task at hand in Eye in the Sky showcases a joint operation between England, America and on the ground officers in Africa, Hood's film starts off in a somewhat disorientating fashion as we're thrust from place to place and character to character before his film finds its groove in the middle section to make us feel as though we to are part of this operation to take down wanted terrorist figures before they set about enacting more acts of terror of the world.

In amongst the team tasked with leading this operation to success is Helen Mirren's stoic and determined British Colonel Katherine Powell and Mirren handles proceedings as well as to be expected although she is outshone by the late Alan Rickman in his final live action role as the equally determined Lieutenant General Frank Benson and Aaron Paul as American drone pilot with a conscience Steve Watts. It's a tricky balancing act for Hood to juggle all these components and while Eye in the Sky offers some intriguing moral questions the tale is often frustrating in execution (although this could be on purpose considering the infuriating nature on getting clearance from everyone on everything) and its emotional manipulation involving a poor bread selling child is a fairly weak way to get a point across.

Falling somewhere between a quality Hollywood thriller and an upper market BBC tele-film, Eye in the Sky opens the viewers eyes to drone warfare and our world climate but you can't help but feel as though there's still a further quintessential drone film to be made despite the experienced casts best efforts to elevate the material here.

Permalink",False,"So Many Questions....So Little Time.

There's Plenty of Suspension of Disbelief as well as Suspense in this Film that is Layers from Reality and is Inevitable when a Story asks so Many Important Moral, Political, and Ethical Issues in such a Confined Space.

Second, on a Technical Level, perhaps for the sake of the Viewer, the High-Def Images Displayed by the Drone and the ""Beetle"" are Impossibly Sharp, Clear, and Stable.

This is a Movie so Deep in Concerns of the Heart that it Completely Overwhelms the ""Collateral Damage"" Preconception that it becomes Totally Unbelievable and Forced into the Narrative to make its Philosophical Points. This is Juxtaposed with Military Counterpoints and ""The Beat Goes On"".

In the End it Tries Vigorously with Nail-Biting Emotion to Tell its Story with the ""War on Terror"" Suicide Bombers on Screen (never in closeup) to be the ""Ticking Time Bomb"" that Haunts, but Hardly ever Seems the Forefront Fascism that is the Cause of the Mission in the First Place.

The Gut-Churning Fate of the Innocent Little Girl, who just wants to Sell Bread and Play with Her Hula-Hoop is the Cosmic Heart of Humanity that Pleads for Peace in a World almost Always at War. If She Dies, like so many Before Her, were all of Their Deaths and Mutilations be Worth the Wars, it seems some Think so, although it does not End the Bloodshed.

There Never has been a ""War to End All Wars"" and the Sacrifices Tallied to Justify Victory Remain in the Crypt of Computational Statistics with Percentiles and Talk of Fog and Patriotism.

Permalink",True,"Traditional ""just war"" doctrine assumes two adversaries in a conflict in which both forces are held to generally accepted rules of conduct regarding noncombatants and collateral damage (including civilian casualties). Because there are ""front lines"", armies in uniform, and rather clear chains of command, who does what to whom can be policed, after a fashion and after the fact.

But in asymmetrical warfare conflicts, in which one adversary is weaker than the other in conventional armaments and so engages in guerrilla tactics, including terror attacks on innocent noncombatants and often seeks cover by embedding itself within a civilian population, those conditions, including safeguards for civilians, are absent.

The movie probes some of the moral issues in asymmetrical warfare, in which the world nowadays abounds. Are the terrorists guilty in locating their headquarters in a civilian area, or are their adversaries guilty in going after them there? But the plot is overly sensitive. In any current scenario, the trigger for the drone attack would have been pulled without hesitation. The premise for hesitation recalls some recent movie plots in which the bad guys kidnap a loved one of someone from which they want to extract information that would lead to the mass deaths of many more innocent people. The pressured individual invariably gives up that information, presumably saving their loved one while condemning many more (perhaps thousand and hundreds of thousands more)to death. In fiction,the personal always overcomes the abstract. Never mind that the loved one is invariably rescued and the evil plot thwarted. But what if they weren't, and the plot succeeded? War, as Sherman is reported to have said, IS hell.

Permalink",False,"This is the story behind the short newspaper articles we read now and then, like: 'Top terrorists killed by US rocket attack'. We read those stories without really knowing what goes on behind the scenes. This film shows us how those drone attacks really are carried out. And in doing so, it touches upon a lot of moral dilemmas. Should politicians have the last word about these attacks? Is it allowed to kill people who haven't yet done any harm, but are probably going to carry out a suicide attack? Is it acceptable that innocent bystanders are killed as well? If so, how many? Does it make any difference if the terrorists are US or UK citizens? The film shows that the answers to some of those questions come down to mere statistics. If the probability of civilian casualties within a certain range from the point of impact is over 50 percent, the attack is not allowed by the rules of engagement. If it is less than 50 percent, the attack can be carried out. But what if an innocent little girl will almost certainly get killed, a cute girl who minutes before was playing with a hula-hoop? Some characters in the film defend the case that one little girl's life is a small price to pay for saving many possible victims of a suicide attack. The ice cold British colonel who is in charge of the attack, played by Helen Mirren, is one of them. But the politicians who must give the operation the green light, are not so sure. One of them even is prepared to take the risk of letting the suicide attacker go, in order to save the little girl.

Apart from dealing with these moral issues, the film is also providing lots of suspense. Time is ticking away while the politicians are hesitating, the army colonel is pushing for a quick decision, and the terrorist are planning their attack. A very smart script feature is that the little girl is selling loaves of bread in front of the terrorist's house, which means that everybody is waiting for bread-buyers to turn up, in order for her to be able to go home and clear the ground for the attack.

This movie seems to tell the story almost entirely in real time, which is something I like very much. Films in real time have something special about them. Viewers are more easily drawn into a story without time lapses. Another nice feature is the use of incredibly sophisticated technical devices. I don't know if these devices are real or made up by the film makers. They are so spectacular that it's hard to believe these things really exist.

'Eye in the Sky' is an exciting war thriller, but goes beyond that and asks important questions about modern warfare. The good thing is that it's up to the viewer to give the answers.

One afterthought: the one thing I didn't like at all is the title. It's a lame title, better suited for a James Bond movie. It's not hard to think of something better. 'Operation Egret' is an obvious one. Or what about 'Clearance'? It has a nice double meaning - clearance for the operation to go ahead, and the clearance of terrorists on the ground."

Permalink",True,"Drone warfare has been a contentious subject ever since the first unmanned military aircraft snuck through our skies, and this masterful drama perfectly captures the many dimensions of the drone debate whilst delivering a tense and edgy thriller. After being introduced to Helen Mirren's Colonel Powell we learn that a few high value human targets, who haven't been locatable until now, have been unearthed in Kenya, and a capture mission is underway. It's not long before the mission goes awry. Following this single operation in what is close to real time, director Gavin Hood builds suspense by bouncing between multiple perspectives as events escalate and unravel, demonstrating just how many working parts and potential road blocks there are in achieving a military objective. Yet the film gives a voice to all sides of the argument and presents an intriguing and thought-provoking array of murky issues existing in the political, legal, military and human realms of fighting terrorism via drone warfare. Wisely, the exploration of this complex matter runs deep but no steadfast stance is taken. We see the unwavering militaristic viewpoint through two pairs of eyes, Mirren's weary intelligence officer Colonel Powell and Alan Rickman's pragmatic General Benson, who is back in London trying to extract an answer from the civilian leaders responsible for authorising drone attacks. Both are acting legends for a reason, and it's particularly moving to witness one of Rickman's final performances. In stark contrast to Powell and Benson's unfaltering outlook is that of Nevada-based wet-behind-the-ears drone pilots Lt. Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) and Lt. Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox), both uneasy with their role in the mission after observing a young girl living next door to the terrorist haven. Through Richard McCabe's Attorney General, Jeremy Northam's Minister and Monica Dolan's diplomat, we are also privy to the legal and political perspectives; scribe Guy Hibberd constructing these scenes with intelligence, maturity and subtlety, refusing to dumb it down into binary points of view. It's a shame there has been little publicity for this movie in Australia as Eye in the Sky is an absorbing, insightful and provocative motion picture that deserves a large audience.

Permalink",True,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****

This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....

This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.

There is really good production behind both the little ""eyes in the sky"" (drones and a beetle) and the whole situations delicacy. Great work digitally there!I has been a loooong time since I sat on needles for more than 10 minutes waiting on what is going to happen. Just of the top of my head, I can only refer to one other in 2016. So... about 40 minutes into the movie when clearance is urgent of a missile attack, it is made with such grace and excellence (speaking of editing, acting, directing, background music, visuals and authentic realism) that I were practically glued to the screen. Nice to see Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman (may he rest in peace) interact together; they make sparks, even it is is only through phone and computer.

There is an immense political issue during the whole concept and conveying of this movie. Is it ""right"" to take into consideration one single innocent girl if an estimated 50-80 people will be saved and three of a most wanted list in eliminated if the single girl is taken into collateral damage? I have my perspective clear on that one. Do you?

I recommend this movie. It is entertaining in more than one way, and almost the entire film is built around one little incident and the whole tension and political views of that. Interesting! Marvellous display of how all the aspects of one single target effects people in different ways. This motion picture shows the both worlds of being the target, being victims around that target, being a military officer buying a doll to a child and then walking into the office making a decision of eliminate that target involving political issues. The officer closes his computer and says farewell to a day at work. The parents on the other side of earth says fare well to their dead daughter.....

Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Higher standard that a typical British and/or American production. Great sound and good way of displaying the turns behind the decision makers around the world down to the single man releasing a missile. - The actors : Alan Rickman and Helen Mirren Says it all. Spot on! Could have been better to reach Academy Award nomination... still... astonishing! - The story : Very well put together. Well scripted, well written and greatly told. - Entertainment : Tons of tension in this one. See it. - Age : 15

7,7 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)

Permalink",False,"-Eye in the Sky is a 2015 British thriller film starring Helen Mirren, Aaron Paul, Alan Rickman and Barkhad Abdi. The film, directed by Gavin Hood based on a screenplay by Guy Hibbert, is about military personnel facing the legal, ethical and political dilemmas presented by drone warfare against those using terrorist tactics, and civilians who are endangered by it. It was filmed in South Africa in late 2014.

-The film premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival on 11 September 2015. Bleecker Street distributed the film in theaters in the United States with a limited release on 11 March 2016. Entertainment One plans to distribute the film in theaters in United Kingdom on 8 April 2016. It will also release the film in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand. It is one of two posthumous feature films starring Rickman, who died of pancreatic cancer in January 2016; the other is Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016).

--Critical response: -Eye in the Sky has received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 94%, based on 140 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""As taut as it is timely, Eye in the Sky offers a powerfully acted – and unusually cerebral – spin on the modern wartime political thriller."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".

-Rickman's performance was well received by critics, with Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times saying, ""Mr. Rickman was never nominated for an Academy Award and it's probably a long shot for a posthumous Supporting Actor for this film -- but his work here is a reminder of what a special talent he possessed."" -Dr. Peter Asaro on Science & Film reviewed the accuracy of the advanced military technology depicted in the film concluding, ""keep in mind that while some of the advanced technologies depicted are not yet out in the field, many are only a few years away from being a reality.""

Permalink",True,"Eye in the Sky is about drone warfare and the fight against terrorism. It's not a particularly unique premise for a movie, but Eye in the Sky approaches it in an entirely unique way. The entire film plays out in real time as we follow the various processes and procedures that go into a particularly complex surveillance mission. As the mission escalates into a potential kill shot, debates are had and lines are pushed all over the world. Colonel Powell commands the operation from a military HQ in England, with assistance from the Kenyan military on the ground, and the drone team in Nevada, overseen by Lt. General Benson and several key legal and political ministers. Throughout the movie's run time we also dip into the imaging analysis department at Pearl Harbour, as well as visit British and American politicians scattered over Asia on diplomatic missions.

This is a very wordy movie. As far as action goes, there isn't a whole lot of it, and what little action there is isn't particularly bombastic. The film relies on it's dialogue to propel the story, but don't for a moment think that makes it a boring watch. I was hooked on every word as they attempted to figure out the rules of engagement and debate on what exactly was acceptable loss. Due to it playing out in real time and hopping all over the world with an intimate look into the various military arms that go into this operation (rather than the typical small team in a large room surrounded by computers and large screens), it uses a couple of amusing character moments to weigh it all down. The general, for example, bookends the movie with searching for the right doll for his granddaughter, and the British foreign secretary struggles with a bought of food poisoning. This all offers an extra edge and humanity.

War movies almost always have some kind of message, whether it's a propaganda piece praising the heroes of war, or a cynical angle to promote an anti-war stance. Eye in the Sky's message is unclear. Superficially it reads as a matter-of-fact look at what it takes to engage a drone strike, without any political bias either way. And yet there are moments that could read either way. The problem of collateral damage permeates the entire film, with some characters judging it as acceptable when weighed against the alternative, and others finding it unacceptable in any situation. Would you save one innocent life and risk hundreds of others?

The key to this reasonably balanced examination of the dilemma is thanks to the sterling acting work on display. Aaron Paul is fast becoming known for the guy you cast if you want a teary- eyed, conflicted expression at any point, and he does it so well. You see the conflict he has inside him when he's told to pull the trigger, and can see that whatever he does is going to haunt him for his entire life. Helen Mirren on the other hand is uncompromising, even going so far as to bend the rules to get the outcome she desires. She's driven and determined, after six years of chasing her target. Alan Rickman is much more level-headed, and his final role definitely makes a mark. He holds the attention of the screen as well as all the actors he shares the room with. His subtle reactions to things show experience and wisdom, and his 'final' line is a poignant one that speaks volumes; ""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war.""

Eye in the Sky had me holding my breath and sat on the edge of my seat throughout. I got emotionally invested in the operation; those who were taking part, as well as those potential victims. It's certain to be a movie that will polarise the political mindsets of it's audience, as it neither promotes or berates military action in a foreign country. It is what it is, and this is how it works. Whether you're the minister who's disgusted by the proposition of potentially killing innocent people, or the Colonel who always sees at as a means to a very necessary end, I would definitely recommend Eye in the Sky. I give it an enthralling 8/10.

Only wish the South African director had put a bit more effort in recreating the real Kenya... e.g. some Kenyan license plates... nowadays very easy to use CGI to get real images of Parklands and Eastleigh, etc... That's the only gripe we from Kenya have... :)

Permalink",False,"'Eye in the Sky' is a timely, tension-filled story of a joint British/US operation to neutralize members of a terrorist cell in Kenya. The mission parameters change from capture to kill when the threat level rises, but things are complicated when a young neighborhood girl sets up her makeshift bread shop directly next to the building the terrorists are holed up in. Pretty much the entirety of the movie involves preparing for and the attempt to authorize the drone strike that the British military leaders (Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman) are determined to carry out. We see the physical, practical details (involving some technology that seems straight out of a James Bond movie) as well as the legal and political protocols that must be adhered to. The movie is so successful in immersing the viewer in the dilemma the military characters face that you feel their frustration at being thwarted by military protocols and indecisive politicians while simultaneously being terrified for the fate of the little girl. 'Eye in the Sky' shares many similarities with 'Sicario' in that it deals with a war, portrayed very graphically, in which the major characters largely travel in the gray areas of legality and morality.

Permalink",False,"So the audience is faced by this excruciating dilemma in a military operation, whether to kill one person as a collateral damage to save many others, or to let this one person live and risk losing more lives. Trying to determine the answer this difficult question are a collection of Reaper UAV pilots, military commanders, ministers, Prime Ministers and Presidents. What approach should you take in solving this issue; legal, political or ethical approach? And try finding a solution under the humongous pressure of time. Can you even stand your argumentative ground? Would you still have the courage and authority to give the word go?

This is the situation in the film Eye in the Sky, starring the ever- stoic Alan Rickman as General Benson (God bless his soul), Macchiavellian-with-a-heart Helen Mirren as Colonel Katherine, a drone pilot with a conscience Aaron Paul and of course our favourite Somali pirate Barkhad Abdi. The ensemble cast was directed flawlessly by Gavin Hood (of Ender's Game reputation) in a very real-time, life-like, supremely tense to and fro manner. But truly, the film unraveled itself as more of a challenge for the audience for we are faced with difficult issues such as the role of international law as either a guide or a means to justify political actions, the role of States as a legitimate user of violence in a Rousseauean sense, and ultimately, when commmanders and ministers just can't independently determine whether to kill or not to kill, we are faced with the ultimate moral question, is it ever justifiable for a human being to take another human being's life, regardless of any justification provided by national interest and/or international humanitarian law.

This film will challenge your views, it will expand your horizons precisely because NONE of the characters in the story possessed a higher moral and ethical ground than others. Every argument counts, and every argument could also be discounted. Every thought can be justified yet can be rebuked at any time. Such is the fickle nature of man, trying as they might to exercise the so-called powers of the state, just to end up trapped in the endless simulacra of moral, legal and ethical trilemma. Then again, despite all the moral, legal and ethical debates happening in the comfort of a government office or a far- flung military base, an extrajudicial killing is STILL an extrajudicial killing.

This might be one of the best antiwar film ever made. And for sure, this is the most important antiwar film for our era. I can't recommend this film highly enough. if you plan to see only one film in 2016. make sure it's Eye in the Sky."

Permalink",True,"Treading the same path traversed by Andrew 'Gattaca' Niccol's 'Good kill', which I'm yet to watch, this one had me worried for 2 reasons:

1. How would it compare to 'Homeland' (and the Israeli series it is based upon, translated, 'Prisoners of war')?

2. Director Gavin Hood, who displayed talent when it came to 'Tsotsi' and 'Rendition', but spectacularly lost it when it came to 'X-Men origins: Wolverine'.

Before I try and address those, let me get a few things outta the way first.

This is a movie in which surveillance equipment, a(n electronic) beetle in particular, end up having equal, if not more, significant roles, as the plot does or its (en)actors do, making everyone in developing countries wonder about the price we all need to keep paying for protection. Ppl settled in developed worlds can debate about security and privacy all they want, from the comfort of their couches and their coffee tables, since the lives being lost, for them, are purely theoretical, and occur worlds away (and it is easy to make oneself immune to that kinda carnage, when its not as real).

Having said that, calling this an Indie might be a misnomer, since it follows, or tries to, 2-3 acts, plus varying character arcs, on its way to the conclusion, playing to the galleries, both in terms of actual lives being laid on the line, on-purpose/inadvertently, plus in terms of the lines it gives Alan Rickman's character who looks at anyone who's non-military with absolute disdain (in the way only 'Hans Gruber' can) while showing/telling them their place quite frequently, and their cause is not helped by the likes of weakly- written (IMO, on purpose) characters played by Monica Dolan and Jeremy Northam's (not to mention Iain Glen's or the actor playing the US Secretary of State, doing interesting/far-more-important things in Beijing).

This one, on occasion, almost takes on the tone of a satire, for instance, when it goes to an arms fair in Singapore, or 'that interesting place' in Beijing; that, for my money and time, Armando Iannucci's 'In the loop' did far, far better on (for that matter, HBO's 'Veep' too did a great job on, with most of the talent in front of and behind the camera being alums of 'In the loop'). My review of that movie here - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226774/reviews-136.

Having your movie callback an original work of art, with a sigh of wishful (maybe even wistful) thinking, in the midst of your own movie, can never be something good.

But yeah, that happened.

I'm also still unsure about the (artistic?) decision with regard to not allowing English sub-titles to be displayed when character speak 'Swahili', for more than 20% of the movie's running time (ignore that IMDb lists the language only as English), but that definitely detracted from the movie-viewing experience, since the communication was not just large/jingoistic beats being exchanged. A friend of mine loves to say that he/she prefer it that way, but I sure don't, since I'm here to understand what's going on, not to learn an exotic language.

But, in spite of all that, and in spite of goofs like having a 'Colonel' being called 'Captain' (intentionally? I don't think so), this one actually does redeem itself by doing a couple of things towards its finalé that I did not see it choosing as the better of the options available (from a writing perspective), especially since setting one of those up seemed like an awful lot of hard work to do in the first place.

Bravo! And that includes the 45-65 sequence ('nuff said) with Mirren. And to think that role was written for a male actor (a la 'Salt' being written for Cruise, but ended up being played by Jolie).

The performances are top-notch, but Aaron Paul and Phoebe Cox don't get that emoting need not be in-your-face (to be fair to them, they were perhaps aided/prodded by, Hood himself), and can be communicated with a glance as well.

From the sledgehammer-school-of-acting, as it were.

Monica Dolan makes for a good Emily Watson (type), and could have perhaps done better with deeper characterization.

Not fair to have her or Northam's characters dismissed as quasi couch politico-types, that Rickman successfully does with his glances and words, all-thru, and if the point was to make us try and see that the makers were impartial, that does not come thru at all, since they definitely take a stand (like a recent movie called 'Talvar' did, on an entirely different true crime based plot), and that's firmly rooted with the soldiers fighting the wars, and this is a case for the proverbial 'eye in the sky' to be more than just that, the way it already is. The powers-that-be can use this to make their case, almost like a recruitment reel.

But yeah, this can also make a case for remote teams working in tandem, making decisions together, dealing with ambiguity and abstraction, interpreting existing rules (RoE) to mean what your idea of the greater good is (though, to be fair, if what happens did not, a strong case can be made of a 'clear and present danger' to the population at large, a fact that the movie drills into our heads time and again with its characteristic lack of subtlety).

To me, that kinda made all the difference in the end, due to which I can wholeheartedly recommend this for a large-screen viewing (the local censor board outdoes themselves once again with all the effd up muting that's been going on, so perhaps a big-screen theatrical viewing in a place that knows how to respect the cinematic arts is preferable), hopefully, with a decent audience, that can desist from WhatsApp'ing or Tindering during (as you can guess, I wasn't very lucky).

Permalink",True,"This is not a typical review but more of an expression on my thought about the ending, which brought my rating down a star.

Before I get to that, I have to commend the acting--wonderful, as expected from Aaron Paul, Helen Mirren, and the late Alan Rickman. All three act so well with so little words. Loved it.

Now for the ending and the treatment of collateral. Having the concerned party fixate on the little girl--and JUST her for so long-- did not sit well with me. Everyone else on that street besides some of the soldiers were equally innocent, especially the girl's parents next door.

Most of the things they debated on were mostly for their own comfort. Estimates are always estimates.

And the ending? She died, as the estimate said. But I felt it would have been more gut-wrenching to have the consequences linger. Her parents could have died and left her alone and alive, showing the ignorance of those involved in how there is more than a girl--there is a family, too, that may be destroyed. (For the sake of writing they may have simplified it, but it was too negligent for me that no one talked about anyone else at length but the girl. That, by itself, is already a sign of narrow-mindedness/ignorance.) The girl could have survived, but have been maimed, as do many, many survivors of war. That is a population we can attempt to support, like with Agent Orange survivors in the Vietnam War.

If the writers were going to have something bad happen, it could have had more impact if it was something unplanned in the immediate aftermath. (Maybe they didn't want Aaron Paul to have more breakdowns than he did in Breaking Bad or will have in The Path.)

Other than that, the film really raises a topic that many people need to think about because it is a reality. And if you don't think about it, you are willfully ignorant to how the world is affected by the United States and the United Kingdom.

Oppressing others is human nature. We can only try to be thorough in our decisions and not to destroy more than necessary.

Permalink",False,"""Eye in the sky"" is a political/war drama about a British intelligence agent (Helen Mirren) who receives Intel that top East African terrorists are all residing in a house in Nairobi, Kenya. The task force is getting ready to bomb the house with a drone when their surveillance notices a girl selling bread by the house. The film turns into a compelling look at the philosophy of morality and the weighing of the loss of collateral damage against the risk for larger loss of life. Mirren and company refer up to get approval as to when to fire the bombs because of the moral implications there would be to bomb the house with the girl in such close proximity. I thought the movie presented a humanistic and fascinating look at the political and social implications of their decision and showed that there is great cost in war.

Permalink",False,"A suicide squad owing allegiance to al-shabaab is getting ready to embark on a deadly mission in Nairobi. Their actions are being monitored by a tiny drone camera, disguised as a beetle. Watching intently is a colonel (Helen Mirren) sitting in her plush drawing room in London. She is in touch with a pilot who is sitting inside a bunker somewhere in Nevada. His finger is on the trigger to launch a missile that can neutralize the terrorists. Welcome to the new-age of counter-terrorism, so deftly captured by Eye in the Sky.

When the pilot is about to pull the trigger, a chirpy little girl walks into his cross-hair. She is selling bread and sets up a table adjoining the compound where the terrorists are holed-up. The moral compass of the pilot does not allow him to pull the trigger.

The moral predicament is kicked upstairs. The quandary involving military, lawyers, bureaucrats and ministers spans time-zones across 4 continents. As time ticks inexorably, the buck keeps passing back and forth. Sadly, the tension didn't get to me, though my intellect was sufficiently tickled by the arguments. I felt I was watching from Moon or somewhere else in space.

Eye in the Sky has an original premise but fails to grab the eyeballs. I left the theatre a bit sad and a tad scared."

Permalink",True,"PLOT IS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL HERE. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM AND IF YOU WISH TO AVOID ""SPOILERS,"" STOP READING NOW. COME BACK AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE. 'NUFF SAID?

.

Fairly good suspense but that's pretty much it. What I got from watching the film is probably not what the writers or director had in mind -- but I do not know that. For me the story reveals the problems faced by dithering national management. Compare and contrast the one extreme (that of so-called ""terrorists"") who do not value human life at all, with the extreme of the gutless hand-wringing and anxiety people experience when they are hired to do a job for which they are not suited and for which they have not been properly trained. Almost a re-play of the Hiroshima whining of the 1950's and 1960's. Here, we are supposed to identify with the little girl and her father because they were resisting the anti-female dogma of the local culture. Okay, we're all down with that. Next we see would-be armchair commandos doing their own dithering and hand wringing. If the locals knew the little girl learned how to read they probably would have tortured her to death anyway. But no, we see the weeping trigger jockeys in Nevada who drop drones on folks all day, everyday, but who are, on this day, all consumed with the Hula-Hoop Girl. For those who think the take-away is that drones are a bad thing, think again. Morality is never a numbers game: one life sacrificed versus many lives potentially saved. No, the real take-away here is much simpler: do your job or find another one. Again: the wages of dithering are depression. On the other hand, in most U.S. cities, the little girl would be arrested for not having a business license and a commercial baker's guild license.

Permalink",False,"Review: I quite enjoyed the intensity throughout this movie, and I'm sure that the subject matter and overall outcome, will rise a debate from its fellow viewers. Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren), is quite a radical officer, who sends commands to 2 other officers, Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) and Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox), who are controlling drones, which are set to take out a group of terrorists. The only problem is that there is a young girl selling bread in the area, so the question is, do you take out the terrorists, which will damage the young girl, or do you wait for her to sell the bread and leave the area? This is the intense part of the movie, which I quite enjoyed, and you have this whole politics element which seemed like each politician just wanted to pass the buck to each other. Whilst waiting for the critical commands from there superiors, Steve and Carrie are hoping that the girl gets out of the way so they can stop the terrorists, who are being armed with suicide bombs. It is a ""edge of your seat"" storyline, which is portrayed well by the top cast but once you know the outcome, I can't see people watching it time and time again. Its good to see different the sides of war, and the collateral damage which can cause such a big impact on innocent families but the question still remains, is one girls life really worth saving, for the cost of a group of suicide bombers, who can cause mass destruction! Although the movie is based on saving a young girl, there are much more people in the area who will also be damaged, or killed by the hellfire, so the movie was definitely an eye opener, and quite enjoyable, especially as it was Alan Rickman's final movie. Enjoyable!

Round-Up: With so many different locations, and a low budget, South African born, Gavin Wood, 53, done a great job putting this intense drama together, and he chose the right actors to play there roles. His previous movies include, A Reasonable Man in 1999, A Desert and Wilderness, Tsotsi, Rendition, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Ender's Game in 2013. He certainly has covered a few genres in his career and he has worked with a variety of actors, so this movie was a great choice, after the disappointing Ender's Game. He showed a different side to Helen Mirren, who at 70 years old, is still pulling out great performances, and with the use of today's technology, he was able to show how drones are the future of war. After sadly losing Alan Rickman, who died of Cancer in January 2016, it was good to see that his last movie was pretty decent, although he will be remembered for playing Hans Gruber in the original Die Hard. With Colin Firth as the producer, I'm sure this film will rise eyebrows and make people think how much Big Brother is watching.

Budget: $13million Worldwide Gross: $19million

I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/war/thrillers starring Helen Mirren, Aaron Paul, Alan Rickman, Barkhad Abdi, Iain Glen, Jessica Jones, Bob Chappell and Phobe Fox. 5/10"

Permalink",True,"That's what many of us ignore. ""the question"". So here is a little effort; a reminder.

So the movie starts very casually and also hiding ""the dream"" in a very generic way. It starts with people being gently put on to their roles. Very brief intro of characters; thus you get into the movie with a blink of an eye & STAY INSIDE THE WHOLE TIME by the beautifully written plot line.

Pretty fast you get to know almost the whole plot. (Which might be opposing to my 8 rating!!) Its about the clash of the powerful, in the process to stay powerful; without a care for the rest around them. And what the movie constantly shows that they do not have any option; that they are forced to do what they are doing. But at the same time the story line constantly superimposes the fact that many a times they actually try to do right, they try to be human. (talking about the military actions and the way they keep pushing the decision just to have a clear conscience & also a single line of frames where the terrorists agrees to help the little girl in the ending). And at last the movie finishes up with ""the dream"" of the little girl.

The essence of any great movie is the plot line and THE QUESTION. Now you might get different questions in your head. But here is what I got at the end.

""Who wronged the little girl?""

Is it the military, the good people as we know? Is it the bad people with the guns? Is it the color she was born with? Is it her father who chose to live there? Is it her mother who sent her to sell bread? etc etc...

And the fact for which I liked the movie (And the question) most is... it all boils down to one person/idea/religion, of which there is not even a single direct mentioning in the whole movie.

Permalink",False,"'Eye in the Sky' is a Gripping & Intense Thriller, that makes you think. Its thought-provoking as well as its brilliant. And The Stellar Cast, led by The Late/Great Alan Rickman, are in top-form!

'Eye in the Sky' Synopsis: Col. Katherine Powell, a military officer in command of an operation to capture terrorists in Kenya, sees her mission escalate when a girl enters the kill zone triggering an international dispute over the implications of modern warfare.

'Eye in the Sky' is a tale of war, violence & authority. We get to see the people in suit, trying to get rid of the evils of our society, but have to decide to weather kill them instantly of wait till an innocent girl leaves the zone. Its a very thought provoking film about how every life matters & how one has to take a decision, in such drastic, turbulent times.

'Eye in the Sky' warms up slowly, but once it does, oh boy! The second-hour is spell-binding. I was engrossed & hooked onto my seat. The culmination, too, leaves a huge impact.

Guy Hibbert's Screenplay is truly superb. The proceedings are gripping & engrossing. Gavin Hood's Direction is very well-done. Amongst his best works! Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is sharp. Art & Costume Design are pitch-perfect. Background Score is fabulous.

Performance-Wise: The Late/Great Alan Rickman commands the screen. He's simply flawless as the Lieutenant General. He's truly missed! Helen Mirren is extraordinary, yet again! What a captivating performance! Aaron Paul is first-rate. Barkhad Abdi is once again in good form. Iain Glen leaves a mark. Others lend remarkable support.

On the whole, 'Eye in the Sky' makes for a Solid Watch!"

Permalink",True,"I watched this film having heard nothing about it. At first, I thought it was going to be an anti-war agenda flick, but was proved incorrect. The use of drones in selected assassinations is examined from all sides. Is there such a thing as acceptable ""collateral damage""? Does sacrificing a few innocents justify saving many more? The bureaucracy of passing the buck from one politician to another may be exaggerated, but is probably not too far from the truth. My only complaint is how the drone pilots were portrayed. I do not believe U.S. Air Force pilots would refuse or delay an order to launch. They are trained to follow orders, although I also doubt a British Colonel would be giving direct orders to an American Lieutenant. I still recommend this movie as thought provoking and well worth your time.

Permalink",False,"Welcome to war in the 21st Century - where the warriors sit in front of computer consoles drinking coffee as they (or their superiors) decide who lives and who dies. Whether you kill someone with a rifle or a mouse click, you've killed. So, there is no moral dilemma in the killing part that didn't already exist prior to computers.

On collateral damage, well ... let me say something that's politically incorrect. People who live in countries with oppressive rulers have 3 choices:

1) Stay behind and join a resistance movement to overthrow the rulers.

2) Flee (refugees).

3) Stay behind and tacitly ""accept"" their oppression.

If the people in category 1 are killed by so-called ""friendly fire,"" that would be morally hurtful ... as it should be. The people in category 2 probably aren't around to be killed. But the people in category 3? Edmund Burke is famously quoted as saying ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" So, if people like that get killed, tough. They made their own bed and must now lie in it. And if they have innocent children who end up being killed, it's THE PARENTS' moral dilemma, not the fault of the people fighting the oppression.

Sadly, it's people in category 3 who end up being used as human shields - primarily so oppressors can ""blame"" their enemies for collateral deaths. And like I said, I have no sympathy for people in category 3 - especially parents of children in that category who may ""say"" they love their children but, by virtue of their non-resistance, prove otherwise.

I'm a Vietnam vet who knows what war is like. And as Alan Rickman's character so eloquently put it in the film, ""Never tell a soldier that he doesn't understand the cost of war."" Had it been me in front of that keyboard, I'd have clicked the mouse with no regret ... knowing that I'd killed 3 people responsible for the deaths of countless others. Or, as Spock put it once in a Star Trek movie, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few ... or the one."" I took away 2 stars from this review primarily because of the interactions between British political persons - and their hesitation to do what was ultimately the right thing to do. It reminded me a lot of Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" movie. Brian is crucified and Judith pleads with the People's Front of Judea to ""do"" something before he dies. Their response? John Cleese (the PFJ leader) says, ""Right! This calls for an immediate discussion!"" Uh-huh."

Permalink",False,"I've read the reviews and seldom have seen such diverse reactions to a film. The pendulum swings wide here with comments ranging from terrible, unrealistic, rubbish, propaganda, characters not suited to the role (have I missed any?) to superb. How can one film spawn so many different reactions! My only conclusion is that many have watched this film with a preconceived opinion about drone warfare, if not war itself. This ""don't confuse me with facts"" obscures the brilliance of the script and the cast (not the least of which is Helen Mirren who is, well, Helen Mirren says it all.) And to those who might say she is too old for the role, what is this, another Barbra Streisand was too old to play Yenta? Get a life! Don't you have anything else to throw at it? ""Eye in the Sky"" is probably technically accurate in it's display of state-of-the-art technology, or at least as accurate as civilians are able to know. The essentials of the film are the roles of the military, civilian authority, political consequences, the moral doubts that exist in a civilized culture, often at odds with one another. It weaves these elements together and the viewer is forced to consider which is right or wrong. But in the end there is no right or wrong. It is the contradictions that exist in a democracy and the one that leads to the decision to bomb the ignorant killing bastards, even with collateral damage. We as civilized nations, not without faults, some serious, have to endure this. Those forces are clearly evident in this film, and the viewer must go along for the ride.

Permalink",False,"For me this movie was a must watch. Loving indie movies and loving war movies seemed like the perfect match. The preview is a little misguiding, I must say. I thought the movie wasn't going to be exactly what it was when I finally watched in, per the previews. Nonetheless, this movie hit me in many ways. The emotional thriller ride it takes the viewer on is quite a slow burning heart-attack. For me, the most important aspect of this movie was not only the different views between the factions of Parliament in the UK & Factions of parties of US and in the British Military, but the meaning of life. This movie, for me, stood for the meaning of life, not just in general, but as in 1 single person. How one person would be affected by an action that cannot be undone.

The characters and the cast were beautifully cast. Hellen Mirren was fantastic and I don't think I've seen her in this type of character before. That being said, I believe this is must watch for those only who can sit through a slower movie, though heavy heavy weighted. It had several aspects of a movie from last year, Good Kill, with Ethan Hawke. Almost a Dejavu moment. A totally different plot/characters etc, yet still similar.

I would had given 10 stars, however I feel as though more background could have been provided on pretty much everyone in the move. But An otherwise, well done!"

Permalink",False,"All I can say for this film is Helen,Helen,Helen.I love this woman's acting prowess I mean wow. Rickman was not too bad either.Congrats to Gavin for wearing his director belt for this one too. Kim's accent sounds fantastic. I really wish that the people in charge of the kind of military strikes depicted in this movie were capable of considering innocent civilians like the little girl. In my view this film shows that while it can be considered there is no real way around sacrificing a few innocent lives for the greater good.

This film is also a good depiction of the moral dilemma the role players who find themselves in similar situations face. One has to be a certain type of person to be able to do what is required under the circumstances and at any costs. My verdict, I really like this film even though it is a little slim on action.

Permalink",True,"There is a lot of realism and satire in this movie: The politicians who are suppose to make the decisions passing the ball to each other because nobody wants to take the blame.

The political aids who are suppose to contribute different opinions giving one dimensional arguments fueled only by personal emotions.

The military commanders who are suppose to get things done being frustrated at every step by red tape.

The specialists who are suppose to give impartial analysis being pressured by their boss to spin reports.

The operatives on the ground being controlled like drones and risking their lives for missions they have no input in.

And of course the very real consequences for very real people's lives on the ground being decided by committee over video phone conference on the other side of world.

So would I recommend you or anyone to see this movie? Let me show you a quote from the movie: ""The legal argument is that we could wait, but we need not wait. And the military argument is that we should not wait. It's my recommendation that we should not delay in proceeding with this mission."" Did you understand what he is trying to do here? Would you enjoy watching a movie where a bunch of people talk like this for the entire movie and not much else happens? If you answered yes to both of these questions, you will love this movie, otherwise you are better off seeing something else.

Permalink",False,"The opening sixty seconds of the film set the tone perfectly: as the image of a young girl playing happily is soon juxtaposed with the sight of military vehicles that patrol the streets around her Kenyan home, the discomforting mood is established immediately, and is unrelenting over the course of the film.

The majority of the film focuses on debates between several military and government figures, as they debate the logistics, politics, legality and morality of an attack to be carried out against extremists. The complexity of the characters, and indeed their predicament, is portrayed brilliantly through the actors and the script. Though I must confess that I haven't seen a lot of Helen Mirren's films, this is a striking role for her as the formidable colonel, whose screen presence is as commanding as her character. Alan Rickman, of course, is charming as usual, as he provides much needed moments of deadpan humour while ably and sensitively showing the burden the situation has on his character.

Turning to Aaron Paul, I almost hate to mention his career beginnings in Breaking Bad. We all know he was phenomenal in that; yet it seems that every character he has played before or since has not been too dissimilar. One might have wondered whether he was a good actor, or simply good at being Jesse Pinkman. However, his matured performance here may allow him to escape that typecast, as he continues to exquisitely showcase his emotional range while maintaining the right amount of restraint as appropriate to his character.

As the film continues, the tension builds and the plot thickens, the audience is scarcely given any time to relax, as the impossible situation multiplies in complexity and danger with each passing moment. What the film does so capably is to develop the viewer's understanding of the military world, and the current situation which continues to threaten the real world. What is painfully obvious is that no matter how well trained the characters think they may be, nothing can truly prepare anybody for situations like these. Guy Hibbert's dialogue is so well written and delivered, the viewer is constantly pulled between one side and the other; I found myself siding with arguments and characters I could never have seen myself agreeing with before.

Accompanied by a simplistic yet foreboding musical score and sharp, calculated editing, Eye in the Sky makes sure action takes the back seat, while allowing for character exposition, expert suspense building and tearing its audience apart with moral challenges to which, as it becomes clear, there is absolutely no winner. This isn't just food for thought – it's an all-you-can-eat intellectual buffet."

Permalink",False,"Let's just start with all the good. This movie is an extremely suspenseful film about the morality of people. It's a political thriller that is about two governments trying to agree on whether they should kill a terrorist group by hell-fire missiles, capture them, or not take the risk just because there's a little girl nearby the building. It is a movie that is thought provoking and makes you question your own morality with the situation. I loved this aspect of the movie and the last two acts of the film are spectacular. The ending is by far one of my favorite endings of this year. This is all the good I will throw at the movie but like I said about the last 2 acts of the film yet I can't say the same about the first act. The first act of the movie feels slow and is just a set up to the rest of the movie. You barely understand what is going on in the beginning of the film and don't really feel engaged until about 20 minutes into it. The only other flaw I really see with the movie but it can be annoying is the way some of the suspense is built up. Most movies build up suspense by trying different things and giving the characters new obstacles. This movie builds suspense by doing the exact same thing about ten times in a row. The suspense is still building but at the same time it's repetitive and predictable on what will happen next until you reach the conclusion. The ""same thing happening over and over"" that I am referring to is the governments needing to get the approval by everyone for this missile strike!! I understand they want to be realistic but don't sacrifice suspense and don't annoy your audience just because you want to put the same obstacle in the movie about ten times. This was still a great movie though and the ending alone is worth the price of admission!! 7/10

Permalink",False,"In this modern era, western governments try to avoid boots on the ground. Depending on aerial drones for surveillance and missile attacks. This film successfully shows the human cost to the soldiers and civilians involved in the process of executing drone attacks.

This is not a video game. Drone attacks are preceded by extensive intelligence work and the impact area is displayed on live video. Where there are civilian casualties, it is not a clean kill.

In this film, terrorists are about to carry out suicide attacks. The rules of engagement allow political leaders to authorize a pre-emptive strike. However, a single little girl (selling bread) is in the kill zone.

The civilians waffle as they pass the buck. The mission commander (Helen Mirren) is focused on her prey. The rookie crew of the drone are horrified. The drone pilot (Aaron Paul) had signed up because he needed to pay off his student loans.

This film (just 102 minutes) is merely an episode in the war with the terrorists. Their brutal tactics necessitating a brutal response. Very few clean kills here because of the moral ambiguity of sacrificing a few lives to save many. No one walks away with their head held high."

Permalink",True,"I had a hard time getting into the theatre for a film with such an unappealing premise. HOWEVER, I had to see the beloved, now iconic, Alan Rickman give his last film performance. And, while glad I saw the movie, in honor of him, and because there were several deeply moving, excellent, spot-on performances (especially Aaron Paul and Barkhad Abdi), I was unnecessarily distracted, even irritated by Helen Mirren's dialed-in performance, which included a great deal of pushing back her stylish forelock. Her work worthy of an over-intense ingénue or a jaded veteran actress. All the inner strength of her Prospero absent. C'mon! Mirren aside, what was a great moment (of many, many great moments)? The tension of the situation has continued to build, and the clock is ticking, when Jeremy Northam, sitting with the Ministry for Defense, takes off his jacket and reveals dark sweat stains in the armpits of his gorgeously, almost laughably fashionable blue shirt. Real sweat. Real fear. Real pain.

Permalink",True,"(Flash Review)

This movie is basically a debate about innocent casualties of war and ethical decisions. The story is based around a potential drone strike of the US's #2,3, & 5 most wanted terrorists in Kenya. Politicians and soldiers debate on launching a missile as there is one little girl selling bread next to the target structure. Some nifty spying has proof that these men are loading up weapons for a potential suicide mission and if they are bombed they'll potentially save 20-80 other innocent people. So do you launch the strike and risk killing the one girl selling bread? The debate uses the lion's share of the runtime. I felt the film to be unbelievable as the leaders and soldiers would have rules for these scenarios and certain solders would not have the reactions and take the actions they do in the movie. Putting that aside the movie was well-produced and tense but was also less about spying that I was lead to believe. Overall, it was a fake attempt to stir debate over the ethics of war which they cover points from both sides thoroughly.

The good points: Very good pacing, really cool bugs(LOL), smart(once or twice) and fun explosion scenes... I did some great sketching while listening to the movie and only momentarily watching to see something blow up!

****SPOILERS*****

and now the bad............

You mean to tell me that if that was Osama Bin Laden's ass on radar they wouldn't give a damn about some black girl selling bread! I'm being honest here. No racial hatred in anyway. I'm just calling them as I see them and because this is in present day Somalia. They would of nuked that place twice!!! Yes it is sad the little girl selling bread died. However, I really doubt if she was the only person killed when you blast off 2 hell-fire missiles launched at a target full of suicide vests and CONFIRMED EXPLOSIVES. It's a wonder anything was left but a big hole where that village used to be. This movie is so boring it is like a day of your life at the office. Now I can't say that this is official procedure or not, but damn why are so many hands tossing the ball back and forth like this was an NBA game? No wonder governments suck and the Military gets the blame. So at the 15 minute mark I was bored and grabbed my sketch book. Only looking up and going backwards when something blew up.

Watch a Tom Clancy movie or some 80's action movie. Because you will thank me from saving you from a movie that teases and teases and teases and then runs away. Boring as a day at work. Wait, I already said that! Must mean it is really try! :)

Permalink",True,"As a movie which (no spoilers) explores a wide range of issues that we believe we understand to be true about the current state of our world and the seeming conflict between maniac suicide Muslim bombers and the innocents in Africa and the western counties, the movie is excellent. it is emotional, and explores morality and the idea of sacrifice of 1 for many. But, and this is a big but... the real issue is nothing to do with religion or political ideas at all. The is well crafted but is many ways is, itself a propaganda fiction.

First of all, how many people are killed by suicide bombers? Very few!

Second, is there any real conflict between ordinary people who just want to eat, sleep, meet each other, get on, no matter what ideology they are indoctrinated with since birth?

The film is just indoctrinating a false illusion that the west is under constant threat of 'an enemy' and to destroy that enemy we have to question 'collateral damage'.

This is surface thinking. The real enemy is how one system collides with another. How hate and fear and thoughts of revenge or how conflict might solve this issue.

In our 'dumbed down' world, I am sure this film has a place to up ideas, but it misses the bigger ideas of western superiority of poorly resourced countries exploiting religious themes against political and pyramid down structures of control and self serving ruling systems.

For example, the western world is not interested in providing clean water in the poor countries, oil rich-many of them, or ensuring their systems of government are not ruthless families having a jolly at the expense of their populace: Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria... they just(WE) just want the oil!

This film although a great film for looking at ethics, unfortunately, through it's device of considering the ethics of human love as opposed to human control, misses the mark.

Should a surgeon under financial stress save this person or that one? It's a pity this film, which you should watch, unfortunately, took the current world 'globalisation', oil-seeking win-all resources idea conflicting with the religious lead mad people who really wish to usurp their ruthless western puppet dictators and controllers of oil, scenario as the stage on which to place the idea of human ethics against the idea of killing one to save more than one.

Such ideas could have been scripted to be explored outside of the current International stage of politic, capitalist intent, religious power intent (both equal with their fundamental self-serving ideas of duping the people by systems which gather money to the few, and instead explored such ideas without supporting the false believes, mania, false news, propaganda, and the money trail which supported the making f this film in the first place.

Just more dumbing down here dressed up as profound. If you want to do 'profound' best to do it outside of news-worthy and controlled propaganda. This film supports (innocently) a false idea of the world and adds to the ideas of a populace controlled by ruthless and faceless people. Great film which accomplishes nothing more than a continuation of the status Quo.

Questioning what is the right decision, and told from numerous perspectives, a pair of pilots who have never had to kill, a colonel who is willing to do almost anything to accomplish the mission, and political leaders. It shows you how every life taken was a human, who lived, breathed, and was loved by others. Intentionally killing an innocent person for the greater good is a much bigger complication than most believe.

Several scenes were incredibly beautiful, such as the terrorists, who are supposed to be degenerate scumbags, helping the girl. And the generals line ""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of a war."" Words cannot describe the moment.

Permalink",False,"Serious, compelling but perhaps over-schematic thriller concerning the ethics of warfare.

Although the drone technology on display is up-to-date, the movie itself is redolent of American 'moral debate' films made after the Second World War. 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' is probably the most famous, but the one that came to mind when watching 'EYE IN THE SKY' was John Frankenheimer's equally taut 'SEVEN DAYS IN MAY about a military coup threatening the White House, in which the arguments pro and con are represented by characters played by Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. Here we have more participants, more points of view to take into account before Helen Mirren, in command of the military operation, can give the order to Aaron Paul for a lethal strike on an enemy.

The issues are presented clearly, as is the jockeying for primacy. But the clarity is, perhaps deliberately, a distancing factor. It prevents emotional engagement, which the filmmakers then try to recover through non-stop music and heartbeat sound effects. The result is a bit of a muddle artistically.

However, the movie is expertly filmed and edited. It is definitely worth seeing, not least because it is Alan Rickman's final screen performance, and he is absolutely brilliant ."

But if you like your tension filmed movie to have a voice, to be critical, to challenge you, to get you to the edge (not only of your seat). You should be aware that while this is fictional, it's very likely that scenarios like this have happened in some form or another.

The movie also is good at depicting it's story in a confined space and a confined time, that is more than believable. Which also is true for the characters portrayed in this. Everyone has an agenda and everyone has their own ""right"". It's tough and I wouldn't want to have to make such decisions, that's for sure.

Permalink",False,"I really enjoyed this film. Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman were a delight to watch. There was considerable tension and suspense in the film. The moral ambiguity of the fog of war was fascinating. The supporting cast were all great in their spots. On that basis alone I'd highly recommend the film.

But when one really thought about it as good as Mirren and Rickman were the credibility was a bit stretched that both at their age would still be positions like that. Mirren's position for sure would have been occupied by a man (no offence to women that is just the way it is). I can't imagine either the US or the Brits having that kind of moral ambiguity. They usually don't seem to care a lot about collateral damage. They either deny the collateral damage or if caught out they say oops we made a mistake and promise to investigate or they just dismiss it as nonsense we were killing terrorists.

I can't imagine those two that were playing the pilots who had to pull the trigger hesitating like that. They'd be court martialled. It was my first reaction as I said you're kidding you can't decide that your job is to pull the trigger.

I may agree with the moral ambiguity about bombing so called terrorists (remember one man's terrorist is the other man's freedom fighter - and the US and Britain don't live there - the people live there its their country not the US's and Britain's). So when you hear that the US bombed a hospital in Afghanistan or bombed Syrian troops and then they say oops we made a mistake my reaction is no you did not make a mistake you knew what you were doing.

The US and Britain have got us into these wars because they want to control these countries. But they now are risking WW3 because of their desire to control and exercise hegemony over these countries. And yes over Russia as well. The moral ambiguities depicted in the film may have made for great film drama but I doubt the US and Britain really care. They want to win no matter what the cost in lives. The US since 2001 have spent $4.5 trillion on the wars and cost the lives of millions as well as contributing to the refugee disaster. No one can tell me that Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria and Yemen today are better off today then they were under Saddam, Qaddafi and Assad and others. They may have been brutes but they kept things in order. Their mistake was to challenge US hegemony over the Mid East. But the US does such a great job of manipulating the population they make it sound like it was their fault.

But Mirren and Rickman were a delight to watch and on that basis alone I enjoyed the film."

Permalink",False,"I can't see this film as an insider. I don't know enough about the realities of drone warfare. I would be surprised that those chosen to do the jobs would be so indecisive. Either you do the work of finding the worst of the worst and act on it, or you don't do it at all. To be so badly trained for the possibility of dealing with civilian casualties should probably be grounds for never being in this position. I'm not saying there is no room for compassion, but, let's face it, the people they were honing in on we're capable of a thousand times worse activity. The movie is contrived because if the bread salesman had been an emaciated, middle aged woman, I doubt that there would have been hesitation. It pulls at our heartstrings, right. The person I was most fearful for was the man who put his life in danger again and again, using devices to spy on the little compound. But he is also victimized by the filmmaker. He is careless with his remote control device, allowing that little boy to become a nuisance. What is the lesson here? What do we want to do with suicide bombers? Is all life sacred or isn't it? Those are the questions we need to confront.

Permalink",False,"A film spent mostly in rooms with people talking to each other over screens hardly sounds like the most riveting thing, but mostly this film manages to overcome that. We have a sort of moral-maze thriller with a ticking clock scenario of highly desirable terrorist targets in one place while a drone loaded with missiles is above. If this sounds like a fairly easy call to make, then the film continually stumps that decision with some tough moral decisions (which are real on the ground, not theory in the plot), political shoulder-sloping, individual opinion, and individual morals.

In some ways this does work, because it keeps tensions going, and it also encourages the viewer to think about the decisions being made. Truth be told though, I wanted it to be better than it was in that regard. Too much of the drama feels forced or overly engineered, with the stakes always seeming to be raised in one direction or the other. In doing this it also forces interesting points to become polarized to the extremes, and in the end it becomes a bit too simplistic in its delivery – with the concluding scenes and the footage under the end credits showing this very clearly.

The starry cast all do well though, considering that they are mostly debating and talking. The standouts are Rickman's droll delivery in his last on-screen performance, but more importantly is Barkhad Abdi, who is given the only 'action' of the film and is engaging in his heroics. All told though, the film does mostly work in the moments, but it pushes its narrative too far and has too much which seems forced, sentimental, or simplistic (or all three). Makes for a dramatic watch, but not one that lingers in the mind."

Permalink",False,"Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) leads a British operation to capture valuable Al-Shabaab terrorists in Kenya who are British citizens. It's a global effort with a US drone operated out of Vegas and monitored in Pearl Habor. There are local government operatives with state-of-the-art naturalistic drones camouflaged as a humming bird and a beetle. Lieutenant General Frank Benson (Alan Rickman) guides a group of British government leaders. The suspected terrorists leave for a Al-Shabaab controlled slum where the government military is reluctant to deploy. Soon, surveillance finds the group preparing suicide bomb vests and the mission escalates. After much debate, the kill order is given but USAF pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) sees a little girl selling bread.

Director Gavin Hood tackles the complicated morality of the modern war. The politicians debate. Their hand wringing is tough to watch. The legal arguing is frustrating. It depicts the global disconnected nature of today's war as well as the guys on the ground level. Barkhad Abdi does another ethnic Somali character as a Kenyan agent. There are a couple of things I would alter. There is no need to concentrate on the little girl living or dying. Leaving it unknown would have been much more compelling. Also Aaron Paul should not be playing a rookie. It would be more compelling for a veteran to demand additional assessment. It hints for deeper meaning. They're minor alterations that are not absolutes."

Permalink",False,"Eye in the Sky tries to add a moral layer to an immoral practice.

This is a contrived film that applies a caring moral compass to the notion of drone bombing (or any kind of bombing in domestic situations for that matter). Where every care is taken to avoid killing the innocent, whilst balancing this need up against ""the greater good"".

The reality this film tries to establish is marred by both unresolvable practical and moral considerations.This film focuses in minutiae on the life of one individual but ignores the bigger picture. Obvious random factors that simply can not be accounted for when bombing in built, up civilian areas. People randomly moving into and out of a target zone (this is hinted at in the film), people living or working unseen inside structures next to a target zone.

Not to mention the flow on effect from ""collateral damage"". The father or mother walking past a target zone who is debilitated or killed who might be the soul provider for their family. A young pregnant women who looses her unborn child or is killed outright. People who die from suffocation, buried under rubble. Not to mention the psychological effect living under the constant threat of unseen death from above has on a larger population and the economic damage done to a local economy.

Simply put, there's no justification for this. I'll also add, if the West stayed out of these regions to start, with, I believe, its unlikely these scenarios would arise. The concept of politicians being reluctant to employ drones is also, for the most part, something of a myth. Drone strikes have increased in both frequency and number, in recent years. Statistically, the vast majority of those killed, innocent bystanders.

The quality of acting in this film is for the most part excellent. It employs a good cast including wonderful Alan Rickman, an actor I enjoyed watching over the years. May he rest in peace.

A thoughtful, engaging film in some ways, that may be well intentioned but I can not get past the feeling its skewed in its perspective. In my opinion, it takes a somewhat blinkered view, that mostly overlooks the glaringly obvious. A five out of ten from me."

Permalink",False,"The English are running some operation in Kenya to capture some Al-Shabaab members on their most-wanted list. In charge of the operation is some female senior citizen named Powell. She is joined by a guy from Legal and a guy who calculates the risk of collateral damage. Her tired and unenthusiastic boss--Benson--is running the operation by several ministers. Apparently they have no drones so America is providing the drones run from Las Vegas. There are two drone operators, a girl who pilots the drone and a guy who reads checklists and communicates. In Vegas as well is their boss accompanied by some inferior laptop bombardier. In Hawaii is the facility that provides facial recognition and confirmation that the guys there are looking at are actually the one they are looking for.

They are watching a house in Kenya were several bad guys are meeting. The English are looking specifically for an English radicalized couple and an American. On the ground in Kenya are the military ready to engage and a guy, Jama, and a female running decoy camera drones around the house. Adjacent to the compound is the house of some regular Kenyan who fixes bikes and makes hula hoops for his daughter to play with. His wife makes bread that the little girls sells around the corner. The entire neighborhood has been taken over by Al-Shabaab and every one is at risk who doesn't follow their views. The regular Kenyan family is moderate.

So far they've identified all the bad guys except the English female. Then a person shows up but they can't see her face. Jama has to rush to the street, impersonate a street seller, and operate a caterpillar-shaped drone to fly in the house so that the female can be identified. She is indeed the one they are looking for. When the camera flies to other rooms in the house they find explosives, suicide vests, and a camera. The bad guys are planning two suicide bombings. That changes everything for he English. The mission originally was to capture the radicalized English. Now Powell demands the authority to launch a missile on the house. Her Legal disagrees since that was not the original mission, not to mention that they are acting in a foreign friendly country. Benson supports Powell, but the politicians aren't sure so they ask the foreign minister who is at some weapons convention selling for some company. He suggests they contact the American Secretary of State, who in turn is playing ping-pong in China. He doesn't understand why the English are even debating this. Some neocon contacts the English politicians to assure them that killing people, including American citizen is cool.

Little by little everyone warms up to the idea. Until the little Kenyan girl sets up her table to sell bread right in front of the Al-Shabaab compound. That changes everything for the drone pilots who demand a second ID confirmation, mainly to give the girl time, much to the chagrin of Powell. The way she sees it, the bad guys are ready to blow up a bunch of people and there's no time to waste debating.

She forces her statistics guy to forge the numbers so the girl has a 45% of getting killed. That pleases most involved and Powell, who by now is for some reason directly communicating and bossing the drone pilots around, orders the hit. Thanks to Jama, the girl sells all her bread and slowly starts packing up, that's when the missile is fired.

Eye in the Sky is a somewhat exciting movie that dramatizes Utilitarian ethical arguments. Is it OK to sacrifice the lives of a few in range of a drone missile to presumably save the lives of many who would be killed in suicide bombings? The movie centers the issue on the life of the one girl ignoring all the other bystanders. It also adds some more interesting political arguments. If the suicide bombings take place, Al-Shabaab would be solely responsible, but if the missile kills innocents, the English would have to answer. Or in turn, the English could be blamed for doing nothing when they knew that suicide bombings were about to take place.

These are all fascinating ideas but the movie didn't manage to make them as compelling. There's the issue of realism for me. Usually I don't fault movies for being unrealistic, but here it bothered me a bit especially since we are talking about serious current issues and the movie does try to present itself as realistic. To begin with, the whole idea that the English, traumatized by the fact that they're not an empire anymore yet pathetically proud to be America's poodle would suddenly care about poor dark people out of the blue, after their rich history, is laughable. Of course the same could be said about the teary-eyed drone pilots but at least there's some precedent that country 18 year-olds aren't all that thrilled to be stuck in the role of joystick killers. I can't make sense of what is going on with the chain of command here. Then there's the second-rate acting by first-rate actors that also distracted me. As the debate gets more intense, the quality of the acting drops.

Otherwise, the movie looks good like most of the war on terror movies, it's sharp and crisp with rich colors and good contrast and it all takes place during daylight. Music initially is good and adds to the tension although it also sounded familiar, but then it too dropped in quality. Eye in the Sky could have been a fascinating, strong, and controversial movie instead it settled for the melodramatic."

Permalink",False,"This story could not have happened in our world.

The technology doesn't work.

And I'm not talking about hovering drone planes and science fiction bug cameras.

I'm talking about simple physics.

There's no such thing as ""real time"". Light moves fast, sure, but with transmissions between satellites and through processing and routing hardware back and forth, UAV pilots report up to a TWENTY second delay. -According to ""Kill Chain: Drones and the Rise of High-Tech Assassins"" by journalist Andrew Cockburn.

That's the hard reality.

Pull up a clock and watch the second hand move 5 ticks. In a critical situation, (or even mundane; a UAV cannot land on pilot controls because of this; up to 2/3 of drones when they crash, do so on landing), broadcast delay becomes a significant factor in how this technology can be employed, what it is good for, and what it is not.

So that's the whole film rendered fantasy right there. Nearly every major scene in this film required *magic* to exist.

Moreover, this being the case, drones have to be programmed for missions before they engage. Pilots are there for the micro decision making only, and then they are dealing with cloud cover, a not-hovering camera, and low-quality resolutions optimized for speed, which makes positive IDs a game of total guesswork. Described as looking down from 20,000 feet through a drinking straw, ""Is that a dog, child, woman or a soldier?""

It's easy, when you're trigger happy, worn down by military life and heavily propagandized, to be willing to ""confirm"" a grainy blob on a screen for the benefit of the report. But making a film like this something even remotely related to actual events in the real world? No way.

From an interview with a retired UAV pilot:

~~~

Why isn't he with the Air Force anymore? There was one day, he says, when he knew that he wouldn't sign the next contract. It was the day Bryant walked into the cockpit and heard himself saying to his coworkers: ""Hey, what mother___er is going to die today?""

~~~

So with all of that make-believe in place, (and I can't imagine for an instant the creators were truly that ignorant when they made it), it begs the question, ""What was the real intention here?""

Propaganda, of course! Just try getting a big film budget approved when you aren't willing to play ball. So beside all of the make-believe technology, this film was a sickly sweet course of lies about how much the government cares. Bzzt! Sorry. NONE of the decisions are made that way, and nobody in higher offices are cringing or worrying over these kills. That's the pure self-calming wishful thinking of a public trying to reassure itself that its government isn't run by psychopaths.

As with the ridiculously expensive high-tech surveillance package sold to and enshrined with almost religious fervour in the US military during the Viet Nam days, (look that up; it's insane. The U.S. dropped tens of thousands of sensors all over the jungle with the idea that they could remotely track troop movements. How clever! Except that it didn't work. The Viet Cong learned early on that you could take this stupid tech and manipulate the enemy by driving a single truck past a vibration sensor a hundred times to make it look to U.S. brass like a whole convoy was en route to somewhere it wasn't, or by sprinkling urine on other select chemical sensors to create whole ghost battalions. -But nobody was allowed to talk about these shortcomings. It HAD to work; the money was too big and the investment of jobs held too great a momentum to stop that runaway stupid train.)

This whole ""Modern Warfare"" thing with UAVs is just the same. It doesn't work; it can't deliver on its promises but the money train isn't going to stop because winning wars and precision bombing was never the goal, just the ad copy in the DARPA brochure. Keeping a multi-billion dollar river of cash and jobs and egos flowing is the goal, and don't kid yourself about it. -When military brass threaten a shooting coup when some hapless British minister tabled the idea of cutting back on military expenditures, citing job loss as the primary concern, you get a picture of the real forces driving war culture. The victim countries are just a required component.

And propaganda films like this one are also a required component to keep the public happily nodding along to the whole circus.

Sadly, looking at the numbers on this piece of fantasy, it appears to be working."

Permalink",False,"Yet another ""black-ops"" movie in a recognisably topical world trouble-spot, this time Kenya, where religious fundamentalists have as we all know carried out in recent times a series of executions, suicide bombings, kidnappings and more. As ever, both Britain and the U.S. are keen observers of any suspicious situation which might lead to catastrophe with both up-close and remote eyes on developing events in never-ending, undercover surveillance. This film dramatically, probably over- dramatically posits the moral dilemma which political decision-makers have to consider before pushing the engage button, namely how many lives can be discounted as acceptable collateral damage to potentially save many others from almost certain death from a suicide bomb attack.

Played out in what seems like real-time, the tension is ratcheted right up to the dramatic climax as you won't believe how much you'll want a little local girl to sell her wares of half a dozen or so loaves. We see clearly how gung-ho military personnel are keen to go in for the kill even to the point of manipulating subordinate staff to their will, being prepared to lie to ministers to advance their sometimes dubious case and to do so sometimes recklessly, with a disregard for human life and respect for the political process of government. Politicians are shown to be often dithering and conscience-stricken, ultimately in thrall to the power and conviction of the generals, as here.

For me, I found these characterisations to be a little obvious and stereotypical, especially with the military tail here seeming to wag the governmental dog, which I think over-simplified the situation. While it makes for gripping edge-of-the-seat thrills, I felt that using the young girl's unwitting and untimely location to sell her bread to pose the moral dilemma at the heart of the film, a conclusion only confirmed by the introduction of a second child who arrives on the scene near the end.

I found though that there were too many coincidences to swallow in the narrative, none more so than the afore-mentioned children inconsiderately making themselves unintentional human targets. The use of drones, particularly the mechanised flying mosquito operated by a local agent on the spot seemed too far-fetched with hints of ""Mission Impossible"" and the late Alan Rickman's home-based General surely wouldn't have been so uncaringly belligerent as here.

Putting these matters aside, this was still a convincing, broadly credible political thriller. well acted by principals Rickman and Helen Mirren. With camera shots from multiple perspectives and lots of expository dialogue in soldier-speak, it's also a tech-thriller which keeps the tension going right up until the end."

Permalink",True,"Eye in the Sky: a movie with a wondrous mix of on the ground action, and tough moral decision making. As many critics would agree, it is of paramount importance for every movie to follow an intriguing narrative. However, it is pivotal for a movie to contain actors which can make or break tense moments in the story-line and for that reason I am of the candid opinion that Helen Mirren transforms 'Eye in the Sky' from a movie with a detailed narrative to a movie with both a detailed narrative and a well-presented 100 minutes.

To summarise, 'Eye in the Sky' would catch the eye of any action-lover, thriller-devotee, crime-fanatic, military-enthusiast; you understand where this is going! Albeit if it wasn't for the brilliance of Mrs. Mirren, this movie would lose 2 stars of my rating.

Even if it was the only available option (it really shouldn't be), with all the time it took to deliberate. you'd think they could've introduced a drone with a smaller payload, used a biological agent or something else.

Maybe they make it too long with the suspense, I even caught myself talking to the screen that they should damn push the fricking button. But it worked for me, I never got bored watching Eye In The Sky. And even though, like many other humans, I think every war is completely useless and fought by people that will never risk their lives anyways, because the only thing they do is making others doing the dirty job. Eye In The Sky is the perfect example of modern warfare. Colateral damage is just a word to give them a clear conscience. War on terrorism should be fought differently. There are enough examples of known terrorists they watch for years before taking any actions. Those people should be removed out of society way earlier. Before damage is done. Anyways, the movie is pleasant to watch, with good actors, with the right amount of suspense. A good one in this genre.

Possibly one of the first movies to tackle the risks of collateral damage in tough military decisions but missed the target by implying that everyone at a senior level would halt their decisions because a little girl might get injured. The decision on how to proceed was apparent, and morally justified from the start. Perhaps it would have been better to focus the audience on how they set parameters for collateral damage rather than making it a prolonged debate about rescuing a young girl! It would have been good to see a study of the real moral and ethical impact of having to make the decision to 'push the button' on a non military target.

I had expected this to be more of a focus on the drone operations and it isn't. Instead it is more of a psychological thriller. It examines the issues involved in conducting drone operations to take out terrorists half a world away from the drone operators.

The core story here involves a couple of terrorists, one from England and the other from the USA, traveling to and meeting other terrorists in Kenya. A surveillance team made up of politicians and military leaders are following them remotely using surveillance cameras. The mission is to capture them alive and bring them back for due process and trial.

The mission gets knocked off track from two surprises. The first is when a local operative launches a camera in a flying beetle that goes into the house where the terrorists are. They see a cache of ammunition and a suicide bomb-making operation. This means a suicide mission is imminent and killing them with an air strike may be better, to prevent them from killing a mass number of people in a public place.

The second surprise is when a young girl is sent by her family to set up and sell about 8 loaves of bread her mom had just baked. She is right outside the wall of the target building and a blast from a drone missile would likely kill her. Can they live with that type of collateral damage?

So, like in 1957's ""12 Angry Men"" where personal prejudice and personal goals can cloud the decision making process, that is exactly what we have here. The military leaders see an opportunity to take out high value terrorist targets, they want the OK for a precision strike. The political leaders see a public relations pitfalls, while the low-ranking drone operators back in the USA on a military base see the human side of it, the burden of counting down and pressing a trigger that will kill people, maybe even children, half-way around the world.

The movie does not try to give any easy answers, it shows how difficult it can be to do the right thing for the greater good of all.

SPOILERS: In the end politicians are convinced that the strike should be made, it is, drone cameras show one high-value target is still alive, a second strike is ordered to get her. In the process the young girl was not gone in time, she is badly injured. Her parents take her to a clinic for medical care but she cannot be saved. The two drone operators back on base are told to go home and get some rest, ""We need you back here in 12 hours.""

Permalink",False,"...The meaning of the title. During the prolonged moral debates, can anyone claim the God perspective?

Near the end, the sun's brilliance is again prominent. Perhaps suggesting those underneath feel the glare of that same eye.

The opening scene is of bread, nourishment, being drawn out of a fire. Near the end, another character is picking up something for his child too. Nice framing.

Overall, the repetitious interruptions of dialogue over action gets tiresome, but of course this is the point of the story. I suggest not watching this as a thriller - though it is thrilling - but as comment on morality and trauma in war. No level of technology will bring us above it.

Permalink",True,"Set in an alternative universe where the Americans care about civilian casualties and Dame Helen Mirren has given up her acting career to join the army, this taut political thriller stars Alan H. Rickman as the steely-eyed Lieutenant General Severus Benson-Snope.

The British government has finally located a notorious terrorist cell in Somalia, and the Americans have lent them a drone to obliterate the house where the terrorists are staying. But just as Helen Mirren is about to call down the righteous vengeance of ten thousand thousand Anglo Saxon generations, the Americans get cold feet. Their reason? A black girl (in Somalia, of all places!) is too close to the target, and could be badly bruised by a Hellfire missile.

Colonel Mirren and Lieutenant General Benson-Snope do their best to persuade the Americans and their own government that the attack must proceed, but in a world where nobody wants to take responsibility for what must be done, their pleas fall on deaf ears.

A cat and mouse game of pressure politics ensues, as Mirren and Benson- Snope turn the screws on their limp-wristed allies. Can they hit their target and kill the irritating girl at the same time, or will they be forced to abort the mission entirely? There can be only one answer!

I rate Eye in the Sky at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a glorious 8/10 on IMDb.

While trying to get political getting permission a 9 year old girl turns up to sell bread right outside the building which they plan to blow up. To say this film is dumb is an understatement. It's full of characters who look like they haven't been in their job for more than five minutes despite supposedly being experts in their fields. Helen Mirren doesn't look like a Colonel , Aaron Paul is no drone pilot and Monica Dolan is doing her W1A character. You also have to wonder if the drone technology is anything like we see in this film. Despite cameras being twenty thousand feet above or inside a mechanical bug ( no i'm not joking) the pictures are in perfect HD quality. It's not a terrible film. In fact it is quite watchable but you have to take your brain out before watching otherwise you will find yourself picking holes in it constantly. If you really want to see a film about drone attacks , Good Kill starring Ethan Hawke is the much better film.

Permalink",False,"Eye in the sky is not a war film. The scenes that take place have a military context, but this movie is not about terrorism, catching the bad guy, or even preventing further acts of violence from men and women who hate the western world. This film is about the consequences of our actions as a nation, and our willingness to let good people die in the name of freedom and security.

What this film brings to the viewer is a rather realistic view of the quagmire of legal and moral responsibilities shared by various government and military bodies. There are so many moments in this film, that make the viewer question what is right and what is wrong. Many of the decisions of military action is done by people in offices, crewmen stationed halfway around the world, and politicians with their own agendas. Here we witness the intricacies of this process and the impact these groups of people have on the third world, where most of the foreign enemy lives. But so do a many people and families, whom lives are forever altered by the actions of just a few men and women in who consider it their job to protect the people and interests of their own nations.

Helen Mirren portrays Colonel Katherine Powell of U.K. Special Forces. Her mission is to discover the location, and carry out the possible termination of 3 terrorists at the top of various global watch lists, currently spotted in Kenya. To do so, she will be leading a joint operation between several offices. A team of U.S air-force drone pilots providing over-watch (Phoebe Fox and Aaron Paul), Kenyan Special Forces on the ground (Barkhad Abdi), while relaying details to U.K Head of Command based in London (with Alan Rickman). It's a well blended cast, and each person brings something unique to the table. I personally enjoyed seeing Mirren's determination in her role, one originally meant for a male lead, but her cocksure attitude and resolve to complete her mission resounds in her performance. Barkhad Abdi was a very nice addition, he shows a lot of heart in his actions, and as a Somali national he uses his language skills to bring authenticity to the screen. Alan Rickman, of course, should be mentioned not because of his untimely passing, but because of the broad spectrum he brings to the screen. His voice resounds authority in his role, and in his final scene he delivers a fantastic line about the lives of soldiers I don't think anyone should miss.

For those of us who have served in the military, have family members who do, or support our seemingly endless and idyllic war on terrorism abroad, I recommend you watch this moral tale. Director Gavin Hood designed it to make you think about the consequences of our actions abroad, and the absurd hypocrisy of ending innocent lives abroad in our pursuit of freedom and security at home.

Permalink",False,"With its drawn out debates on the speculated possibilities and moral dilemma, it is more like a '12 Angry Men' of the current times having similar stakes but added urgency. A thrilling combination of drama, suspense and action genres coupled with slick graphics and the right talent pooled in from old and new generations alike.

Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) is overseeing an operation to follow and capture a possible terrorist in Kenya with the help of an unmanned drone being flown by a rookie Pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul). Once they identify the terrorists and learn their motives of an immediate suicide bombing, the capture mission converts to kill. When a little girl enters the kill zone, the mission objective gets blown into an international debate on moral and social implications.

The hero of the movie is its terrific screenplay that is interesting, quick paced and best of all - even. The writing brings about all possible debates like doing anything for the greater good, value of human life, accountability of decision makers and implementors etc., and also beautifully portrayed by a talented ensemble cast led by veteran actors Helen Mirren, Alan Rickman (his last movie) and well supported by budding actors like Aaron Paul and Barkhad Abdi.

It starts off in a slightly disconnected manner and one might hastily assume that they are about to see something similar to Ethan Hawke starrer 'Good Kill', but it quickly raises the stakes both in action and drama before plunging into an excellent debate driven by reason, objective and moral consciousness. The urgency to make a decision from the hesitant decision makers adds to the suspense. Background score is apt, cinematography is eye pleasing and editing is top notch.

Timely moral debate with breakneck pacing, slick editing and terrific acting makes it a must watch.

PS: While it is good to see such military officers and bureaucrats thinking ethically and morally focused on a common objective, it is highly unrealistic considering the real life statistics of collateral damage making it a dubious propaganda piece."

Permalink",False,"This was the thinker's movie about war and the costs - in human lives - on both the virtual side ( ""eye in the sky""), and those on the ground. What I liked about this film is that there are no easy answers to the questions it raises but does not answer. A stellar cast, tight script and solid directing makes this a thriller worth watching. It's not an easy task to create a successful film that deals with all of these complex issues and leaves on the edge of their seat. What are the moral implications of war, including the killing of innocents to prevent the deaths of more innocent lives, as well as the political, government, military and ethical imperatives that complicate the chain of command in split-second situations? This film does an excellent job of exploring these issues within the context of drone warfare. Two thumbs up. Leave it up to the Brits to make an intelligent and timely film about this controversial topic. Alan Rickman does indeed have the best line in the film, a fitting tribute to such a wonderfully talented actor who passed too soon.

Permalink",False,"Eye in the Sky is a nail biting thriller...One of the best films i have watched in recent times. Very intriguing plot where-in a colonel (played excellently by actress Hellen Mirren) has to strike a missle in a house which has 3 most wanted ppl on their hitlist and are from a terror group called Al Shabaab . Also she has to ensure the impact of the strike is minimal as there are other civilians around the place...... Lot of political implications and difficulties arise when she has to negotiate with seniors and the other bureaucrats as they hesitate to give her clearance for the mission. The script, photography, editing and the direction is just top class and the film manages to keep u edge of the seat till the end. Few films manage to achieve this feat...i can only remember the last film which managed to do this- Captain Phillips. Performances are also excellent in the film. Hellen Mirren who plays a senior Colonel is brilliant. She suits the role completely. There is also Aaron Paul from Breaking Bad fame and he is superb. There is also Barkhad Abdi (the pirate leader from Captain Phillips). he plays his part well....Lastly Alan Rickman as the Lt. General was fantastic. The dialgoue which he says in the end will make you break into an applause. Eye in the Sky is one of the best thrillers. Its tense, gripping and shocking. Superb Stuff. If you love movies...Don't miss this at any cost."

I must say that this is the most brilliant movie I have even seen after a long time. Usually today's thriller and action movies are so predictable but this one is really based on how things exactly happen based on the observations and executions done politically, legally and ""militarily"". My eyes were just set on the movie and nothing else as this movie is excellent.

Every actor in this movie have done an exemplary performance. Very well planned and executed movie especially the end scene where the parents begging the army guys to save their daughter was such a heart breaking scene where I believe anyone watching it will be moved to tears. Such movies should not only get nominated but also win each and every award especially in the direction and picture category. Great job to the director Mr. Gavin Hood. Keep up the good work sir.....

Permalink",False,"A new kind of war. When everyone is worried about robots might take over our jobs, it meant military as well. There was not robots in this, but a war fought from a safe distance and soldiers don't have to be physically trained so well, even the geeks with the gaming knowledge can take over. So a film about the modern warfare where the casualty rate is very minimum and can be accomplished before any major assault take place.

From the South African director of 'Ender's Game' fame. This is slightly a similar theme, but a real world affair and a real time presentation. Initially I thought it was a remake of the Hong Kong film of the same name. We had seen drone attacks in the films, but they won't last for a few minutes. This film was entirely about how drone missions work that told with detail.

""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war.""

This was a very good film and they must make a sequel to it. This film will get a special status going towards the future. There were no physically exceptional performances, the stars' presence and their verbal expressions were stronger. So there many thrilling scenes with great lines, especially Alan Rickman's final dialogue. This film was his final film and he was excellent like the usual. Even the Abdi's role was small, but powerful and so Helen Mirren's, but Aaron Paul and the rest were decent.

The story was good, but I did not like the too much sentimentalised. Because all's fair in love and war. You won't make a film to please the terrorists and their sympathisers. Other than that it is a masterpiece. Surely worth a watch.

You are starting a war which will never going to end and your children will going to pay a heavy price for which you have started and brought to our children and youth, do you think the father who's daughter died in the film in reality will forgive anyone who involved in it, he will be a upcoming suicide bomber hopefully as can't expect him to forgive you as he has only one thing to live for which is her daughter to raise her and look after her through his small business of bicycle and in a way its a true story that you do kill innocent people like these in these drone attacks who have small things really to live for and you even take that from them as well, and once he also became a suicide bomber so obvious threat for you and then you will going to plan another drone attack and will going to kill 100's or 1000's around him and preparing few more bombers yourself from everyone attack, because if you kill someone family how you think you will get away, obviously one day you will be accountable for sure, it just matter of time so wait for your turn or there is only solution stop selling arms as that is the only earning way for the USA and supplying them to Daesh, Taliban etc and other countries and stop these drones you will going to see peace otherwise u will pay like we are paying now.

Permalink",False,"This movie got a hold of a strong moral dilemma. Ethics play a key role on the plot, and throughout the movie one can identify with the different points of view presented, and with the position of the different decision makers - I rather identified with the position of the non-decision makers. The legal and political web entwined in warfare nowadays gives us at the same time a certain level of comfort - knowing that a single crazy commander can't have free access to mass destruction weapons - and at the same time it must play a core role when the time to act is due. Nobody wants to make this kind of choices, and bear the consequences. That being said, the casting was done a little bit on the safe side - but the safe side is a good side. The actors are great and they are perfectly fitted for the roles. The cinematography is also meritorious. Overall, a very entertaining and praiseworthy movie, with some food for thought.

Permalink",False,"'EYE IN THE SKY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

A military drama/thriller flick, about a compromised drone strike operation; due to the possible collateral damage of a young girl. The film was directed by Gavin Hood (who's previously helmed movies like 'X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE', 'ENDER'S GAME' and 'RENDITION') and it was written by Guy Hibbert (I'm not really familiar with his resume at all). The movie stars Helen Mirren, Aaron Paul, Barkhad Abdi and Alan Rickman (in one of his final film roles). It was a decent hit at the Box Office, and it got almost unanimously positive reviews from critics (as well). I loved it too.

The film tells the story of a military operation, designed to capture terrorists in Kenya; by using top secret drone surveillance. When the officer in charge, Colonel Katherine Powell (Mirren), learns that that the terrorists are plotting a suicide bombing, she changes the mission's objective from capture to kill. This causes some moral dilemmas, for everyone involved; especially when a 9- year-old girl enters the drone strike area. The entire operation is put at risk, while Powell struggles to get clearance to go through with the attack.

The movie is intense, thought provoking, and entirely emotionally involving. The cast is all top-notch as well; especially Paul and the late Alan Rickman. It's also nice to see Mirren doing what she does best again, as another strong female lead too; in a military thriller flick (like this) as well. Hood's direction has never been better, and the script is brilliant. What I like most about the film though, is that it's completely relatable (and believable); there are no bad guys (or good ones), just people doing their jobs (all with completely rational, and mostly compassionate, ideas and opinions). It's one of the best movies so far this year!

Permalink",True,"In what turns out to be one of the best movies of the year, we are treated to a controversial piece where the welfare of the many might not outweigh the good of one. This point might become debatable for the members of the audience as the plot develop, and you will see what the dilemma is. The point is mute, and the resolution a bit predictable, but it's the way the game is played that makes this film a very engrossing one.

Regardless of the opinion of many other people who believe the emphasis is on propaganda, I think there's the issue of showing you a situation, its possible consequences, and the presentation of various points of view. It is not a perfect film because a couple of the characters are underdeveloped, but Helen Mirren, as grand as ever and Alan Rickman can show many how to convey emotions with the right expression or the proper intonation.

Mirren plays a General who is coordinating the possible capture of some of the most wanted criminals on the planet. She's presented a perfect opportunity to come in and capture them. As the story unfolds, the main objective changes to their elimination, but matters of diplomacy and morality get on the way. Soon debates begin, responsibilities are deferred, and the clock ticks, as the decision taken might result in a large number of casualties.

The film is edited with a sure hand that balances suspense and keeps the interest and the action going at a good pace. There's no slow moment because dialog is kept short and to the point, and we are always are of what's going on. We want to jump in the action and turn the key so to speak.

This is a film that makes you think of what is going in today's world. What we see might not be exactly what happens and how it happens, but it's one of those themes that will make you wonder why things happen the way they happen.

Permalink",False,"War on film seldom speaks the truth they say, the ones that have actually been in one. So how then is war, and how is it conducted? Only those who've ever been in one can tell and the rest of us are left to guess and speculate. Perhaps for the best. Eye in the Sky is a film about a different kind of war, a more modern and difficult to judge. In Kenya two British and one American citizen have been tracked, all converted to acts of terrorism. British, American and Kenyan intelligence services are working close together. But when the time has come to strike, everything is not as simple as they thought. Alan Rickman here does his last live-action film with others including Helen Mirren and Aaron Paul.

I really liked Eye in the Sky. Actually in the same way I liked the Danish film A War. It offers a different angle on war. Not the heroic one where everything is black and white, there is a good and a bad side. Here they go deeper and enter the fields of laws, how we got the right on our side to do this and will it create legal and political consequences? Eye in the Sky focus on the games behind the war. Who makes the decisions and how is the relationship between different countries. Very interesting and thoughtful.

Eye in the Sky works very much with editing between the different locations, USA, UK and Kenya. Excitement is not built from action but created from drama and editing. I like that. It means that there is a thought behind ever sequence. Everything from the trivial choice Alan Rickman's general character has to make about which doll to buy for his grandchild, to Aaron Paul's character's more serious scene where he demands another control on collateral damage for the mission. This film like so many others can of course not give us straight view on what it is to be in a war, but I still like this kind of film because it doesn't exactly show us how it is. It lets us figure it out for ourselves and form or own opinions. Who had the right on their side in the end? I think it is up to each and every one of us to decide. Rickman exits with a great film and is truly one of the strongest characters. A tight and very exciting war thriller.

Permalink",False,"As technology advances, war doesn't. There is nothing heroic about war though heroic actions take place every minute in the form of soldiers and leaders who must make both long range and split second decisions which never are wholly correct because war is death vs. life, the saving of some lives by destroying others, and such decisions are ones that a world without war would not face. Every war (or now as we are all too aware 'simultaneous wars') introduces new weapons – either more power (as in the atomic bomb, etc) or more sophisticated spying. This film is about the endless war on terrorism and the use of drone cameras (carried in drone planes, drone beetles, drone humming birds) that aid in directing destruction into more specific areas rather than simply bombing an entire city or village or country.

Gavin Hood directs (and plays a significant acting role) this screenplay by Guy Hibbert, very correctly titled EYE IN THE SKY – a film that reveals all the permutations of drone spying and targeting enemies. The story Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren), a UK- based military officer in command of a top secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya. Through remote surveillance and on-the-ground Intel, Powell discovers the targets are planning a suicide bombing and the mission escalates from ""capture"" to ""kill."" But as American pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) is about to engage, a nine-year old girl enters the kill zone triggering an international dispute, reaching the highest levels of US and British government, over the moral, political, and personal implications of modern warfare. The majority of the film – as we watch a group of terrorist ready themselves for a suicide attack – takes place in the offices of the British and American decision makers who simply cannot resolve the question of strike with a known casualty result in the periphery of the staging facility we have been observing. The key figure in the struggle as to whether or not to carry out orders to missile bomb the compound is the very green new soldier (Aaron Paul) who simply cannot agree to carry out orders when those orders would mean the death of a young girl selling bread near the target.

The struggle for power in decision making includes Alan Rickman (his farewell performance as he died in January 2016), Richard McCabe, Jeremy Northam, Monica Dolan, Michael O'Keefe, Laila Robins, James Alexander, Kim Engelbrecht among others. There is a brilliant cameo by Barkhad Abdi as the Kenyan attaché who spies with his own set of drones (beetle, hummingbird, etc) and cares for the little bread-selling girl. A brilliant movie about a horrifying situation – one that seems we will continue to hear about as this terrorist threat grows. Grady Harp, July 16"

The movie is very deep, well shot and thought-provoking and yet incredibly simple: The Good Guy Countries have to make a decision on the possibly of killing an innocent child to take out terrorists that have the potential of killing 80 or more innocent humans. That's really it.

Now, I'm not downplaying the movie at all. I truly enjoyed how it was filmed, acted and the idea of how to handle this scenario. ""What would you do?"" is the fundamental question here. You don't have a 100% chance the child will die with an airstrike on the terrorist, but you also don't have a 100% chance the terrorist will succeed in killing dozens upon dozens more. If you don't act, you do have 100% chance that child will live but now a higher probability those terrorists will succeed and kill more innocent families and ruining countless other lives.

Like I said, I have a strong opinion on this, and not to get political or harsh, the decision has to be made to

***

Final thoughts: Haha. Yeah, I agree with Spock I and II on this one. I do believe the majority wins. But, see this movie and make up your own mind. If you haven't already.

Permalink",True,"This story at times appears so complex that it helps to set out up front the simple basic situation, stripped to the bare essentials. In a small house in Nairobi, two terrorists are strapping bombs onto their bodies. A reasonable assumption is that once they leave the house, they will head for a public place to finish their suicide mission that will result in massive casualties. The house, together with the sinister occupants, can be demolished by a missile launched from a drone attack, quite common in today's warfare. This seems the best solution as the risk of causing any collateral damage is calculated to be minimal.until a young girl is spotted setting up a stall, too close to the house, to sell bread. The dilemma is only too painfully obvious. If you strike, this innocent, likable girl would most likely become collateral damage. If you don't, what is at stake is much higher, but with less certainty.

Now let us, step by step, add the complexity. The ""sinister occupants"" referred to above comprise not only the suicide bombers who are just pawns, but also three terrorists on the most-wanted list for East Africa, numbers 2, 4 and 5 respectively. Killing them will save many lives. But the operation has been launched as one for ""capturing"", not ""killing"". Adding to the complication is that these three are either British or American citizens.

Who are the people behind this? Too many. At the operational command level stationed in Sussex is Col. Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren), supported by a team of advisers on military intelligence, casualty assessment, legal considerations and so on. Lt. Gen. Frank Benson (Alan Rickman), her immediate superior and the one to give the go-ahead, is in conference in Whitehall with a gathering of British high officials. To press the trigger to execute the actual strike from a military base in Las Vegas is Steve Watts (Aaron Paul), the drone ""pilot"" (not actually sitting in the drone plane) who has only been involved in reconnaissance and never participated in any attack. Providing more technical support is a group based on a warship in Hawaii. Finally, right on site in Nairobi is a local undercover agent (Barkhad Abdi, who was never in front of a movie camera before when he acted opposite Tom Hanks in ""Captain Phillips""), looking like a native African villager but in actual fact a technical expert operating mechanical surveillance devices with amazing deft (things that look like metal birds and beetles). All these people, literally all around the globe, are staring at the same satellite screens that show in minute details the house, both outside and inside (thanks to the beetle). Facial details are of such high quality that they allow the application of highly sophisticated recognition tools to instantly confirm that these are indeed numbers 2, 4 and 5.

Having fun yet? The fun hasn't even started. Confirmation of the identities of the terrorists clears the first obstacle but this is still a ""capture"" mission. Discovery of the suicide bombers is overwhelmingly persuasive to turn this into a ""kill"" mission. Col. Powell is delighted that the terrorists that she has been tracking for six years become welcome ""bonuses"". The legality of the ""kill"" operation is cleared efficiently and categorically. But there are always people with saintly morality values and standards. When questions are raised by such a one, Gen. Benson's weight cannot carry the day. Ducking, the minister who is supposed to make the decision seek refuse in the divinely wonderful cure-all: ""refer up"".

At this point, I cannot resist quoting a critic's witty comment, that a good alternate title of this movie can be ""Passing the buck"". And I may perhaps add that at this juncture I for one have an eerie feeling that I am watching Monty Python. Two people close to the top in their respective countries are inconveniently on foreign diplomatic missions. When located in Singapore, British foreign secretary has just fled the publicity function to his hotel room to entertain diarrhea. His physical predicament however does not prevent him from quickly pointing out that of the three terrorists, two are Americans. When tracked down in Beijing playing ping-pong, the American secretary of state efficiently saves the day, responding without batting an eyelash that the terrorists, by being such, are no longer considered American citizens. The expression on his face clearly says ""How can these Brit idiots have such simple matters interrupt my ping-pong!""

When it looks like the coast is finally cleared and drone pilot Watts is about to press the button to launch the missile to send the terrorists to oblivion, he spots the aforementioned bread-vending girl setting up her stall at a spot where she has a 65% chance of being killed. The final coup that Col. Powell has to resort to is to persuade the technician to revise the estimate to 45%. To a professional accountant, this is all too familiar: cooking the books.

The revised, ""kill"" operation is executed. The three terrorist were killed. So was the innocent, extremely likable girl.

Apologies if I made this sound farcical. A critic has actually used the word ""farce"" to describe the movie. Let me make amends by saying that the tragic gravity finally sinks in when you see the blood-drained body of the girl carried to the hospital with the anxiety-stricken father and wailing mother by her side.

While ""thriller"" and ""drama"" are generally used to categorize this movie, it can arguably be considered a procedural, as in police procedural. We know next to nothing about the personal background of the characters. They are soldiers, diplomat, technicians, secret agents, terrorists and civilians unaware of their danger of becoming in an instant collateral damage.

The acting is top-notch and Rickman will be remembered in his farewell piece of work.

Permalink",False,"I am disgusted by this film. It is an appalling apology for the use of drone strikes. It uses an entirely contrived scenario of UK involvement in a drone strike in Kenya to stop a ""ticking bomb"" of a suicide bomber assumed to be setting out to kill scores of innocents at a shopping mall. The whole process is feminized, with women's feelings for a potential little girl's death as collateral damage affecting the mission and giving the impression their is healthy moral oversight. The film seems to be saying it's a hard choice to conduct targetted assassinations like this, but it's worth it for the greater good of saving more lives. It only gets the one point instead of zero from me because it mocks the callous disregard of the onlooking US personnel having no qualms about letting the drones rip with their deathly destruction. Still I would have liked some suggestion that US drone strikes have killed far more innocent civilians than targets, thus serving as a recruiting seargent for extremists, and that they almost always violate international law and the sovereignty of other nations.

Permalink",True,"Led by Helen Mirren and a superb cast, ""Eye in the Sky"" is a taut suspense drama focusing on the behind-the-scenes decision-making process of making joint U.S.-British drone strike on terrorists in Kenya.

The film is successful in developing a set of characters who possess a conscience about collateral damage. The focal point is a child selling loaves of bread near the bomb site. Will the drone strike be authorized? Or will the issues be carefully weighed to assess the odds of the child dying in the bombing? The bureaucratic wrangling is at the heart of some of the finest scenes in the film, as the legal experts, politicians, and military debate the protocol in launching the strike.

There is a key line at the end of this film, as spoken by the late actor Alan Rickman about ""the cost of war."" But the film is really about the ethics of the contemporary war on terror. ""Eye in the Sky"" is a thoughtful reflection on this important moral issue.

For film-goers who appreciated this film, there is a similar and equally well-made film starring Ethan Hawke, entitled ""Good Kill."" Both dramas touch on important issues of ""the cost of war"" in the twenty-first century.

The movie tried to make the viewer emote unnecessarily. For no good reasons. Weigh the life/death conundrum? Wonder if saving lives is worth taking lives?

The best scenery and action was on the ground on the scene. The people living life and the bad guys guarding the house were the entertainment (let's not forget, it is entertainment we are after).

This movie is about ten years too late with it's moral questions. The thresholds struggled with have long been crossed.

I was hoping to see more of the drone spy tech, as the movie trailers alluded to. But all we got was a snapshot of the drone program from ten years ago.

I doubt such worries, as presented in the movie, exist now. Still a decent distraction...

Permalink",False,"The acting was top notch, the directing was good and the general feel of the film was of good quality. All that remains is to critique how accurate it was, and that is impossible unless you are a drone pilot (and not even then, since they don't allow comments).

The plot is simple: high value targets are all holed up in a house in a suburb controlled by terrorists. What started as a capture mission turns into a drone strike, only there is a tiny little African girl selling bread right next to the house. The movie is all about the military, political and ethical back and forth to authorize the strike or not. Powerful idea, but polluted by the Western cult for young children.

Bottom line: felt overdramatized for a decision that was absolutely inevitable. They tried to pit a very juicy strategic payoff against something as banal as the death of a single individual, be it a child, but in the same time give all the people involved the benefit of the doubt that they did everything possible to save her. For that it felt a bit unreal.

Oh, and by the way, it has nothing to do with Snowden or Manning. Just some teary eyed drone pilots."

Permalink",False,"A well-paced and ably-directed timely film that explores the legal, political and ethical dilemmas surrounding the almost impossible but necessary military decision-making process of drone use against terrorists, and the innocent civilians whose lives are affected by it. The best thing about the film, when it comes to wartime political thrillers like this, is that it isn't preachy and shows the sequence of events in way that doesn't dictate what's to be thought or felt. It raises a lot of important questions and lets our mind do the pondering. Certainly Director Gavin Hood's best work yet; combines the humanism of 'Tsotsi' and political intrigue of 'Rendition', and uses his experience and prowess on a well-written story to give us 'Eye in the Sky' (which is a brilliant name, by the way).

The hilarious but important political bureaucracy and the focus on the life of one young civilian sometimes seem to be milked too much, but those aspects certainly help us see the entire situation in a broader light. The film doesn't focus on numbers; it focuses on the responsibility and accountability of casualties each individual (in the decision-making process) is willing to take when two unpleasant outcomes are presented before them. And as Stephen Holden from 'The New York Times' points out, it's ""unpredictable human behavior (that) repeatedly threatens an operation of astounding technological sophistication.""

The detailed art design, the voyeuristic camera angles and shots, the thumping background score and well-timed silences, and crisp editing - all of these aspects play a big role in creating the feel of the film and pull us into its high-stakes environment. Since most of the film involves communication among people from different agencies, it wouldn't have been effective without the impeccable cast that it has, especially Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman, in his final live-action role; he certainly does get a memorable ending line, ""Never tell a soldier that he doesn't know the cost of war."""

Permalink",False,"I really wanted to see this movie after all the accolades it was given by critics. Just goes to show what a bunch of dimwits they can be when confronted by a cast of good actors saddled with a naff script. A quality production of a totally unconvincing story with a dodgy premise. When a handful of Islamic terrorists, including a radicalized British woman, gather together in a house in a village in Kenya, both British and American military are prepared to take them captive but change their plan to a kill mission on observing two of them being fitted with suicide vests. The pilot of a drone to be used to take them out decides to abort the mission when a small girl is seen selling bread outside the house. Instead of somebody shooting this moron through the head and following through with the mission an interminable series of dumb as a brick arguments takes place between the military brass and their respective British and American governments as to whether the killing of a small girl (selling endless loaves of bread that are replaced as soon as they disappear) is justified when eighty or more civilians might be killed by the suicide bombers. A couple of nifty twists fails to justify what comes across as a totally unconvincing story based on a low ranking pilot's refusal to obey orders. When this halfwit is applauded for his actions at the end of the movie it comes across as merely laughable -- at the very least he should either have been court-martialled for disobeying orders or (preferably) be put up against a wall and shot. And what kind of soldier lapses into tears when finally following through with an order? What a bunch of hand-wringing wimps inhabit this sorry story. The sledgehammer message (is one innocent death justified to save eighty) comes across as absurd in this day and age of widespread terrorism in the world. Good actors can't save this godawful tale. And what a shame that this should be the wonderful Alan Rickman's last. What a huge disappointment."

Permalink",False,"I think the title says it all. Rickman and Mirren never disappoint when you see them and do well for their respective roles (love the zinger Rickman throws at someone near the ending) but like the top reviewer said, the idea that much agonized thought goes into the process by which drone strikes are carried out is such rubbish and unbelievable that the rest of the movie is just a drawn out agonizing exercise in the absurd. Which kind of makes the performance by Aaron Paul as the drone pilot and person who physically has to pull the trigger on a drone strike with civilian casualty consequences (sorry) a waste. Those of you who want to believe, then enjoy the movie and have a good cry. Somewhere there's a drone pilot who just released his payload and is now munching on a bagel.

Permalink",False,"I would recommend ignoring the stage settings of this film, this is neither about war not propaganda....

From my point of view the director portrayed, successfully, a situation in which choices must be made an decisions must be adhered to, regardless of the choice. The director was clever enough to include characters who could play on the same level and other from above and below.. Each adhered to the rules but pushed them to the limit of their capacities.

This was not about rivalry but moreover about the capacity of personal success based upon ones own morals...

It's like the game of chess played by many in the corporate world, beyond power and greed therein lies moral... For some moral is a far greater achievement... But at the end of the day, regardless of moral, decisions must be made and Helen Mirren played out her character marvellously.

I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to anyone who can see beyond the stage settings.."

who gets the best image in this movie the alliance or the terrorists ? they are killed only after 2 missiles, a little kind girl is kill and the terrorist give away their weapons on the jeep to bring this girl in hospital.

Would your answer change it the terrorists would have escaped and killed 80 persons in making them self explode in a moll?
