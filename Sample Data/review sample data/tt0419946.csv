Permalink",False,"I saw this movie on TV and it left me in a state of confusion. I simply could not understand why the people making this movie, made so many misstakes. And what was up with those opening scenes? I got Rambo flashbacks during that. I consider myself to be within the target audience, boys who like action movies with guns, babes, car chases, fights and so on. The problem with this movie IMO is that it underestimates its audience. Just because we like action movies, does not mean we like movies with just action scenes. Nor does it mean that you do not have to make any sense.

10 years ago i would have thought that this movie was tha bombe. I would have thought that it was cool. However this is not 1999, it's 2009 (yes, i know the movie is from 2006). After all the things that have happened in the last couple of years, you simply can not show such unbelievable stuff as getting shot at a 120 times from 3-10 meters away during a car chase and not get hit once (outside the Matrix of course).

This movie made me doubt myself. Have i learned so much about combat tactics, guns and ammo, warfare, law enforcement, crime and human frailty (from watching Discovery Channel and National Geographic) that i am simply incapable of enjoying a simple action movie? After thinking a lot about that i concluded that the answer is yes. Yes, i know to much to enjoy a simple action movie. And The Marine is about as simple as it gets. A bit more work on the script to make it more logical and coherent and this movie would have scored at least 1 more point (probably 2). I know the marines are tough guys, but i also know marines are not dumb. Stubborn yes, but not dumb. The marine in The Marine is tough and dumb.

The Marine is fun to watch, but only when you have nothing else to do. If you need to kill some time, then The Marine will kill it. And you will watch it all the way to the end because of Kelly Carlson. If you are a man you want her to be your lover or hostage. If you are a strait woman or gay man, Kelly Carlson's hair will make you go ""oh wow, look at that, that is hot"". But remember, if you want to enjoy it for more than Kelly Carlson, dumb yourself down a bit.

I gave this movie 5 stars. 1 for Kelly Carlson and her hair, 1 for Robert Patrick and his lines, 1 for the guns, fights and explosions, 1 for the cat-fight and 1 for giving me hope that one day someone will give me a multimillion dollar budget to make my own action movie."

Permalink",True,"About 2 decades ago, people witnessed the age of when the action genre in films was at its finest. The world was given some of the greatest action entertainments ever (Terminator's 1 and 2, Die Hard, Predator, Robocop etc). And all of that was shamefully thrown away for the cheap rip-off's just so Hollywood can make a profit. And here we get WWE starting to finance and distribute films in hopes of expanding their fanbase and their publicity. And they start by throwing their superstar John Cena in his horrendous, over-the-top debut.

""The Marine"" follows John Triton (Cena) who has been recently discharged for disobeying direct orders and he now has a lousy security job (but at the end, the problem of having a job he hates isn't even resolved, but what do we care?). Later on, a group of diamond thieves who are trying to evade the authorities after their latest heist kidnap Triton's wife. Triton decides to do the usual in a dumb action flick; he decides to go after them and take the law into his own hands. But the plot itself is too weak for us to care about what's going on. I mean the problem basically occurred by chance and coincidence when Triton and his wife just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time at the gas station. And all the plot elements don't mesh together very well.

And of course its action because the WWE wrestlers just want to prove their masculinity. And overall, the action sucks. There's explosions and gunfire, lots and lots of explosions and gunfire. But the special effects team must've been on crack because the blasts look like splashes of Sunny Delight, and the gunfire looks like it was made from a home computer with just that stupid orange X and the annoying sparkles that we see.

And the acting performance by Cena is atrocious and more wooden than a redwood forest. Robert Patrick as Rome is sub-par since he wasn't as threatening as he used to be in Terminator 2 and even in Die Hard 2 which he appeared in only 2 scenes. He's pretty much just spewing out dumb one-liners and acting goofy. All that, rather than the intimidating silence he's known for.

And the rest is just a bunch of badly timed jokes, dialogue and scenarios. Especially the part when Morgan is telling about his experiences with his camp counselor and Rome ordering him to find the generator. That part was WAY outta place, badly acted and awkward and it felt like it was never gonna end. And towards the end when Triton surely kills Rome in the blast, then after reviving his wife, Rome suddenly rises again with severe burns and then Triton kills him for good, VERY VERY B movie, if you ask me. And the ""The Marine"" is chock full of moments like those.

I didn't give this the lowest score because some of the fist fights here were alright and I liked some of the pop-culture references such as the ones to Terminator and Scarface here.

But don't waste your time, this is for John Cena die-hards only......

Permalink",False,"I am a huge John Cena fan, so I'm not writing this just to pick on him. But ""The Marine"" is the worst film I've ever seen, and I've made a habit of seeing bad films.

*May contain SPOILERS* The short version: See John shoot. Shoot, shoot, shoot. See John run. BOOM! Run, John, run. See John drive. See John swim. Swim, swim, Boom! Run, swim, hit, BOOM, hit, hit, kiss - The end.

The long version: I'll skip the cheesy opening credits and the bizarre soundtrack (which at more than one point seems to be channeling Celine Dion). The movie was supposedly directed by one John Bonito; I wouldn't say that the movie was directed so much as it wandered along aimlessly, occasionally bumping into scenery. Even the scenery refused to ""act"" (Queensland, Australia is NOT South Carolina, Mr. Bonito). Mr. Cena ambles along through the famous jungles of ""South Carolina,"" occasionally stopping to glance around, never conveying the slightest hint that he might actually be thinking something. Five minutes into the movie, I apologized to the friend I dragged along with me to see it. Ten minutes into it, I officially began imagining a completely different movie. By the end, I no longer cared who lived. I wouldn't have minded if the characters had simply begun shooting themselves, just so that we'd all be put out of our misery.

I wanted this to be a fun movie - I like a fun, cheesy action film as much as the next person - but this movie didn't even try. I was so disappointed ... Mr. Cena, you owe me $9.50!"

Permalink",False,"Now, don't get the wrong idea. I am a wrestling fan. However, this is a movie review. I review a movie on how I think of this. I'll tell you why The Marine is not worth seeing.

First off, the movie has a weak plot. Not exactly original. Kidnapped wife, not the best. We got a few talented people here. Kelly Carlson and Robert Patrick. However they are supports. Okay, can they save this? No.

I have to say without any anti-Cena and all honesty that John Cena is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He is more wooden than a log cabin. His tough guy facials are hilarious. How did he get this role? And how is it that an experienced actor Robert Patrick have to play second fiddle? To Cena no less? Ouch. Cena's acting made the Marine hard to watch.

Also, When a movie sucks, the only resort to try and win over people is to....yep, explosions. Forget the plot, forget the story, forget the bad acting, as long as we have explosions, the movie is saved! Right? Right????

The Last Word: Utter garbage. How Cena nabbed the starring role here is going to be one of the biggest mysteries of the world. His acting is awful. The movie's script is lame, too many explosions, and did I mention Cena? I hate to say this, but Cena, don't quit your day job. Acting isn't your style."

Permalink",False,"But at least Transporter 2 was fun. Robert Patrick is the only actor worth watching in this film, and even he had some wacky forced lines that made no sense. If you've seen the trailer you've seen it all. I'm so serious! I've seen every B movie out there and this is a C for sure! Also being a Marine, I was at first blown away by how pathetic the ""Marine"" background footage was that they gave Cena. But about 1/3 of the way through this poor excuse for an action film, I was very happy that they had him wear a camouflage Army cover (hat for you non-military types) instead of a cornered Marine issue cover when he saluted that officer because neither he nor his character deserved to wear a Marine uniform. By the way, a high ranking officer would never salute a Sgt. first. It's always the other way around! Apparently there were no real Marine advisers on this movie set. Even if they had all the Marine details in order, the action was extremely stupid and I was left severely disappointed. Neither Cena nor Cena's character in this movie deserve to be called The Marine. One last thing. I've seen some people say the action is so realistic in this film. That is the furthest thing from the truth. I saw at least 300 bullets (I'm not exaggerating either) unloaded into the car Cena was driving during a chase and not a single flat tire as a result. Need I say more!?!"

People in the audience were laughing at how dumb, and I mean dumb, this movie was. The acting was horrible. The plot, what plot? The ""marine"" was indestructible. The bad guys fought among themselves and acted like a bunch of morons. After intense fighting scenes, the characters didn't have scratches or torn clothing. Everything was predictable. I honestly can not recall seeing a movie as bad as this one. The producer of this movie should be ashamed! Absolutely do not recommend wasting even a dollar at a dollar theater for this one!

Permalink",False,"The Marine is just a silly film by WWE simply to entertain it's fan base and further it's empire.For one to judge The Marine you need to take into account that this film was intended to entertain action fans with a no brainer,cheesy,action,popcorn flick and as a popcorn flick The Marine succeeds.John Cena is actually a good actor and he played his invincible,heroic,one man strike force character to perfection as did Robert Patrick with his absolutely hilarious character.The Marine has the most unbelievable stunts and at some times they are almost unbearably bad.The fight sequences are great,very intense,very hardcore, but the explosions and special effects are brutally unrealistic and cheesy.The film also has some of the most annoying,campy,corny, dialog ever captured on film.It's so bad you feel like you're re-watching 1997's Batman and Robin.As a follower of pro wrestling I'm aware that John Cena currently has a love/hate relationship with WWE fans.Females and Adolescents love Cena while Males hate him.My guess is that The Marine was made in order to change male fans opinions by making an action film that generally appeals to them.However judging by the overall IMDb rating WWE failed to do so.I wouldn't necessarily say THe Marine is a bad film but it is incomparable and can't compete with mainstream action films like The Transporter,Crank,or District B13 however if you enjoy direct to DVD action flicks that have a thin storyline but some great action scenes like Special Forces or Belly Of The Beast than The Marine is more suited to you.It's definitely not the worst film ever made and I think for the most part it's because it doesn't take itself seriously and admits it's a popcorn flick.Overall The Marine is just silly action much like wrestling and much like wrestling the characters are whacky and at times unbelievable."

Permalink",False,"As a real fan of action movies I was looking forward to a great action movie from seeing the previews however I found it disappointing. First, the whole story line with the Marine Corps is very unrealistic (don't want to spoil anything here), there a lot of big explosions, but acting is just very wooden. While I don't look for a heavy complicated plot in an action film, it is always helpful to have something to hold it together. The story line is very linear and predictable. In the theater I was in, the audience actually started laughing out loud at the predictability and cliché lines. So go for the explosions and the star is good looking (although we only see his body in one scene unfortunately) but don't expect too much from a movie produced by the WWF.

Permalink",False,"WWE champion John Cena makes his acting debut in WWE Films' ""The Marine"". No matter what all the other critics say, this film is not all that bad! I grew up during the 80's watching and loving such action flicks as Commando, Cobra, Tango & Cash, Action Jackson, and The Marine is no worse than any of those cheesy 80's films we all know and love. I believe that is the appeal of this film to me!

John Cena plays a marine by the name of John Triton. After disobeying a direct command during active duty in the Middle East, he is discharged and returns home to his wife in South Carolina. Bored with his new found freedom from the service, little does he know that some unwanted action is waiting for him.

Like I mentioned before, this is a fun action flick in the vein of the old 80's action movies. A very predictable plot, but a lot of fun! Who says that every film has to be like The Lord Of The Rings, or The Godfather to be enjoyed by people on a boring Sunday afternoon. The Marine does what it was meant to, it entertains the audience with unrealistic action and explosions.

John Cena can not act outside of the squared circle. In my humble opinion, he is not even a great wrestler, so I expected his wooden acting skills. Still, in this type of movie, who cares? Van Damme can't act either, but his early films were fun like this.

Overall, I give this film a 5/10. Great for a boring rainy afternoon, and a definite must for all 80's action fans."

Permalink",False,"Plot line is weak? Yes. The acting is bad? Well... you can't expect much acting from such a weak plot line anyway. But what I liked about this movie is that it is NOT an action movie, it is a comic action movie. Just sit back and enjoy some great explosions, fighting scenes and snappy comic remarks. I couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie. At least it looks like they didn't try to make a ""serious"" action movie. They tried to make a movie for those who enjoy WWE, I guess. And that is why I'm giving it an 8/10, since I think the movie fulfills it's purpose.

It has some of the greatest explosions I've ever seen in a movie, seriously, kudos to the SFX team. The comic remarks vary from silly things like the ""I hate rock candy"" to references to other movies (when you see the movie you'll understand). That is why I say this isn't a ""serious"" movie.

To watch this movie I suggest a few friends, some beers and turn off all brain activity. I did that and had a good time watching it. And I still use quotes from the movie to grab a quick laugh."

John Cena is very funny, very good at being macho, and is very wooden. I wouldn't suggest watching this movie if you're looking for something to pin a blue ribbon on. It's a funflick. No questions asked. As for Robert Patrick. I heard he enjoyed doing this movie. Who wouldn't, it would be fun.

I'd wager WWE made the thing in the first place because they had extra money to spend.

a very very stupid plot....an ex marine goes to a gas station with his wife...but little does he know...some jewel thief's are in that exact same gas station! they steal his wife, need her as a hostage, though they didn't really....need a hostage at all. and they walk through a forest, while cena gets whacked in the head with a fire extinguisher and a plank of wood for the only laugh factors of the film.

so we end off the film, with 20 explosions, and his wife chained up in a truck falling into a lake! and then...cena has an epic battle with the main villain everyone thought was dead! after 5 more explosions and much more crappy acting later, he beats him up and the whole place blows up with a huge explosion....he dives in for his wife....who is obviously dead at this point, brings her up, and saves her somehow....and in an ironic twist, john tritan says to his wife ""shoulda gone to da beach"" ohohohoh, hilarity ensued.

Permalink",False,"I heard that this film was a stinker so went into it with low hopes.

The cheesy salute and Cena in uniform against the flag for the opening title was so bad that I was ready to believe everything. Then he went and killed a few Arabs, rescuing some Septic soldiers in the process (or was it the other way around? It was a needless introduction anyhow). Cue one semi-sex scene, at the start of which I was thinking, ""Can this get any worse?"" and then - as if by magic - we were spared the senseless soft porn and the film picked up.

Cena takes a job as a security guard but things don't work out as planned (though they're certainly entertaining), and he and his wife decide to take some time away from it all.

Cute.

Oh, wait, because Cena - just coming back from a tour of duty in Afghanistan, which saw him being dismissed from the Core - has seen too much sand lately (or words to that effect) and they opt for a trip to the mountains instead - a decision which leads to his wife being taken hostage by a group of diamond smugglers with a penchant for killing people at random.

It's all been fun up to this point (if only somebody would have re-edited the title and chopped off the opening scene) and the tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top action suddenly goes into over-drive - much to my complete satisfaction.

Unrealistic? Ludicrous?

Well who wants to see real violence - it's not entertaining, it's sick! And ""ludicrous"" is the deus ex machina in Twelve Monkeys; nothing nearly as ill-fitting or bad as that can ever occur again - least of all in a film like this.

Give this film a chance and make your own mind up about it - that's the best advice I can offer. Take it all with the extra pinch of salt it was intended to be seen with and you might just even find yourself enjoying it too.

Oh, and in what other films does one hear terrific lines like, ""Does everything have to be racial with you?""

In order to know what I mean by that, you'll just have to watch it, but it's something I've expressed in the past to many a lip-kissing sound, so kudos for leaving the great satire in."

Of course, it's the cop from T that's driving. OK, it's a lousy description by yours truly, but get the DVD for that line alone. One highly cool special effect is when the ejected shell casing are slo-mo'd from an overhead view. The photography was good with none of the dumb blueish tint that many delta alpha directors insist upon. On a big plasma with decent 5.1 system, this flick rocks.

Robert Patrick and the other actors do not go un-noticed. I applaud this film.

Go buy this, I did the day after I rented it. You will enjoy it. 9/10

As for the comments on the fight scenes not being true to real life. Well I don't know about you but I go to the movies to watch films for there realism....NOT! I wanna see an indestructible bad-ass ripin through the bad guys. Come on this isn't reality TV, this is good old fashion action! John Cena played the role perfectly. This movie is a draw back to the old 80's action flicks like the A-team, Rambo, Camando and Delta Force. I look forward to more movies like this one. I recommend this movie to all those non-analytical types who are just looking for great action and entertainment.

Permalink",True,"I thought this movie was incredibly entertaining and filled to the brim with action, suspense, explosions and comedy. I honestly don't know why it receives such low ratings. John Cena stars as a Marine named John Triton who is being honorably discharged for disobeying a direct order. When he returns home, he decides to go on vacation with his wife, Kate. While at a gas station, Kate is kidnapped by a jewel thief named Rome, and his associates. John goes on a 1-man rampage in order to get her back. Throughout the day, Rome and his group try to kill John, but he's too stubborn to die. If you love action, I highly recommend THE MARINE!!!

Permalink",True,"""The Marine"" (2006)

Directed By: John Bonito

Starring: John Cena, Kelly Carlson, Robert Patrick, Abigail Bianca, Anthony Ray Parker, & Manu Bennett

MPAA Rating: ""Unrated"" (for intense sequences of violent action, sensuality and language)

***PLEASE NOTE: This Is A Review Of The ""Unrated"" Version Of The Movie***

Just recently, I gave ""See No Evil"" a passing grade, despite labeling it as ""one of the most clichéd and stereotypical slasher flicks ever devised"". I mention ""See No Evil"" in a review for this because they are both movies produced by WWE Films and both suffer from the same exact problem, yet both have gained my recommendation for the exact same thing. ""The Marine"" is one of the most clichéd and stereotypical action flicks ever devised (Does that sound familiar?). It stars John Cena, another wrestler trying to prove that he can act, and exists solely to have him survive as many explosive situations and kill as many bad guys as possible. Unsurprisingly, ""The Marine"" has very few new or innovative ideas to offer, which is why most people could simply skip this movie altogether and never even realize that they had missed it. However, it doesn't necessarily make for a boring watch and is certain to entertain casual moviegoers to some extentthough, said extent is probably not very far at all.

John Triton (Cena) is a recently-dismissed marine who was sent home after failing to follow orders. Kate Triton (Carlson) is his beautiful and beloved wife who supports him no matter and desires only to make him happy. Rome (Patrick) is a cruel and ruthless diamond thief who will betray anyone in order to line his own pockets. Angela (Bianca) is a cold-hearted killer who exists to serve Rome, her lover. When John and Kate are on their way to the mountains for a relaxing vacation, they happen to stop at the same gas station as Rome and Angela and their other henchmen, who have just pulled off a huge diamond heist. After a Rome's trigger-happy assistant, Morgan (Parker), shoots and kills a cop, Rome and his entourage destroy the gas station, leave John for dead, and kidnap Kate. But, John is not deadand he will do anything to save his wife. Suddenly, all hell breaks loose as John goes on a wild and explosive adventure to find his wife and bring her back home. But, what he doesn't know is that someone he thought he could trustis working for his greatest enemy.

The performances in ""The Marine"" are average at best, but they didn't really need to be any better. I didn't go into this movie thinking that it was going to have any Academy Award worthy performances. John Cena is best known (okay, so only known) for his long-time role in ""WWE Monday Night RAW"". Now, professional wrestlers are not typically good actors by any means. They are typically flat, emotionless cardboard cut-outs with muscles. Glen ""Kane"" Jacobs proved that he had what it took to portray a bloodthirsty serial killer with conviction in ""See No Evil"" so I was slightly optimistic for Cena's breakout role. Well, I got an average, but believable performance. He did a decent job. Kelly Carlson who is incredibly gorgeous, in my opinion, and quite talented also does a nice job. She first caught my attention with her provocative role in ""Nip/Tuck"" and she shows here that she can transition between television and film. Robert Patrick plays yet another villainous roleI mean, really, this is getting very predictable. I guess he does what he is good at, because he too does fine. But, the guy really needs to start taking more diverse roles.

The biggest problem with ""The Marine"", aside from its glaring lack of originality and creativity, is the overall ridiculousness of the action. When things explode in this film, they explode and destroy everything for miles aroundexcept for our hero who is thrown several feet by the explosion into safety. Our hero is tossed around, thrown out of a car that is burning and flying off of a cliff, practically blown up, shot at (by assault rifles), and more and yet he remains almost completely unscathed. What, is he a robot, for crying out loud? On top of that, the music used in the movie is almost excruciatingseriously. This is the first time in a long time where I actually thought that the music almost ruined the movie. It was dreadfuland the random bits of humor and quirky moments were even worse. The recurring jokes about rock candy had me rolling my eyes and there are other jokes that get old just as fast. The dialog, itself, is horrendous and deeply false. However, ""The Marine"" didn't need good dialog to be a decent action movie, because, let's face it, a typical action movie replaces any substance it should have had with senseless violence and action. This is not necessarily a good movie, but it is entertaining enough to warrant a watch. But, just like with so many movies released lately, do not expect anything new.

Final Thought: Ridiculously over-the-top and silly, ""The Marine"" manages to get my recommendation because it is more fun than it should be.

Overall Rating: 5/10 (B-)

Permalink",False,"As a fan of John Cena I was looking forward to seeing this movie, while its not a perfect 10 blockbuster it has lot of redeeming qualities that make it a joy to watch, one of which is the twisted humor shown by the robbers that makes you almost feel guilty for laughing. That aside its predictable and somewhat short with some surprises that are few and far between, the ending left me felling hallow but I only because it was so abrupt. If your a fan of edge or your seat exploding action movies this will not disappoint. Its fast pacing brings you quickly in to the action, As for Cena this was a good look into what he is capable of and hope to see more from him.

Permalink",False,"Being a WWE film I expected this movie to be horrendous. Their first film, SEE NO EVIL, was just there. Not really good or bad, just there. This movie, on the other hand, was quite enjoyable.

First off was the acting. Robert Patrick and Kelly Carlson were phenomenal. I found myself pleasantly surprised by John Cena's performance as John Triton. Cena, much like Stallone or Schwarzanegger, isn't going to win any awards or dramatic leads, but as far as action films go his acting was solid. Overall, the movie was quite well cast and there are only a few spots of bad - or over - acting.

The writing wasn't too terrible. There were a few spots of dialogue that were silly or unnecessary, but overall it was a standard action film. The plot, while very common, did have some unique twists. Most fans who have seen a ton of movies will be able to pick up on and guess the twists before they happen, but still enjoyable. The special effects were actually really good. I can't say enough how much I prefer to see things get blown up instead of CGId. CGI looks fake most of the time, but real explosions just look so much better.

Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. If you are an action fan, especially of films like Rambo and Predator, I'd recommend you see this film. If you're a wrestling fan, it's as good as it gets. If you like the Rock, you'll like Cena!"

Permalink",True,"Critics automatically dismissed this film because it starred a WWE Wrestler. I watched it, and thought it was a good throw back to the old school action movies. For it being his first time out, I thought John Cena did a good job. I never watched Nip/Tuck, so I did not know much about Kelly Carlson. She is definitely easy on the eyes, and did a pretty good job herself of kicking some butt in the movie. Robert Patrick was awesome as the lead villain, and his acting talents are vastly underrated. The stunts and special effects were very good. My only two complaints on the movie were the car chase after the villain's first kidnap John's wife. For the car to have that many bullet holes, and none of them hit him was a little too far fetched. The other is the scenes where they are running through the woods to get away from John and the police. They just seemed to go on way too long. Other than those two things I enjoyed the heck out of the movie, and look forward to seeing Mr. Cena get another crack at the big screen

All the stunts were done for real, and it comes across when watching from home. It had more of that kind of Jackie Chan feel, than the usual Hollywood blockbuster. To say The Marine was invincible was to miss the point, he was the anthropomorphism of all things good about America, 100% beef with extra cheese, to go, would you like fries with that, have a nice day. If your life feels empty and hollow, watch this film, it is as well and will reassure you. At last we have a true heir to van Damme and Arnie, why aren't more films made by WWE.

Permalink",True,"Underrated explosive action flick. WWE Champion John Cena plays John Triton, a heroic Marine, who is unwillingly discharged from the war in Iraq. Back in the states, he finds being a security guard is just not him. With intentions to take a short vacation, his beautiful wife Kate(Kelly Carlson)is kidnapped by a rag-tag gang led by a relentless criminal named Rome(Robert Patrick). The cold and calculated Rome steals a fortune in jewels and really doesn't plan on sharing. Rome, with Kate as a hostage, thinks he can out-smart the law, as well as his gang and girlfriend Angela(Abigail Bianca). He has no idea that Triton will stop at nothing to get his wife back alive.

If you like explosions and massive automatic gunfire, this is for you; some real amazing fight scenes too. My favorite sequence is the car chase through the South Carolina wilderness. Also in the cast: Anthony Ray Parker, Drew Powell, Manu Bennett and Jerome Ehlers.

Permalink",False,"I've just stumbled on this movie and I thought ""why not? Perhaps it's so bad it's funny"" and I must admit it showed potential on that part. First thing you'll see is the opening sequence: John Cena in a Marine official suit saluting the audience, with the American flag as background. Enormous potential for a funny trash movie.

If you read some of the best reviews here you'll find a lot of hilarious comments like ""John Cena is an excellent actor"". ""Pure '80 fun"" and ""This movie is what's so great about America"". Those people are clearly girls or boys in their teens who've been fed with MTV bull, PS2 games and cheap CGI . Let's dimanstle them in a quick way

1) John Cena is an excellent actor. If this guy was serious, and the way he wrote it would imply so, then we're in dire need of some obligatory school lessons about funny action movies 2) Pure '80 fun. No, no it's not. The '80 gave us the finest cheesy action with Commando, Rambo 2, Die Hard and so on. Those were funny movies. This movie is abysmal.

3) Let me tell you that if this movie's what's so great about America, then America must really stink as nation.

Because ""The Marine"", an action movie starring John Cena, Robert Partick, Kelly Carlson and some other useless wannabe actors doesn't even try to be ironic or make fun of itself as it should; in fact, it tries to be a serious action movie. But let's make a quick summary to help you understand the atrocity of The Marine:

plot: clichéd as hell. Those who say ""but man, this is a rad action movie, who cares about the plot??"" are forgetting that ALL the good action movies have some decent plot: Predator, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Face Off, Hard Boiled (god forbid me). This has none: villains kidnap Cena's wife, Cena smashes everything including passing through a couple of houses while hanging on a truck, Cena rescues his loved one. All this crap would actually resemble Commando, but you have a lot of humor and gags there, absolutely necessary for an over the top movie. There's zero here.

John Cena: he's probably the worst actor you'll ever see. His face remains exactly the same plain thing during the whole movie; when he kisses his wife, when he's angry, when he's sad, when he's happy, when he's a douche. Go watch the first tree you find down the road, and that's Cena's performance in a nutshell

dialogues: ... movie's in dire need of some irony, but like I already pointed out, it tries to be serious. A series of one liners trying to be funny, but they're just lame as hell. It's not even unintentionally funny. It's just boring.

in short, don't even consider renting this crap for some laughs with your friends, you'll bore them to tears. Get Taxxi, The transporter or Snatch if you want tome dumb but ultimately funny action. It's a dangerous mixture of zero plot and acting, frenzied editing, bad CGIed explosions. It's just awful. But I don't want you to miss the movie intro with Cena's salute. Come on, it's ten seconds worth of your money"

Permalink",False,"I would like to clarify up front that my rather high 8 out of 10 score is not reflective of the quality of the film. No, when it comes to the basic facets of film as a medium, ""The Marine"" is a complete and utter failure. Boasting mixed-bag acting, lousy cliché-ridden writing, laughable special effects and bizarrely over-the-top direction... this film fails as an honest attempt at crafting an action-flick.

However, in being such an overt failure, it succeeds in another way- it becomes highly entertaining as a modern example of that beloved term ""So bad, it's good."" This is one of the most wonderfully entertaining camp classics of the past few decades in my humble opinion. Right up there with ""The Room"", ""Birdemic"" and the infamously poor ""Batman & Robin."" And it is because of that extreme unintentional-entertainment value that I give it the 8 out of 10 rating. It's wonderfully bad.

The film stars WWE ""Superstar"" John Cena, portraying ex-Marine John Triton, who has recently been discharged following a messy mission in which he disobeyed direct orders. His attempts at finding peace with his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) are rudely interrupted however, when criminal mastermind Rome (Robert Patrick) and his goons end up kidnapping Kate. And so Triton is off, on a personal vendetta of vengeance as he tries to save his wife... which he accomplishes through increasingly hilariously over-the-top action sequences and explosions.

First things first, there are some things this film does well. While the action is mainly silly and unrealistic, some of Cena's fight sequences are well-done, and his in-ring experience gives him physical charisma in his role. And Robert Patrick makes for a deliciously hate-able villain whose just too much fun on-screen.

But really, that's where the ""quality"" ends and the wonderful camp- factor begins.

From the opening credits- a hilariously over-the-top ""patriotic"" bit of animation of Triton giving a superhuman-speed salute atop a massive American flag- you know this film is either trying way too hard or not hard enough... it's hard to tell, but suffice to say, the unintentional laughs begin to pile on instantly.

The ludicrous scripting brings about a lot of awkward moments, including a bizarre molestation/""Deliverance""-joke that's so out of left field, it's horrifying and funny for all the wrong reasons. And admittedly one really fun jab at co-star Robert Patrick's famed role from ""Terminator 2.""

Direction courtesy John Bonito is a blast for reasons he clearly didn't intend. Bonito just doesn't seem to grasp the concept of subtle storytelling, instead trading it in for a constant onslaught of goofy slow-motion shots and a growing number of explosions that get so ludicrous in number and scope, it's like viewing a Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular from Hell. The constant nature of the explosions becomes so hilarious, you could easily turn it into a drinking game and get well-and-plastered, because I'm not joking- just about ever other scene ends with a massive fireball explosion.

Add to that cringe-worthy dialog (just wait till you hear the ""Rock Candy"" exhange), wonky CGI, bad effects work and some really laughably bad performances by supporting actors, and you have a recipe for disaster.

But somehow (I'm guessing because of the entertainingly-bad explosions and action), that disaster becomes a beautiful visage of camp- awfulness.

I give ""The Marine"" an 8 out of 10 just for the rampant laughs it supplies audiences. (Albeit unintentionally.) One of those films you pop on with friends and beer and enjoy while making fun of it for 90 minutes."

Permalink",True,"This movie has gotten a bad rap. If you actually accept it for what it is - a good time that doesn't take itself too seriously - you will enjoy it. If you think of yourself as a ""serious action fan"" and you are the type of person who makes a habit of quoting bad boys 2, I promise you will hate this shhh.

This movie is basically a WWE wrestling match in the form of a movie. It has been translated perfectly, and anyone who enjoys pro wrestling for the fun and entertaining theater that it is will also enjoy The Marine.

I won't lie - I was expecting a total piece of shhh. But, as sometimes happens, I was nicely surprised. The trailer drew me in with its balls to the wall editing - explosions, car chases, gunfire, a beautiful woman kidnapped, a desperate man at the end of his rope, an unstoppable killing machine - in short it excited me with its simple and genuine nature. This movie delivers on the trailer's promises like few movies do, and on top of all that, it actually has subplot, semi witty characters, and jokes! You don't get that kind of package from a lot of films and I have seen enough to be able to say that with conviction.

There isn't much more to say except that this movie is just plain fun. There isn't even that much pro-America BS going on, and for a movie with a title like ""The Marine,"" you kind of expect that. John Cena and WWE are doing here what they do best: entertaining. Buy the ticket and take the ride.

I believe Bonito's influences are clear: some Hitchcock, with a dash of John Ford. Cena's acting was truly remarkable. Never for a moment did I doubt that he was John Triton, the angst-ridden husband on a desperate search for his wife. It is truly a shame that the Academy passed him over this year - a steal, I tell you! This movie is one for the history books. One can certainly find me watching this movie on any given Saturday night, popcorn and a horse tranquilizer clutched in my grubby little hands.

The car chasing scene was pretty much kick ass because if you know a little bit about Cena, you know that he likes cars so that cop car was right up his alley. (ive never seen any cop cars looking sweet as that one) One of the craziest things was at the end of the movie when Robert Patrick's character Rome who burns alive in the warehouse fire comes back all charred up wanting to go a second round but gets choked by his own chain!

If you want to honestly enjoy your movie-going experience, and not have to worry about being confused by the movie (which many of the top movies this weekend CANNOT promise), or disgusted by it, then this is an excellent choice. Good old action movie, basic plot but not much time wasted on it, patriotic and above all FUN! C'mon, I'm a girl, why don't I see more guys defending this? Try to open up your minds. Relaxation is not supposed to hurt. Fun doesn't hurt. Therefore, fun movies are more proper to relaxation. Help us turn the tide on increasingly gross and nonsensical movies and bring fun back to Hollywood. Support the Marine. And have fun doing so.

Permalink",False,"So, another small budget film by WWE, what are they thinking? without a good and a solid story line how can they expect to do well? Saw an early preview, i had high hopes after watching the trailer but the movie didn't live up to it, short, cramped, the ending really didn't make sense.

After See no evil they thought an action movie would do the trick but i guess or lets say i hope they should end it here. The acting was actually not so bad considering this was Cena's first movie he did a good job. But his acting alone cannot make the movie good.

I'd say that they should take some time, develop a good plot, pick a good director and then only move on to make a movie.

Really a waste of precious time and effort though it was free! I'd give it 5/10 (mainly because i sympathize with Cena who did a good job).

Permalink",False,"I saw The Marine earlier today and I thought it was great. It's not the greatest movie ever but it has all the elements of a great action movie. Lotsa explosions, a real ticked off guy, a hot girl, and more explosions for an hour and a half. People are going to crap on this movie simply because it's John Cena. Some people really need to ease up. Give the guy his due! I mean really when you watch you'll notice that most of Cena's scene's are pretty short simply because of his limited acting experience on the big screen, but when he is there he's pretty darn good I thought. So if you are an unbiased person reading this PLEASE don't let other people tell you that John Cena ruined the movie because he doesn't. Go see it. Go in expecting some big hits, and a few laughs along the way and you'll enjoy this movie a lot more. Kudos to John Cena for a real good first try.

If you saw this movie expecting a message about crime, the military, or anything else for that matter; you went to the wrong movie. It's produced by the WWE as a vehicle for Sena to flex his enormous muscles and kick some butt. That's it. No message. The WWE champ is portrayed as a good guy who won't let anything get between him and saving his wife's life. The only reason I'm not giving this movie a ""10"" is that there was a sort subplot with two smugglers that was never finished, and one character's fear of rock candy was never explained. It's like Maxim magazine on the screen.

Permalink",True,"This may contain spoilers. I am sad to say that this movie is terrible. I am in John Cena's Chain Gang, and I can't even think of anything positive to say about this movie. The script is terrible, the acting laughable, the action uninspired, awful directing, it's too short. There is no character development of anyone, and this movie is ultimately forgettable. I hope Cena sticks to wrestling and doesn't think that this movie is a success by any means. The action sequences are overly ridiculous, in reality anyone including The Terminator would get wasted by them. The acting consists of many one liners and if you have seen the previews you can probably quote all the major lines from the movie. No characters have any chemistry besides Cena and his wife. Being in the Chain Gang, would make you think I love everything Cena does. Normally this is true, I like his CD, but I don't like this movie. Looney Tunes music plays at one time and accurately describes this movie.

However, unlike the herd of sheep that recently followed each other jumping off a Turkish cliff, i decided to give ""The Marine"" a chance and ended up being pleasantly surprised.

""The Marine"" encompasses the very three attributes that i believe are necessary to make a film successful, action, comedy and romance.

John Cena and Robert Patrick perform admirably in their respective good guy, bad guy roles. I recommend this movie to every free thinking individual.

Permalink",False,"Do not see this movie if you are really into performances and acting, because this is not that type of movie. It is Violent! Quite Violent! Yet if you like bullets and explosions and fires and crashes and other destruction sequences, then this movie works. It is a typical far fetched action movie, where the main actor is ""SUPERHUMAN"", but is really a mere mortal with skills that would make him a superman without the ability to fly ---- no wait I think he does fly in many of the explosions. Plot is almost non-existent. The bad guy --- from terminator II --- is really a bad guy and admits to being insane and acts accordingly. There is some humor regarding the Terminator during a car chase and appears to be intentional, and it is cued so the audience should catch it clearly. There are some scenes that drag out and you can see the bad acting in those, but for the most part killing or getting killed does not require great acting and there is a LOT of that! Overall it is entertaining, if only for all the violence and explosions with neat fire effects ... some almost look like little nukes with high yields. If you have NOTHING better to see, then this is a movie for you.

I got my fighting and explosions, but the plot was more that I hoped for. It wasn't great, but it was good for an action film. It had enough to keep the movie going. John Cena played a classic action star to the T. Our group of villains also had just enough evil and just enough comedy to keep me entertained. Definitely worth a watch.

It was decent. i mean the only reason why it was good is cause john Cena was in the building and we has to give him love. It was packed with Marines in uniform and everything. John Cena acted pretty well for this first role on film. But the story and the whole flow gave me a 7. but it was an 8 1/2 just for being the world premiere. If you ain't looking for an Oscar-winning movie, then see this. if you think this movie was better than hype, don't even bother watching it then dissing it later.

Maybe if you like pure action movies, just seeing stuff blow up and car chases, I'd tell you that you could find better things on YouTube. WWE should stick to wrestling. They also shouldn't be worried about Cena leaving like 'The Rock' anytime soon, because those two are on two different levels. I'm glad I didn't have to pay to see this movie because I would have asked for a refund. IT WAS THAT BAD. My friend dragged me to it, paid for my ticket, and he even thought it blew ass. I don't know what pole you people are smoking for thinking this movie was good, did you see the same movie i did?? Or maybe you wrestling fans are being bias. Nevertheless, this movie won't be in the theaters long so look for it on DVD by Christmas. Honestly I have good movie taste, Scarface, Collateral, The Negotiator, Godfather, Bad Boys 2, are among my favorite movies. So if you trust my opinion, I wouldn't go to this movie again if I received money, it was that bad.

Permalink",False,"I really liked this movie. I respectfully disagree with many of the negative comments.

I certainly agree that it's not going to win Oscars, end global warming, contribute any trends to society (although I find myself telling people, ""Good luck with all that."" Great line!), or bring people closer to God or the devil.

It won't even make you cry, but it will make you laugh. It's FUNNY! The bit with Rome's eyebrows was hilarious. So was the rock candy/summer camp/Johnny Whipflash story!

John Cena's acting is not brilliant, but it's appropriate for the character. The other actors seemed to be having a good time, and Robert Patrick is a very handsome hoot in this film! What a lovely contrast from stuffed shirt never-smile Tom Ryan on The Unit. ""Rome"" reminded me of an ""nasty"" James Bond.

I agree that for those who have been involved with the military, there is a lot of inaccuracy. The screenwriter definitely asks us to ""suspend reality"" not just once, but many times. That's OK. I expected this going into the movie. I didn't expect a documentary about the Marine Corps or the police force. I'll look for authenticity in high art films like Flags of our Fathers, but not in action flicks.

I think The Marine is fun and highly entertaining. Yes, the plot was simple. But it made sense and it held together. It had all the elements of a decently-designed screenplay: an inciting incident, several ""turning points,"" a climax, and a resolution. I especially loved Plot Point I--stopping at the gas station. I knew it wasn't a good idea for Cena to stop at the gas station. I was yelling at the screen--""Don't stop at the gas station, fool!""

It was an action movie with a lot of burning buildings and explosions and shootings and fistfights and smart-ass lines from the villain.

Thankfully there was no gore, no upturned dismayed corpse faces, no twitching death throes, no spewing guts, no blood (except on the diamonds--cool!). There wasn't even a lot of swearing in the movie. And no nudity. Yee hah! It's a kids' movie, and as a very old kid, I had a great time.

It reminded me of the kind of movies my brother and I used to be allowed to watch. Gangsters vs. good guys, and justice is served in the end. Fun for us to act out in the backyard the next day with all our neighborhood buds.

Now please don't get the wrong idea. I'm not recommending that responsible parents load the kiddies into the mini-van and head to The Marine. There are a lot more wholesome and inspiring activities for children than watching people shoot each other. But I think the movie, by and large, is more ""wholesome"" than some of the violent stuff on TV. Definitely OK for young teens, as long as they are mentally sound and not likely to start imitating John Triton or thinking that the Iraq war is just a big video game.

And I personally loved the music. I am a professional pianist and I do a lot of work with children and teenagers. The Marine soundtrack didn't sound like porn to me. It reminded me of the music on the old soap opera, Dark Shadows. Lots of ""drone"" in the background, and extremely clever use of percussion. I loved the way the composer utilized bits and pieces from other movies (e.g., Deliverance). Corny, but fun for old kids! And I loved the way the composer wrote ""themes"" for each of the characters. This device was used in many old movies (e.g., Gone With The Wind), and it was a nice surprise in this movie. The military Theme Song was awesome--I've actually recommended it to several ice skating coaches that I know."

Permalink",True,"John Cena is an excellent actor, singer (""If It All Ended Tomorrow"" on the movie with his cousin Tha Trademarc), and in my opinion, completely and totally hot. He did a great job in the movie, especially with his first time doing a movie like that. He did a really excellent part when he was driving the car at really high speeds, considering some of the driving stunts are really hard to do if you're actually the one behind the wheel doing it. His character was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps for not following a direct order, went home to his wife, throws a guy out of a building window that tries to get in a fight with John Triton (John Cena's character), and kills a few people to get his kidnapped wife back to safety and back to him. I think that John Cena was a fantastic actor in the movie and that the movie is excellent!

Permalink",True,"Before you watch this movie, you have to understand it's entertainment so if it's not as realistic as you feel it should be, the fault isn't with the movie makers. Remember they do have creative license and they use it to the fullest in this movie. With that said, I enjoyed the movie. It's kind of like the military version of ""Speed"". Kelly Clarkson was great. I think John Cena was great too but it would have been a little better if Cena used his wrestling persona a bit more. That's how Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson got successful in movies and why he's now branching to comedies. When Cena gives wrestling promos there is usually a lot of comedy involved just like the Rock. I am giving this movie a lot of leeway, rating wise, because it is Cena's first but I believe he can get better. The bad guys were horrible...it was stupid to let them start killing each other. I think one of the things that damaged this movie was the time limit....90 minutes. Had they expanded to 120, maybe they could have worked harder on character development but I did enjoy the movie. I saw it on cable though so I didn't pay anything extra. :)

The characters at points were almost believable. And there were a couple funny spots. I just was looking for a movie that was more life like and less of what people know could and could not literally happen.

I went to the very first showing at our local movie theater, so I was one of the first ones to see it in our general area. There were kids there, which being a Friday I was sort of surprised at. Shouldn't they be in school? Anyway, the movie itself was pretty good. The beginning started off pretty slow, they had to setup the fact that he came back from the Marines (opening scene with him as a Marine was AWESOME), and the fact that he was having trouble adapting to life as a security guard (I don't want to give anything away here, so I won't say another word about it). Once the kidnapping happens, it really takes off. I personally think Robert Patrick stole the show as Rome. There was a ""Terminator"" reference, which he didn't seem to enjoy that much. For those of you who don't know, Robert Patrick was the T-1000 in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. The one thing that I didn't like was the music. Half the time it sounded like something out of a bad porn movie, not that I would know what those sound like. Everything else makes it just a good action flick. This definitely won't go down as an all time classic, but for movie fans and WWE fans, this is definitely worth the money."

Permalink",False,"""The Marine"" did really live up to the hype. It's one of the best action films I've seen in a long time. Starting the charismatic John Cena who is perfect in his role, John Triton (or The Terminator you may call),with great supporting roles like Kelly Carlson and Robert Patrick. The Marine has surprisingly good acting for action genre film.

If you have seen the trailer of The Marine, you may think the trailer has give away every interesting things from the film. But in fact, the trailer only give away a very little bit of the film. The Marine is full of surprises, twists and actions, and doesn't contain too many typical action cliché.

The Marine is full non-stop adrenaline action and has a very deep storyline that'll keep you occupied. It's a lot better than the mediocre previous WWE film ""See No Evil"". If you are into great pop-corn flick, or looking for a throw back to classic 80's action film. Don't miss it!

Permalink",True,"The amount of explosions in this movie is quite lame. Triton survives all of the explosions, and suffers no burns from the fire/heatwave/shock-wave. As the person below me said, High ranking officers do not salute low ranking officers. Never.

When the gas station first blows up, Robert Patrick looks down at the police interceptors front left tire, sees it is flat, and tells his men to grab the truck instead. Cena runs after the car, and drives like a bat out of hell, turning, braking, and accelerating with at least 3 flat tires, and 100 bullets in his engine.

After he stabs and kills Morgan, he kills another person, and as he goes to lay him down next to Morgan, there is no blood dripping from Morgans mouth, or any blood on the outlaying ground around him.

There is also an overhead shot over-looking a pistol, the bullets are flying up, but in real life they eject to the side.

I was extremely disappointed in this movie overall, Rating this one and wish i could get my money back.

Now lets give John Cena his due in the big screen. He did a rap CD, now he's got this movie that is action-packed called ""The Marine"". John Cena plays John Triton, a seargant(E5) in The Marine Corps. This guy is a juggernaut when he took out al-Qaida in Iraq. But when he is honorably discharged, he became, uncertain on what's next. Most Marines find something out of the Corps, Triton on the other hand in civilianly challenged. That changes when a group of dangerous killers robbed a jewelry store, and take his beautiful wife, Jane(Kelly Carlson, Nip/Tuck) hostage. All that training from the Marine Corps really paid off for Cena. The fighting, the stealth, and the rescue were all in hand for this movie. He knows he wouldn't let his wife drown in that truck, nor would he let those killers get away with killing those cops and such. That Camaro squad car had some serious horsepower, and the cronies were having nothing but frustrations with him and each other. There were some sappy moments there, but the explosions, the stunts, and the action was never lost in the movie. John Cena puts the ""O"" in OORAH! and the ""S"" in ""Semper Fi""!

Permalink",False,"This was a very entertaining action movie. I really like John Cena in this movie. Robert Patrick was kick ass in this film!!!!!!!!! I actually met him while at work one day. He and a couple friends rode their motorcycles to my job and hung out with me for a few hours!!! Very cool Guy. Great Movie!!! The action scenes were great and very exciting. There was even a Vandamme leaping 360 degree spin kick in here. The acting was great in this movie and john cena really surprised me with this debut effort. Nobody touches Robert Patrick's performance though. He Rocks in every movie he is in and is one of my favorite actors. No disappointment here!!!! Go see this movie!!

Permalink",False,"OK, seriously, I'm not saying some people must like this movie, nor hate it. I'm just asking you to be honest... A lot of people are fair in their review but a lot of you are giving the WWE films awful ratings simply because it's a WWE film. On the other hand people rate it a 10 because of that. I'm a WWE fan, but I rate the movies honestly, I give The Marine an 8 because it is a non-stop action movie, with a good storyline, and it has some really creative, original and awesome scenes... You have great actors too, just because Cena is a wrestler doesn't make him a bad actor. He's no Hulk Hogan. Also, don't judge the movie on whether or not you like John Cena as a wrestler...

it's definitely worth watching, WWE fan or not...

Permalink",True,"over all i was amused by the movie, if for no other reason than they had to blow something up to get Cena to go in the water above his boots. Yes it was predictable, from the previews you could tell that. But it did kill 90 minutes, and the black guy was quite amusing with his rock candy story. Unlike some movies that have nothing but bad clichés and bad jokes, i did laugh out loud a couple of times. would i give this movie a grade higher than C, no. But if it comes to a choice between something with Woody Allen or this, i will watch this movie again. The chick-fight was one of the better chick fights I've seen this year in a movie.

Permalink",True,"I am going to go against the grain with this one and give it a good rating for sheer entertainment. John Cena as Marine John Triton looks like the Incredible Hulk without the green makeup. He hits, he gets hit, but he always bounces up ... eventually ... and keeps on going.

The movie opens with him in Iraq, and making a very daring rescue of some fellow GIs being tortured by the enemy. But when his tour of duty is up and he is discharged, he ends up working as a security guard, a most boring job for a man of action.

He and his wife, pretty Kelly Carlson as Kate Triton, are on a road trip and while stopped at a gas station and some bad guys, led by ""terminator"" Robert Patrick as Rome create some havoc. This leads to an extended chase.

This is not a movie to be taken seriously. I watched it with two high school seniors and we laughed often. Even the bad guys have funny lines. There are explosions, lots of spectacular explosions, and all of them are exciting. When a gruesome death is depicted, the camera does not show the details, which is good. We enjoyed this movie as a fun 90 minutes of action and rooting for the good guys. Cena is perfect for this kind of role.

SPOILERS. At the gas station incident Kate ends up being kidnapped. A cop is killed so John takes the car and chases them, in what ends up being a most spectacular road chase with bullets flying everywhere, and the cop car ends up being totally destroyed, but John survives, being thrown in the water. Later he tracks them down to a camp in the swamp, where the final disposition of the bad guys happens, and Kate is saved.

I was not looking for an Oscar performance and did not receive any, but for a simple entertaining action movie its really not bad. Anyone criticizing this movie harshly just didn't know what they were getting into or did not bother to read the description on the jacket. See it when you don't want to think too extensively, because come on, sometimes you just want to see stuff explode.

Permalink",True,"I saw The Marine to see if they could make a classic 80's action movie. I was not expecting it to be ""good"" by any realistic definition. I expected a mindless action movie, which is a genre I love. I did somewhat enjoy it for that reason, but it fell pretty far below the better examples of classic 80's action.

It was more like Raw Deal or Cobra than Commando or Predator. The set pieces were not very inspired. The scene at the gas station was decent, and the car chase was about the same. Everything after that was sub par. How many ""running through the swamp"" shots are needed? The drug dealer scene did nothing for the movie. There should have been more tension between the cops and Triton. The movie seemed to be setting up a lot of problems with Rome's financiers, but there was no payoff there. The three way stand off between the detective, Rome and Triton should have been the second act climax, but it was handled poorly and had almost no emotional impact.

Rome and Morgan provided the best dialogue in the movie. It was fairly entertaining, and it was needed since Triton seemed incapable of extended dialogue. This is a standard of most action movies. The villain is usually the most interesting character, and I had no problem with this aspect of the movie.

Obviously most 80's action movies have a paper thin plot. That isn't a big deal if they can make inspired action sets. The third act of the movie should have taken place in a different location. It seemed to be setting up a change of location, but that never took place. As it was from the point that they left the road until the end was just one running set.

The movie should be critiqued in the genre it belongs in. Going by that standard it was sub par. It mentioned or set up several things that never got paid off. It had little change in action or set from the beginning of the second act forward. And the worst part was that it just got boring. That is the ultimate mistake in an action film.

I for one am tired of Matt Damons and Ben Affleck trying to be real action stars. I think its great to have someone who can pull off the action and be realistic. Maybe Jon Cena isn't't the greatest actor in the world. But in movies like this, its not needed. So all you highbrow people who can't just go and escape into the movies. You all need to loosen up and relax and enjoy yourselves. Go and see this movie..Yep Cena isn't Leo or Matt..But he is a lot more fun to see in a action movie.

Permalink",False,"When I saw the previews, I groaned at another boom boom exploding action movie. When realizing John Cena was the star and that WWE made this film the entire theatre burst out in laughter and I mean this literally. The guy behind me asked his friend if that was a joke promoting WWE television. It wasn't.

The movie is poorly acted, directed, written, and produced. Someone must have thought they were re-shooting terminator II because the effects were abysmal and ancient. Every scene reminded me of a Rambo rip off from the late 80's. The acting of John Cena was up to par with his television appearances mediocre, dry, and stale. You would think WWE would try to put this wannabe Schwarzenagger with some decent name actors to sell the movie. A buddy, a known hot chick, a villain who is known for something other than the ability to morph.

Honestly I saw this movie because a coworker heard I liked wrestling and bought me a ticket to opening night in return for a solid I did him a week ago. Never in a million years would I have paid to see this. I contemplated walking out, but since I didn't pay I couldn't ask for my coworker's money back. I half expected John Cena to do a FU followed by an STFU at the end. To sum up this review in a monosylabic way...ugh"

Permalink",True,"*****SPOILER ALERT*****

After the first 10 minutes I nearly switched off the DVD as this movie was just so beyond ridiculous that I could feel my brain shrinking as I watched it. I mean, it starts in an Al Qaeda compound in Iraq which as we all know are numerous (sigh) with John Cena pulling a Rambo to free 2 hostages (which somehow turns into 3 hostages running out of the building....continuity or making sense isn't the strong suit of this movie....). He just shoots up the place Rambo style (while screaming and in plain site) and manages to kill everyone except the 2 (3?) hostages. This kind of nonsensical stupidness is what you see through out the movie, so just relax, get some pop corn and have a laugh 'cause this movie has it all: -the cheapest blue screen effects ever -the corniest music : blaxpoitation music meets dirty dancing music (yes that is actually possible) -bad guys firing literally thousands of bullets a second and not hitting our ""hero"" who manages to protect himself with a bullet proof vest...held in one hand! (that's our boy!) -growling and barking alligators (!!???) -The crappiest one liners EVER -And a John Cena who has the acting ability of....a trowel? I swear this guy looks like a cro-magnon.

I give it a 6, why? Because it's hilarious, it's so bad it's actually a good comedy...not on purpose...but oh well...

I would not pay a lot to own it, but I might buy it at the swap meet for a few dollars, just to have those cheesy lines!

Permalink",True,"I have never had more fun watching such a bad movie before. My friends and I are big wrestling fans, so we had to see this film. We knew it would be bad, so we waited til it went to the cheap theater to see it. We spent two dollars to see it, and I think it was well worth it. No more than 5 minutes into the movie we erupted into laughter. John Cena is a decent wrestler, but a terrible actor. His sad attempts at showing any kind of emotion, even being mad(which, being a wrestler, you would think he might have down) were hilarious!

After being discharged, Cena gets a job as a security guard at a hotel. His partner could be the worst actor ever. Next in line are the bad guys. They rob a jewelry store then blow up a car in the middle of a huge city, and draw pretty much no attention. They then kidnap Cenas girlfriend at a gas station and blow it up. They literally blow off all the metal from Cenas car, then he wrecks into a lake. He clearly does this huge dive out of the car into the water. They know he is a marine at this point, but assume he will just drown and let him go.They are ruthless enough to kill a bunch of their own gang for nothing, but keep Cenas girlfriend alive as a hostage, though there is no logical reason to do so while trekking through swampland. Later on, Cena waits on one of the bad guys to come out of a cabin they are staying in, kills him, then about 15 minutes later one of the bad guys comes to check on the first on, and Cena kills him. And no one thinks anything is suspicious. I think Robert Patrick is a great actor, but he must have been paid a lot of movie to do this thing. He even acts goofy the whole time,like he knows the movie stinks.In one scene, he tells his partner over the phone that he is cut out of a deal, gets a beep, asks the guy to hold, and the guys response is yeah,sure. They even play looney tunes music in this movie.

The best was yet to come. While on a trip with his wife, they fall into the hands of a jewelry robbing gang, who takes the wife hostage. There is all sorts of mayhem with great special effects. Wait until you see who the leader of the pack is. It should come as something as a surprise, but in films, there are really no surprises.

The gang is lead by a sadistic leader who blows away his own people at a whim.

This essentially becomes a cat and mouse chase with our marine and the sadistic guy having more than 9 lives in surviving all the carnage.

The main character survives four and five explosions! Yes, he's a marine and those guys are tough but come on! The rock candy storyline with the black dude was more annoying than funny and didn't seem to have a purpose. Were we supposed to feel sorry for him? And why the heck would John Triton throw the secretary's ex-boyfriend through a glass window? You know you're gonna get fired for doing that. And what was the point of the two guys in the woods capturing John thinking he was a cop? Just to put more unnecessary emphasis on the fact that he's tough and can survive anything almost unscathed? What were they so afraid of getting caught doing? The movie was alright for WWE's standards but in general...I'd skip it.

Permalink",False,"John Cena is ....The Marine! This is pretty much what you might expect from a movie of this nature. A big action packed romp with really bad bad guys and pristinely heroic good guys and exploding everything else. Which is not to say that it is a total waste of time, mind you. I have, perhaps sadly, seen far worse than The Marine in my time.

John Cena seems a little ill at ease at first but grows into the character of John Triton(I have to admit that is a pretty cool name)in the latter two thirds of the film. Robert Patrick is a gem in this role and he plays the subtle insanity of his character perfectly, after all it was not his fault that the role was woefully under developed. The saving grace of the movie is without doubt Kelly Carlson. She simply steals the movie in her role as John's wife.

The single biggest failing of this project, in my opinion, is by far the script. In fact I would not be surprised if there was no script at all, and just a loose amalgamation of stuff exploding and fight sequences. And they left it to the actors to improv the bits in between. The plot(where detectable)is barely kept together by spit and dental floss and the characters are under developed and one dimensional. As for back stories - Who needs 'em? The editing was also something I found annoying as it becomes a victim of itself in trying to keep the fast pace of the film up. The film is however very stylized and attractive to watch.

Permalink",False,"This was John Cena's first feature film, and I wish it was his last. Sadly, it wasn't. The guy is as exciting as a log, and doesn't have any of the charisma that is needed to make an action star. I believe it's the stiffest acting I've seen in all my life, and it says something when I'm complaining about the acting in a movie where it shouldn't matter. This shows that a steroid pumped body isn't the only thing an action hero needs to be successful. In addition to Cena's abysmal performance, the story sucked, the action sucked, everything sucked, I wasted my time and was just waiting for the movie to end to put me out of my misery. Stay far away from this garbage.

Permalink",True,"For the uninitiated, he Marine is the second movie production of WWE Films. It features then-WWE Champion John Cena as a former Marine named John Triton (real creative in making the protagonist's first name as the same as the actor's. I'm sure Tony Danza would approve) who must save his girlfriend from a bunch of criminals. From there, we get a second-rate action movie that seems to rip off every single action movie in the book until the inevitable conclusion. Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring and read a book, which was unfortunately far more entertaining and enlightening.

The good news is that The Marine is not the worst movie I have bore witness to; that (dis)honor belongs to the Halle Berry flick Catwoman. However, The Marine isn't a bad movie in the sense that it's so bad it's good. It's a bad movie in the sense that it's not really that interesting or even exciting. For every action movie cliché this movie churns out, you can probably think of thrice as many flicks that could pull off the same trick, but better. ""Perty 'plosions"" are nice and all, but mean nothing if there isn't a strong backstory or even a remotely interesting conflict to drive the action. The Marine has neither of these things and it ends up being a ho-hum action film with a generic plot line. Not even the T-1000 himself, Robert Patrick, could save this flick.

I rarely have a good thing to say about Cena because I'm not a fan of his wrestling work, but given some good material, he could possibly shoot out a couple good movies. Those movies aren't going to come from WWE Films, however. He has the talent and charisma to drive the movie, but the material he's given is absolute garbage.

If you're a fan of Cena, just stick with watching his matches and promos on RAW and avoid this movie. Trust me; you're better off watching his crappy matches than his crappy movie.

Not even IMDb's ""goofs"" section for this film details it! After the shooting of the first trooper at the gas station, they open fire on the interceptor vehicle. The camera closely details that at least one of the tires were blown out during this barrage. Despite this fact, the ""marine"" is able to accelerate and enter pursuit of the hilarious ""bad guys."" I also feel the need to point out that the gas station would not have exploded; underground tanks are required to have a pressure relief system in the event of fire, and even then, only exposed gasoline could burn and become explosive. Also, regardless of department, all LE officers have ""PD"" badges on their lapels, and all patches are generic.

Permalink",False,"There are some circumstances under which you would find THE MARINE an amazing film. Some of them include:

a) You can't get enough straight-to-DVD Dolph Lundgren.

b) You're a pyromaniac 11-year-old boy riddled with ADD.

c) You found COMMANDO to be ""a bit too deep.""

Unless you fit into one of these categories, steer clear of this awfully written/executed star debut for pro wrestler John Cena. Here the big guy is a Marine who doesn't know what to do with himself after his discharge. After his wife is kidnapped at a gas station, his training comes in quite handy as he tracks down the gang of thugs holding her in the woods.

Cena is actually not all that bad. He can hardly be blamed for the crapulescence that is THE MARINE; there is much blame to go around. The writers deserve special shame for a cliché ridden script that attempts to get us through the slow spots with one pointless explosion and/or shooting after another. Robert Patrick returns to the screen as a villain, but the talent he showed in T2 is overshadowed by the one-dimensional evil his character displays. Anthony Ray Parker, as one of the thugs, embarrasses himself with tired ""black guy"" dialog that tries so hard to be funny and timely but fails oh-so miserably.

I didn't know that John Cena was a wrestler before I rented THE MARINE. I guess that's the only thing that really makes sense here. Cena attracts a certain kind of viewer, one with no time for things like plot, direction or creativity. They won't be disappointed. It's not ""the worst piece of crap"" ever, as one IMDb reviewer called it, but there's certainly no reason anyone should ever view it again."

The action sequences were way over done and just completely unbelievable. Seriously, even a Marine would be dead after some of that stuff. I think the film motto was ""more fire.""

Truthfully, giving it a two, is really stretching it, but you can't be too harsh, it is a WWF (or whatever it is) movie, so it is not like anything is actually expected to begin with.

All that matters is that is was a great movie and you can learn something from it. I mean give John Cena some credit he just wanted to try something new and he did a great job. So watch it over and over again and you'll get to like it or your just not into action because this movie was off the hook. Watch it people and spread it out!

Permalink",True,"There is a higher force at work in John Cena's THE MARINE. What most casual viewers fail to recognize about the film is that it is not a serious action film, but much more. No, THE MARINE is not a clever satire by a snarky director, but in fact a devilish, virulent attack against the nature of the genre itself by a neo-new wave artist who so hates it that he wishes to both destroy the viewer and the viewed in one attack.

Cena and his vehicle are shot at with hundreds of bullets. The movie makes clear and conscious depiction of his tires being shot out, but shows zero effect on the situation for it. The car doesn't swerve, slow down, or explode (like everything else in the movie). Rather than being a James Bond, who is constantly shot at and never hit, he and the vehicle he drives absorb the damage and simply say ""no"" to it. It refuses to acknowledge the damage done to it. The filmmakers, in showing this, are conscious of the conventions of the genre and bring it to the next level.

His wife, spending several minutes underwater and drowned is brought back to life with Cena's tender care - the filmmakers showing that the same hands which destroy life are the same which give it back, a thoughtful and intriguing commentary on the banal ""that which creates can also destroy"".

Watching the film is like being 14 again, playing through DOOM 2 on Ultra Violence, unabashedly charging through the game using rare and powerful cheat codes, and standing proudly at the conclusion for what you have accomplished. The filmmakers show this is the case in every action movie, and simply display it on such a scale to put the flaws on display for the world.

So, sit back and enjoy. THE MARINE is a heady affair, a wine to be savored and appreciated. But be aware, it is not concerned with today's publics, but the publics of the future, in fifty years from now. That is all it cares about. That is when its influence will shine.

On a special note Cena's wife (Kelly Carlson) didn't act like the wimpy cry-baby female that can't come to grips that I've seen from the film industry dating back to the late 1930's. With Arnold, Sly, Eastwood, Norris, Van Damme and all the others not putting out any new films it's great to see John Cena and of course, ""The Rock"" (not in this film) picking up where the others left off.

Review by Larry Stanley www.penguincomics.net

Dear sweet baby Jesus please take the memory of this film from my brain, Amen. Well? Nope, still there. Crap, I wish I had known this was a WWE film before I went in, I might have had a better idea of what to expect. See, I have not watched wrestling on TV since I was in pro wrestling back in Memphis. Now, the guys and girls involved in the sport back then werewell Colorful. To say the least; but they had talent. I wonder if Jerry Lawler could have become King today if it meant acting like some of the guys I see when I switch channels. Naw, Jerry Lawler will always be King. Anyway, about this movie. I have been waiting all summer for a really good action adventure. I am talking John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson type action adventure. Even Arnie type would have been a great way to go. But we get John Cena, a wrestler who has had most of his experience as an actor standing around in shorts either getting hit or hitting someone else. Whee. Now don't get me wrong, there were gunshots, explosions and even action in the movie. But, there is also action in a Road Runner cartoon, and once in a while explosions. And about as much adventure and excitement. But maybe not as much humor. Cena is John Triton, a former Marine who faces off against a band of dangerous killers who have taken his wife hostage. Surviving explosions (at least 3) having a car literally torn to pieces around him by bullets, falling out of a car doing close to a 100 as it hits a river (and explodes in mid air) being shot at repeatedly he does what you would expect him to do. That is John Cena's role in the movie; to run, hit things, be hit, jump and look around with a blank look on his face as much as possible. Even the attempts at emotion seemed to be difficult for him to master. Cena is no Rock, at least not yet. Maybe with ten or eleven more movies under his belt he could have a shot, but for now go back to following the script you get for the ring. What was most disappointing was Robert Patrick as the leader of the killers, Rome. My God, what did they have to pay you to star in this trash? Were they holding someone you loved hostage? Did they have incriminating photos? Please, if they do a sequel, don't come back as your twin brother, Remus. As it is, I think I will have a tough time watching The Unit without snickering once in a while. What the heck was all this winking and motioning toward your girlfriend? Were you (or the writer/director) actually trying to make an unintentionally funny film even more stupid? Sure, there were some decent attempts at a laugh. I still liked the Terminator joke, and Morgan's story about Johnny Whiplash and Rock Candy gets a chortle when I think of it, but other than the many attempt on the Super-Marine's life, this film was not even as funny as the earlier mentioned Road Runner cartoon. Please, if you are a Marine don't go see this. Well, actually if you need a decent laugh I guess you could go. But non-Marines or those who don't know anything about them, stay home. Marines are not indestructible. They don't survive point blank explosions or gun fire. Just look at the number of coffins being shipped back from the Middle East to prove it. This film almost ridicules the Marine Corp. And if I had known that was the plan, I would have watched paint dry before I watched this film.

I found this reaction surprising, since the movie was just about what I expected after see the preview. It was an non-stop, action packed shoot em up from start to finish. There were some scenes that seemed out of place, but they too were used for their action opportunity.

John Cena was quite believable as a no nonsense ""tough"" marine. And Robert Patrick is a very believable ""bad guy"".

They didn't take themselves too seriously, as indicated by the summary comment. Robert Patrick's expression, when the comment is made, is excellent!

Suspension of disbelief was required, however. The amount of punishment that John Triton takes during this adventure is incredible. It made me wonder if we were supposed to think that this guy has the recovery power of Wolverine from the X-men."

Permalink",True,"If I wanted plot, I'd go see The Departed. If I wanted, acting, I'd go see The Departed. If I wanted polished directing ......... well, you get my drift. For my money, I got a well paced, (for a first time director) funny, action movie. (note that I didn't use the term film). From the opening shot of John Cena in an ill-fitted Marine uniform through the first couple of scenes with enough corny lines to have me ready to reach for a sick bag, I was certain I'd made a mistake in our choice for a Saturday night date flick. The last few films we'd seen were testosterone driven. I wanted a chick-flick. Nothing heavy. Just some laughs. I got exactly what I was looking for. Okay, so it wasn't a chick flick and YES it was testosterone driven, but it was also, fun, funny, silly and plot less. What more could a gal ask for when ordering fluff? I wasn't expecting Godiva Chocolate, it was good old-fashioned Bazooka bubble-gum. John Cena was wisely given very few lines. His acting only suffered when he was required to be still and deliver short paragraphs of dialogue. But his brooding stares were confection. He's got a great face for flat-affect performance. I didn't need him crying for the reason he is set on his ""MISSION"". He's got a great body and I'm sure that he spent much more time working on that rather than his acting ability. The jeweled performances came from, Anthony Ray Parker as Morgan, some muscle with a trigger finger and a thing about rock candy. He has some funny material which he delivers with all the fun intact. Most of his amusing dialogue is delivered with Robert Patrick, playing Rome, the mastermind in charge of the jewel heist that sets this action movie going full throttle. Patrick, who began his career with a flat-affect performance in Terminator 2, enjoys making fun of his character who, like the Terminator, can walk away from the destruction and mayhem with no remorse. I don't believe the women were there as eye-candy. (In my very limited knowledge of WWE) Kelly Carlson plays John Cena's wife in WWE shouting matches; a feisty little bit of a woman with a nice set of cojones when it comes to dealing with a bad situation. Abigail Bianca seemed to be her foil, the person she needed to play off most of her anger, as opposed to Robert Patrick who chewed scenery like ..... let's see ....... hmmmm bubble-gum. Patrick and Carlson have a wonderful little scene in which we can see, he's really not out to get her or make her suffer in the least. As a matter of fact, you almost expect you see her crack up over the absurdity of it all. I'll forget this movie in a week. So what? It was good for what it was.

This movie made it seem like marines are the baddest of the bad and that is not even true. Yeah we are crazy trained killers ... but seriously? we are human just like everyone else. This so called marine is superhuman in this movie and they could have toned it down a lot. I was expecting to see action and i did.

Permalink",False,"After the first 10 minutes or so of The Marine when John Cena after singlehandedly rescuing three fellow Marines from Al-Queda execution in the best Sly Stallone/Arnold Schwarzenegger fashion and then got himself a discharge for his trouble for disobeying an order, I knew this one was going to be a Thanksgiving treat. As we learned from Clint Eastwood in Heartbreak Ridge, the Marines do value initiative.

Anyway the rest of the film has him unable to adjust to civilian life and then his and wife Kelly Carlson's path cross that of a gang of murderous crooks at a filling station who take Carlson hostage. Bad mistake guys. If you are a fan of the Schwarzenegger/Stallone school of action flicks, you know exactly what the rest of the film is all about.

One bright spot in this film is chief villain Robert Patrick's performance. He is well aware of what a clinker this film is and he may cop the award for the most over the top, outrageously overacted performance of 2006.

And of course all the explosive pyrotechnics are nicely done as well.

Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation and a man who has no sense of embarrassment as he proves time and again produced The Marine. John Cena of course had to lose the WWE title to get several weeks off to film this thing.

It may lead to a career in action films. Cena's got the body of a young Governator and no German accent either."

the action picks up rite away not to give away too much but it starts out as john triton is in iraq saving 3 marines from an al queda execution without waiting for backup and gets discharged from the navy. Then a lot of action picks up rite away after.

Permalink",False,"The other day, I heard a clichéd but semi-truthful joke from Jeff Foxworthy about couples going to the movies. Women want romance and a story. Men want car crashes and full frontal nudity.

Let me the first to tell you that this movie has romance but nearly no story. Also, there are only a few car crashes but where the movie lacks in that, it makes up for tons of explosions. But no nudity. (Sorry to disappoint you guys, but I'm a story guy myself.)

This movie is basically the most clichéd action movie in the world. A big muscular guy who blows up crap and kicks a lot of butt and has to save the damsel in distress. But if a person could set down the clichés, this movie isn't half bad. It is by no means a ""great"" movie, but it is by far the most enjoyable movie I have seen in the past few years. It'll keep you entertained until the very end. Fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat, and powerful. It made me feel like joining the Marines. (If it doesn't make you feel like that, let me know.)

If you want a movie with romance and a story, not for you. If you want a movie with car crashes and full frontal nudity... still not really for you. But if you just want to see a movie where there's just mindless but awesome explosions and intense fight scenes, I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed. Definitely worth the ten bucks. 8/10."

Permalink",True,"first of all im not a big fan of john cena, and i had no intentions of seeing this movie. After watching the trailer, seeing some of the action sequences it kinda caught my eye. Some of the scenes looked action-packed compared to 'the rock' movie THE RUNDOWN, those scenes were amazing. But this movie was gaaaaaaaaaaarbage! Throw this stuff in the trash, bad acting, bad dialogue, the movie was meant for kids! As if was toward the wrestling auidience, i knew this movie was going downhill from the opening scene when john cena saved the P.O.W. and said ""Are you ready to go home?"" with a smile. Lines kept getting cheesy especially the black criminal 'morgan' who wrote his script? this was a big disappointment! Once watched never again!!

Permalink",False,"I went and saw this movie with my boyfriend yesterday night. I personally like John Cena, but the movie itself really isn't that great. On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being great I would rate the acting a 2. The movie really has no flow at all, pretty much explosions and then corny humor followed by more explosions. The preview is pretty much the whole movie. I have to say that I did appreciate the fact that the movie didn't drag on like I was predicting it to. It pretty much got the story across and ended, which was a nice surprise. Obviously the movie is unrealistic with John Cena's character taking enough abuse to kill 100 normal people. I pretty much got what I expected. If you like big fire balls you will love this movie..plus John doesn't look too bad either.

Permalink",False,"I'm beginning to think that WWE Films was a bad idea. My girlfriend and I went to go see The Marine earlier tonight, and now I can't defend wrestling as being a legit form of entertainment anymore. I thought before I went to see this movie that it would be a plot that was thrown together and that there would be a lot of senseless explosions and fight scenes, but I was ready to have myself proved wrong. When I'm right I'm right. Cena is a great athlete, and works a great promo in the ring... but he's not an actor. The plot was so ridiculous that it made Freddy Got Fingered look like The Godfather. And why were there so many explosions? How many buildings blow up before we realize that ""yes, this must be an action film."" I love action flicks as much as the next guy, but there has to be something more than just fist fights and fire... or maybe you can get by on just fist fights and fire, but The Marine didn't pull it off. I give The Marine and E for effort because the action was cool, and the fight scenes were OK. But, the plot was more than lame and predictable, and the acting was not great. I've been a wrestling fan since I was 9, and now I'm insisting that wrestlers , with the exception of the Rock- who has impressed me as an actor, should leave their talent in the ring."

Permalink",False,"What makes this a great action movie is that it's so over the top, but acts like it's the most natural thing in the world. John Cena's acting isn't going to win him anything more than higher WWE ratings, but he out dives more than enough explosions to make up for it. The crew of villains, led by Robert Patrick, is the most inept group of thieves ever assembled, but what makes them great is their never-ending arsenal of over the top weaponry. I haven't seen bigger and badder guns used on cops in a city street since Heat. First time director John Bonito does a great job of maintaining seriousness in a film with an exceptionally hokey script. I'd love to see what he could do with something like Final Destination 4. When you boil it down, Snakes on a Plane wishes it was half as good as The Marine.

I just hope people will go see it instead of the grudge or the guardian because it was well worth what I paid for admission. I am going to go see it again and again. This is way more superb that See No Evil by Kane because it makes more sense. This is about how are USMC is and he shows everyone what it is all about to be a Marine I now have much more respect for the USMC.

Permalink",False,"I rarely care enough to write about a movie but this was the worst, plot-less, poorly acted, nonsensical, illogical insult to the film industry (and to the laws of physics; but I've long since learned to deal with that due to the rest of Hollywood's movies) I've ever seen.

As I mentioned; the plot (if you can call it that) was barely existent and was ridiculously childish at best. The fact that Rome's plans kept changing and becoming increasingly unjustifiable and more stupid as the movie progressed annoyed me (along with his unbelievable persistence to keep the wife alive despite her being the most detrimental thing to their plans since their moronic conception).

I won't reveal anything but the ending was ludicrous to the point of hilarity, however I fear the writers intended us to accept it seriously (though it makes the fact that John Cena jumps (or unrealistically throws someone into) almost every prop imaginable seem almost plausible).

The only reason I watched this movie in its entirety was because I wanted to see Robert Patrick play out this bad guy and I had already paid the 50c to rent the movie (in hindsight; not worth it). The sole not-unbearable aspect of the movie was the one ""Terminator"" reference that Robert Patrick responds to.

Perhaps it is my disappointment tending towards hostility that causes me to give this movie a (probably unfair) 1 due to not only the waste of 93 minutes of my life but also the strain of my eyes caused by the multitude of fake explosions, but if I can save another human being from my fate then the 93 minutes of movie watching and 10 minutes of review writing will be well worth it."

I am a big fan of WWE but it's not because your favorite superstar (wich he is not) participates in a movie that the movie is great!!? John Cena is a bad actor, hopefully they realize that in Hollywood so that there won't make a sequel. The director wants to present him as a superhero but when I saw him for the first time in the movie I had to laugh... I really had trouble watching the movie until the end; So boring, so predictable, so...........lame

I've seen all three movies from WWE films and none of them are good. WWE should stop embarrassing themselves by making bad movies and start improving it's own shows instead.

When it ends in a shootout with some cops. They escape with Kate as a hostage. John must use his marine training to save her, but will he before it's too late. Robert Patrick steals the movie, playing the bad guy in a sadistic but humorous way. It also had great action as well. Like I said this movie is meant to be a good time, nothing else.

They got the point across without doing that. I'm sure a lot of Mr. Cena's fans are younger and I'm sure they enjoyed the movie.

Diamond thief Robert Patrick and his crew kidnap Cena's wife, which leads to the recently discharged marine chasing after Patrick and company through the backwoods of South Carolina. The action is competently produced and Cena is a decent enough of actor in a retro 80s musclebound action hero sort of way (i.e Stallone, Arnold, JCVD, etc.), which is a low bar, but as with those action heroes, he does have undeniable charisma, which he surely honed in the squared circle of the WWE. Overall, ""The Marine"" is nothing to go out of your way to see, but if you're in the mood for something that seems like a more bombastic version of ""Walking Tall"" it's not all that bad.

Permalink",False,"The Marine was one of the first films to be solely produced by WWE Studios, and it features one of the WWE's biggest stars John Cena. In an effort to cash-in on Cena's popularity, they decided to have him attempt to act in a loud, obnoxious, silly action film. The result is likely just about what you'd expect.

Cena plays John Triton, a Marine, who begins the film on a mission. Ignoring a direct order to hold back, Triton rushes head-first into a combat zone, and frees prisoners who were about to be executed. His reward is a swift discharge from the Marine Corps. Not being able to cope with his home-life, he and his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson, ""Nip/Tuck"") decide to pack their things and leave. Where do they want to go? It doesn't matter.

His wife is quickly captured while John is inside of a gas station. She waits in the car, and as criminals pull up, led by a man named Rome (Robert Patrick, T-1000 in ""Terminator 2"", but powerless), a police car also pulls up. The criminals feel threatened, and they disable the officers inside, and steal John's girl. They also blow up the gas station for good measure, but John manages to survive the explosion and begin chasing them.

This is what the rest of the film consists of: explosions and chase sequences. John is now a man on a mission, as he loves his wife, and will stop at nothing to rescue her. He survives countless encounters with the criminals, and doesn't sustain any serious damage at any point of the film. This ends up being one of the film's many problems.

Action films don't exactly have a history of being anywhere close to realistic, and The Marine is no exception. One of the things that separates, say, Die Hard, from The Marine, is the way their heroes actually feel the effects of the action scenes they are in. If John McClane is thrown to the ground, or punched in the face, he feels is. Conversely, John Triton doesn't seem to feel anything. Even an explosion, set off almost directly beside him, doesn't faze him. He's seemingly impervious to any real damage, and it makes it really hard to make it empathize with him.

The other problem the film has is in its hand-to-hand combat scenes. They use a fast-cut type of editing, meaning that with every punch, the camera shifts or shakes. You don't get to see much of the actual fisticuffs, and this seems odd for a film starring a professional wrestler. If there's one thing Cena should be able to do--as he certainly isn't a good actor--it should be that he can fight, or at least fake it. He's used to throwing punches at people, and this type of editing is completely unnecessary, unless of course the fight scenes looked terrible without it.

If nothing else, at least ""The Marine"" can say it doesn't take itself too seriously. Or, at least, its secondary cast doesn't. John Cena thinks this is the most serious project ever made, and is determined to keep a serious face throughout the film. The other actors, the ones who are actually film actors, all seemed to know what the film was--a joke made to quickly make money off John Cena's success.

Even the dialogue of the film makes it seem like it is trying to be as silly as possible. In the opening scene, after Cena rescues a trapped soldier, they come across a group of terrorists. The soldier asks John how they are going to get around the terrorists. John replies with the incredibly predictable and cheesy, ""We don't. We go through them."" There are many more moments in the film like this, where, even if you haven't seen the film, you will be able to predict the next line of dialogue. It's like it was all written as quickly as possible, with the writers attempting to see how many hilarious lines they could get away with.

Unfortunately, The Marine doesn't quite venture into the ""so bad it's good"" territory. That was the only hope it had at being a watchable film, and it didn't quite make it that far. It comes close, and seemingly made a valiant effort, but it just wasn't quite bad enough to be a riot while watching it. You can't laugh at all of it, largely because of how serious Cena plays his role, and it loses a lot of its potential fun at this point.

For a film that's sole purpose was to give wrestling fans a 90 minute film of John Cena blowing things up, I suppose that The Marine served its purpose. As a film, taken out of that context, it is quite bad. The plot is simplified, the acting is poor and the action scenes are not all that well-made. Hardcore John Cena fans are the target audience, and they're also the only ones (open-minded viewers, I think) that are likely to get entertainment from ""The Marine"". And even then, I'm not so sure.

P.S.: How this movie scored over a 4% is beyond me."

Permalink",True,"I knew this was an action movie, it is made by WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) Studios, hence the leading actor being a professional wrestler, this movie has spawned a series of sequels, but this is obviously the most successful, I was just hoping for easy entertainment. Basically John Triton (John Cena) of the United States Marine Corps, returns home from Iraq, he loses his job working as a security guard for using excessive force, so he and his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) decide to take a vacation. Meanwhile a robbery takes place in a jewellery store, led by criminal Rome (Robert Patrick), with his gang: girlfriend Angela (Abigail Bianca), Morgan (Anthony Ray Parker), Vescera (Damon Gibson), and Bennett (Manu Bennett). On the run, the gang stop at a gas station, where Triton and Kate have stopped, two cops arrive for gas, Morgan shoots and kills one of the officers, causing Rome to shoot the other officer, while Angela kills the gas station attendant. The gang take Kate hostage as a precaution, and then blow up the station, Triton regains consciousness and gives chase in the police car, the gang shoot at the car and slowly take it apart in the pursuit, until they reach a lake, Triton falls out of the vehicle and seemingly to his death. Rome and his gang walk through a swamp to avoid the police, Kate tries to escape several times, Detective Van Buren (Jerome Ehlers) is pursuing the gang, he finds Triton who survived and refuses to allow him to pursue the gang, but Triton heads into the swamp anyway. Morgan and Vescera have an altercation, Rome decides to kill Vescera, then he receives a call from the anonymous buyer he was planning to share the profits of the stolen diamonds, but Rome tells him that he intends to cut him out of the deal. The gang find an abandoned lodge and decide to rest there, meanwhile Triton is kidnapped by two fugitives who believe he is a cop looking for them, but he is able to subdue them and continue his search for the gang. Triton finds the lodge, and kills Morgan and Bennett, dragging their bodies underneath the lodge, there he again meets Van Buren, then Kate rushes out attempting another escape, before being attacked and recaptured by Angela. Triton enters the lodge and face-to-face with Rome, Van Buren enters the room, but points his gun, revealing he is the anonymous partner, Triton grabs Van Buren and uses him as a human shield when Rome fires, killing him. Rome makes his escape with Angela and hostage Kate, before firing at a gasoline tank and blowing up the lodge, Triton makes a narrow escape, the explosion launches into the swamp. Rome takes Van Buren, but abandons it due to a police tracking device, Angela seduces a driver then kills him for his truck, Triton is arrested by a marine patrol officer, but is able to steal his handcuffs and vessel, he races to the marina. Jumping on the truck, Triton grabs Angela and throws her out to crash through the windshield of an oncoming bus, killing her and spilling the diamonds, Rome tries to get rid of Triton, driving into passing buildings, and leaps out before the truck careens through a warehouse, then crashes into a lake. Triton stumbles out, leaving Rome in the fiery warehouse, Kate is handcuffed in the truck and drowns, but Triton manages to revive her, a badly-burned Rome returns and tries to choke Triton with a chain, but finally Triton kills him breaking his neck, it ends with Triton and Kate kissing as the police approach. Also starring Drew Powell as Joe and Frank Carlopio as Frank. Cena fails to contend with the likes of Schwarzenegger or Stallone, and even fellow grappler Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, and exhibits preposterous god-like indestructibility, surviving three or four huge explosions and crashing through things, Patrick does alright as the main baddie, and doesn't mind poking fun at his T-1000 fame or being part of the unstoppable goodie joke. It is a pretty basic plot, the wife of the good guy is kidnapped and will do whatever it takes to get her back and stop the trigger-happy diamond thieves, the script is full of clichés, silly banter and predictability, and obviously you cannot take it seriously, but there is a small part of you enjoying yourself, laughing at how ridiculous it is, and the the speedy chase sequences and things blowing up, a dumb but watchable enough action. Okay!

He's a horrible wrestler, he's atrocious on the mic and he gets handed everything he wants. So how can you expect something good to come from a piece of garbage like him.

Permalink",True,"John Cena is portrayed as some next up terminator in this film. Back then it was WWE's way of portraying Cena as a superhero (even nowadays).

The first scene of the film, Cena is in Iraq where he is a one man army against the Taliban.

There's a part where this guy survives an explosion in the gas station scene. I'm wondering how is he still alive from this as there are hardly any scars or marks on him as well as him getting up so quickly.

Another scene was him in a police car as his wife is kidnapped by these bank robbers so he chases after them. Two of the bank robbers fire at him, but they can't manage to hit this guy. They only shoot the police car's. The car soon begins to go up in flames and then Cena jumps out for the car to then explode. This makes Cena land in the river.

Next, Cena battles the robbers again and they manage to escape some next up house. One of the guys shoot a gas pipe for it to then explode the whole house. Guess what, ""Super Cena survives that by jumping out with another huge explosion.

After, Cena jumps onto a truck for where his wife is on, then gets hit by a bunch of wooden houses. SO UNREALISTIC.

The summary is that ""Super Cena"" is not a superhero in this film and he'll never be an action film legend.

Permalink",True,"What could have been a good cheesy B-movie in the vein of COMMANDO turns out to be an absolutely awful, devastatingly bad attempt at making an action film by people who clearly haven't got a clue about the genre. It's a brain-dead effort chronicling the 'adventures' of an ex-marine, trying to bust the bad guys who have kidnapped his wife. A simple plot, and an excuse for lots of action you might think. Well, you'd be wrong. In fact there isn't much action in a film that is instead so badly written that my dog could have done better. Imagine playground dialogue, preposterous situations, and a total disregard for the laws of physics and you have THE MARINE, an all-new low in cinema.

The saddest thing is that this film has had quite a budget spent on it. More than, say, something like Seagal's latest straight-to-DVD release. It's backed by WWE films, who I imagine won't be financing any more productions, and the target demographic appears to be black American teenagers, as the film is chock full of lame racial humour and bizarre music that doesn't really fit in. As the hero, John Cena is wooden beyond belief, offering no empathy into his character, no reason to back him or support him in his actions. He's a typical muscle man without a brain, all brawn and no acting skills. Opposite Cena is an actor who used to be good, before his career took a nose dive into the kind of B-movie pap that fills the shelves these days: it's none other than Robert Patrick, complete with a TERMINATOR in-joke at his expense. While Cena underacts, Patrick totally overdoes it, and he's never anything other than laughable. The rest of the cast are also pretty lame, especially Parker as comic relief and Carlson as the token blonde bimbo.

Don't get me wrong, I love B-movie action films but this one really takes the biscuit. The only halfway decent moment is a car chase about halfway through that's totally overblown but nevertheless quite enjoyable. That's about all the action the film offers, and if watching a guy running through the swamps endlessly seems like your idea of fun, then go ahead and check this out. The set-piece in the wooden shack is badly handled and the laughable climax so, well, laughable that even the entertainment value suffers. Of course they can't resist one more cheesy back-from-the-dead shock but I was in no mood for forgiveness by the time this arose. The fight scenes are poorly handled, cutting away from the hits and without any skill on the parts of the actors. This is really bad stuff, terrible in fact, with only a couple of decent explosions to recommend it. C-grade trash...

Permalink",False,"I used to really like this movie. However, the years have gone by and my tastes have matured, and I must say, this defines the word ""overblown."" It's not half-bad as a popcorn flick as long as you turn your brain COMPLETELY off.

I really like John Cena the wrestler, but as an actor (at least in this movie), he isn't anything too special. He's rather wooden and his character is unengaging.

The villains kind of suck. Robert Patrick 15 years earlier played one of the greatest movie villains ever in the T-1000, but here his villain is pretty generic. His henchmen and woman are very one-dimensional.

The action scenes can be fun to watch if you are able to get past the fact that they are completely implausible and are borrowed from many other movies. Cena's character is just mostly a Superman figure, which usually isn't a good thing.

The story is simplistic and the script has some genuinely cringe-worthy one-liners (I did like that Terminator reference, though!).

As a movie, it isn't offensively bad or unwatchable by any means, but still pretty bad. Look at it as nothing more than escapism. If you really want to see this, don't do any deep thinking while watching it.

RATING: C-"

Permalink",True,"The Marine (2006): Dir: John Borito / Cast: John Cena, Robert Patrick, Kelly Carlson, Anthony Ray Parker, Abigail Bianca: Stupid action farce about unstoppable power. In this case wrestler John Cena plays a discharged Marine whose wife is kidnapped by criminals in the heat of a shootout . Diamonds were stolen and the trigger happy villains go about making their getaway even less possible. That pretty much sums it up and it resembles countless other action films that are either as bad or worse than this one. Director John Borito does his best using slow motion action and lots of explosions yet nothing remarkable happens. To be fair, Cena has prospects as an action star but his role here is typical search and destroy plus revenge, which will not help him standout in a crowd of other action star wannabees. Robert Patrick has fun as the head villain but his role is hardly interesting. Kelly Carlson as Cena's kidnapped wife is lifeless. She is reduced to a damsel who is slapped around and dragged through a swamp. Other roles are the faceless characters meant to be seen and forgotten soon after. The basic point of this tired charade is to showcase Cena as an action star but in a better script he may possibly excel. This formula has been done to death and even adding Cena cannot add interest. At any rate, he fares better than Kane did in See No Evil. Score: 2 / 10

Permalink",False,"Well since the late 1980s several wrestling stars have taken to the big screen with variable success. Dwayne Johnson seems to be standout actor from a roll call that includes Roddy Piper and Steve Borden amongst others.

WWE has started their own film division in order to promote some of its bigger wrestling stars hence here we have John Cena playing an ex-marine going after a group of trigger happy diamond thieves who are on the run and have kidnapped his wife.

Its never explained why the thieves happen to kill police and other members of the public when they should be keeping a low profile. As always the gang tends to bicker among themselves, one of them even shoots the other for unfathomable reasons.

Cena is in hot pursuit of the bad guys and nothing seems to stop him, he really is like the terminator which also happens to be the best joke made in the film in the presence of Robert (T-1000) Patrick.

Given the fact that Cena has all the presence and acting ability of a tree trunk its only left to the bad guys to inject some zest to the film. Patrick adds some humour here and there and Anthony Ray Parker gives a surreal explanation why he does not like rock candy.

The film has some big explosions which are very well done, there are some good action scenes which I expect Cena to excel at but he brings actually no personality to the film. As this is a dumb old action film you would want the star to have some charisma to carry the film and Cena is totally outside his comfort zone."

Permalink",True,"Ex-Marine John Triton, finding trouble fitting into civilian life, gets dragged into chasing a bunch of crooks when his wife is kidnapped.

I know nothing about WWF wrestling, but I gather John Cena, who plays Triton, is one of its exponents, and the movie success of Dwayne Johnson, also a wrestler in a previous life, may explain the existence of The Marine as a vehicle for Cena. There's only one problem: Johnson can act, Cena can't.

And not only can't he act, he fails to do so in a film which would have required acting of Oscar-winning standards to overcome the ridiculous script - in one car chase, a car he is driving is peppered with machine gun fire (as evidenced by the bullet strikes all over the bonnet, sides and roof) without a tyre being hit or, more importantly, Cena himself given that he is driving having knocked out the windshield. Mind you, let's be fair, he's holding up a bulletproof vest in one arm to protect himself (of course, this means he can't see where he's going, but let's overlook that).

Robert Patrick is the main villain and looks as if he's having fun chewing scenery. Kelly Carlson is Triton's wife and looks like a young Sharon Stone. There is no other reason for watching this film.

Permalink",False,"I enjoyed this movie, as it was a parody and a comedy in disguise for me. I was absolutely in stitches with some of the dialogue, such as when he explains that marines don't go around people, they go through them? Plus there is a great bit where they are walking through the woods and a couple of characters start talking about there experiences at a scout camp. I was in stitches at that strange moment, as the filmmakers were obviously having a laugh. I like this movie as it is clearly a tongue in cheek parody of ex-soldier/special forces etc. action movies. I've watched it twice now, which I know is sad, but the movie makes me laugh every time. There are many scenes that made me cringe and squirm in my seat and reach for the stop button on my remote controller, but I couldn't bring myself to stop the magnificent avalanche of corniness from this movie. If you are after a realistic action movie, then you'll be disappointed, but if you are fed up of ex-GI, ex-CIA, ex-marine, ex-special forces, ex- parking attendant or ex-SAS types of movies, then you'll love it, as they really ham it up for you with all the cheesiness they can muster to cause you to put your head in your hands and ask yourself why you can't just turn it off. It's so bad that it is in a category that few other movies fall into - the same category as Glen or Glenda or Battlefield Earth is in - as in it's that cheesy and weird that you can't stop watching it. A cult movie."

Permalink",True,"At first I thought it might be a live-action movie, then I realized it was all a very realistically done cartoon.

It's just plan terrible. It includes nothing you haven't seen a dozen or more times before. John Cena is a tall muscle man, all splanchnocranium and bulging biceps. He's taut but not graceful. It reminds me of an observation an anthropologist, Alice Brues, made of the gorilla: ""He can kill anything he can catch but he can't catch anything."" He and the other characters do a fairly decent job of acting, considering that they are nothing more than computer-generated images and their speech is digitally fabricated.

The direction is worse. It belong back in the 1960s when seeing action filmed in slow motion was a novelty instead of a hoary cliché. Among the things you've seen before is the pursuit at high speed, several exploding fireballs, a room peppered with bullets, one bad guy shooting another because there may be the hint of betrayal, the good guy tied up and beaten, and -- well, everything. There is wit in some of the lines. It's as if the writers were dying to break out of this action flick straightjacket and write the comedy that the movie really is.

The award for best performance and best lines goes to -- envelope, please -- Robert Patrick as the smooth, butyraceous leader of the greasy pack. He's always carefully dressed and polite. Oh, he knows his way around.

The plot: the gang kidnaps Cena's wife. He pursues them and gets her back. That's more than the plot deserves.

Permalink",False,"""WWE productions"" might have been a dead giveaway, but ""The Marine"" is a brainless, loud action flick padded with stuff blowing up. The plot concerns an ex-marine named John (John Cena) who has been discharged for disobeying orders. John has trouble readjusting to normal life, seeing as he's got an unspoken urge to kill or blow something up every 24 hours. When a group of jewel thieves, headed by Rome (Robert Patrick) steal John's van and take his wife Kate (Kelly Clarkson) hostage they will soon find out that they messed with the wrong man. John just happened to bring along his deadliest weapon: himself! (That's a line from the back of the DVD cover but it's so ridiculous I had to include it).

You can enjoy ""The Marine"" as an action movie because to be frank, it's so over-the-top and ridiculous it becomes kind of fun. The characters are absurd and badly written, the action is so insane it would make some action stars from the 80's blush and the acting is pretty lackluster. When it comes to our hero, he's pretty much just a block of wood that walks around showing off his awesome marine skills and killing bad guys. Aside from the fact that he doesn't like to be messed with, loves his wife and that serving in the army meant everything to him, you don't know anything about the guy. With a central character like this you'd expect to be bored out of your skull, but that's when the villains come in.

The bad guys are made to be over-the-top slimy and it's glorious. Rome is the leader of the group and the guy's a complete lunatic. He's the kind of person that will kill his own minions on a whim, feels no remorse about murdering innocent civilians and to be extra evil, will betray anyone if need be. He employs the nuttiest minions on his heist. We've got the sexy female girlfriend who's just as ruthless as he is. She's in the movie for some cheap titillation and to have a cat fight with Kelly Clarkson (inexplicably, no nudity in this Unrated film). The rest are just generic mooks with a big target on their chests that are begging for our hero to kill them. The one exception is Morgan (Anthony Ray Parker), the mad dog who screws up every single mission because he just loves killing people and blowing stuff up.

What works with the movie, sometimes unintentionally are the action sequences. There are some pretty cool sequences where John murders the forces of evil one by one by blowing them up, choking them, shooting them or even throwing them at moving vehicles. This movie also helps you stay invested by having a massive explosion every 15 minutes or so. Yeah that means our hero is constantly jumping out of windows and narrowly evading huge fireballs, but he also takes a sledgehammer to the ribcage without wincing too much so just assume he's some sort of Terminator at this point. As a ""So Bad it's good movie"" you can make plenty of jokes at the actors' expense, poking fun at the plot and such. What prevents it from pure ""bad"" gold is the horrendous comedy. Most of it revolves around Morgan and his stupid dueling banjo moments and references to ""Deliverance"", but there was one joke I have to bring to your attention. The setup is that John is chasing the bad guys in what is clearly not a police car because it's some kind of sports car painted black and white with signal lights at the top and it is being hit by hundreds of rounds of ammo. The car's roof gets ripped clean off and to protect himself, John picks up a bullet-proof vest and holds it up in the air as a shield. The villains are just as baffled as the audience. That makes no sense; you can't do that! One of the criminals yells ""What is this guy?! The Terminator?"" Then the camera zooms in on Robert Patrick and he gives the camera a look like ""Yes you're right... that was me in 1991"". It's a bad joke that left me with many questions. So in this Marine universe, there's a movie called ""Terminator"" and from the characters' delivery of that line, it sounds like it's the same movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger that we know. Does that mean that in this universe there's a sequel where the T-1000 is played by a guy who just happens to look incredibly similar to Roman? Do people go up to him and ask for his autograph all the time because they confuse the two? Could it be that in this universe, actor Robert Patrick turned out to be some kind of sociopath and after that movie moved on to a life of crime and changed his name? I know it's just a stupid joke, but this plot is so bland and predictable that it pulled me right out of the experience.

Even for a movie starring a pro-wrestler, there's no reason for writing this poor. It's a bad movie but it does redeem itself a bit. Kelly Clarkson is actually pretty good in her role, Robert Patrick has either lost his mind completely or is having fun playing a bad guy, the special effects are good and the action is so out-there that you've never seen anything like the more elaborate action sequences. For those moments, it's fun. For the comedy, lead and story, it's dumb. Here's what you've got to do. Get yourself a bunch of friends, pop this movie into your DVD player and just laugh at the action. Bring some popcorn to throw at the screen when anyone says a bad joke. If you do that, it's a pretty solid ""So Bad it's good"" action movie. (Unrated version on DVD, May 30, 2014)"

Permalink",True,"During the early 2000's, The Rock became the top dog in the WWE to the point that WWE Studios use him to produce films. When the Rock move on from wrestling in late 2004 to start in more Hollywood's films outside of WWE Studios. It left a void that needed to be fill. This is where John Cena comes in. The Marine was supposed to be the first developed solely by the company to reach the filming stage and to show cast its newest wrestling star. 'The Master of The Five Moves of Doom' John Cena got his own movie as John Triton, the Marine, well technically ex-Marine who come home only to have his wife (Kelly Clarkson) kidnapped by a ruthless criminal name Rome (Robert Patrick) during a jewel robbery heist. Now he must rescue the dimstress in disrest. It's a pointless action film and gratuitous action scenes loosely attributed to a half-constructed plot. The absurdity of it only caps off the fun. I personally am a wrestling fan and love to watch wrestlers in action. Still, John Cena is probably the worst portrayal of a Marine in film. Not only does he violating a commander's order during duty, but being a Marine gives up Captain America type superpowers. After jumping head-first and upside-down from a high speed exploding camaro in the mid-air, John Cena will emerge later without any injuries at all. Come on, movie. Plus, I also don't think it lets you be a vigilante legally. ""John Cena, you are charged with theft of law enforcement vehicles and assault. How do you plead?"" ""A Marine, sir."" The way John Cena is able to survive a series of explosion is so unrealistic. You might be asking yourself, I really got burn watching this stupid movie, didn't I? There is an explosion in every action scene. I guess everything is flammable, combustible, or explosive. It doesn't look real, the explosions looks like a well laid out pyrotechnics fireworks display. The villains are just as silly as the hero. Rome loves to shoots cops in sight over dozens of witnesses that would gladly turn him in. His henchmen like to break the fourth wall, and have stupid rape pedophile jokes about a summer camp involving rock candy. Sorry, are we supposed to find that funny? When reliving traumatic memories of suggested sexual abuse and buggery, a few notes of Dueling Banjos will make it funny. As if, movie. John Cena looks out of place in the film, anyways. The big muscles, wooden face with the funny hair cut with limited lines that makes him look like a silly mini slow Terminator bodybuilder than a quick, fast, Marine. Cena is a decent wrestler. It's just his selling and presentation that sucks, much like this movie. The movie seems like a throwback to 80s action movies with all the pointless excessive action scenes that has nothing to do with the film. Trust me, there are some action scenes in the movie that plays no part in the plot line like Triton meeting the redneck or Triton as a security guard. The movie is B Movie ""so bad it's good"" kind of action-flick. If you don't take it serious, it's good fun. Still, the movie is a no brain meathead type of film that would make you wish that it could have rented a better movie out there.

Permalink",True,"I thought that this movie was highly underrated. Cena may not be a box office star, and maybe he's not even in the level of the Rock, but I still thought, for what it was, it was a good performance. The Marine isn't a movie to make you think, it's an action movie. Triton's not a character that's supposed to show every range of emotion, but instead to fight for what he lost. Triton's sole mission was to get his wife back by any means necessary, and instead of whining, complaining, or worrying about the police, he does just that. He followed the antagonists, he fought them, and he beat them. He may have been the cookie cutter ""action guy"" in this movie, but in my own personal opinion it worked. It may not have been the greatest movie in the world, but for an action movie, it kept me interested and I enjoyed it.

Permalink",False,"I had low expectations before watching this film but was somewhat surprised that I enjoyed it. It doesn't have a realistic plot and there are many silly and dumb gags, and the film is unintentionally funny, but its pretty entertaining and a fun adventure.

The plot: John Triton is a heroic Marine who returns home after being discharged --against his will--from the war in Iraq. Stateside, he finds himself back in action, when his wife is kidnapped by a murderous gang at a gas station stop led by the merciless Rome. With everything on the line, the Marine John will stop at nothing to carry out his toughest and most important mission.

The Marine is an action film that offers a lot of explosions, fist fights, gun fights, chase scenes and crude humor (including pedophillia played for laughs). It might have been elevated from a C to a B, had its script, acting and direction had been a bit more sophisticated, but it is a pretty clumsy effort. It probably would have been better had an experienced action director been at the helm, but this was directed by John Bonito, whose previous experience is mainly World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) projects, which makes sense, since the star of the movie is a wrestler, John Cena, and one of the film's production companies is WWE. Many complaints is that the film isn't realistic and cheesy but I don't think thats really a bad thing. The film is meant to be more comedic and it takes itself less serious. Its main target audience is WWE and Cena fans (which are probably younger viewers)so it wasn't that surprising the way the film was. Overall the film wasn't that bad considering its an WWE film."

Permalink",True,"The Marine is an easy watch, with some decent action, and despite what many think in my opinion, a charismatic lead in Cena. It's low budget, but I still had a pretty okay time with it, it's just goofy enough to work. Cena is far from the world's greatest actor, but he's always had a certain charisma to him, and I do actually like the guy a lot, despite the fact that he's champion a bit too much. Robert Patrick is effective as the villain, and I thought the scene where Cena throws the guy through the window when he's working for security, was quite amusing.

Performances. John Cena is definitely charismatic, if not Mr. World's greatest actor. He does enough to lead the film, and I was able to buy into his character. Not Bad Cena, not bad. Robert Patrick knows he's in a low budget film, and makes the most of it. He's fun to watch, and I enjoyed his bantering with Cena. Kelly Carlson is sexy no doubt about that, but is kind of wooden. Her chemistry with Cena seemed natural though.

Bottom line. The Marine is an easy time waster, with some decent action. It's not rocket science, it won't make your day, but it'll give you some OK entertainment if your in the right frame of mind. Worth a rental, heck I bought it cheap on DVD, after I viewed it, eh maybe i'm just easily amused, but I kinda dug it.

Permalink",False,"To my mind, this cheesy and funny piece of action is severely underrated. Watching it for the third time, I'm even considering that seven is a low rating.

The one venerable point in Marine is its humor. It truly doesn't take itself too seriously. The action's taut and crisp all the way from the initial heist up to the absurd final.

Cena's similarity to Arnie Schwarzenegger and obvious and it's put to good use. After all, hunks like these have not been to the Actor's Studio, they're action types with a limited register, but a believable one in this case.

The similarities with Arnold's Commando are obvious. Saving a member of the family, blowing up lots of bad guys, fighting against impossible odds, that's classic 80s stuff. Patrick's performance dots the i's. I like this one!

Permalink",False,"John Cena does his best Ah-nuld impression in this half-baked knockoff of COMMANDO. Cena is an ex-Marine turned security guard whose wife is kidnapped by a bunch of homicidal robbers and taken deep into the swamps of South Carolina. Cena is soon in hot pursuit and no amount of explosions or car crashes or bullets can stop him. He is seemingly invincible. He also gets to fight some of these maniacs man a man, as Cena is a wrestler in real life. Robert Patrick is the leader of the bad guys, and his character never takes the movie seriously, as THE MARINE is basically a comic update of COMMANDO. Funny lines and arched eyebrows abound, especially when one of the bad guys says their pursuer reminds him of the Terminator (Patrick was the bad Terminator in TERMINATOR 2). The best part of this silly, over-the-top and thoroughly unbelievable action film are the many explosions, especially one that takes place at a highway gas station. Cena looks great in the lead, although his idea of acting apparently is a sort-of blank-faced, Mark Wahlberg type of stare. The hammy Patrick easily steals this show. By the way, Cena's hapless wife in this is played by an actress who looks remarkably like Sharon Stone from her TOTAL RECALL period. Coincidence? I wonder. She is definitely sexy.

Permalink",False,"So, I had watched ""12 Rounds"", was impressed by John Cena, and, as promised, went back to pick up his previous ""thriller"",""The Marine"". Again, this movie started out with a bang, and kept them coming. But, there was not as much of Cena, as opposed to a group of thieves, that didn't think twice about killing a cop. ""Morgan"", the one black member of the posse kept me laughing- every time he opened his mouth, it was something funny. There were some puns taken from other movies, that you either got, or you didn't- but I'm not a spoiler. I agree with an earlier user's comment : ""that John Cena has definitely improved his acting skills from ""The Marine"" to ""12 Rounds"""". And considering the fact that he is , first, a wrestler, I have to admit, I was impressed with both attempts (he's no Seagal or Staitham), but he is watchable. I think a lot of his downfall may be the actors surrounding him- I think they hold him back- they are not that great. It would be great to throw Mr. Cena in a movie with an A-list actor, and see how he fares. I think he would hold his own, and be a lot more favorable to other producers/directors/etc.. It was the fast car chases, and many explosions (w/ John always flying through the air), that kept me watching. He DID make the movie, even if it was only a ""6 out 0f 10 star) movie for me. I wish Mr. Cena the best of luck in feature endeavors- he could be a Bruce Willis!"

Permalink",True,"Having never being interested in WWE, it wasn't John Cena that made me buy this on DVD. I saw that Kelly Carlson and Robert Patrick were in the film and that reason, along with the promise of some good decent action, I thought it would be a good film to watch after a night on the town.

I was sorely wrong.

Even after several pints of lager, I couldn't stand Cena's 'acting', the OTT explosions and repetitive nature of the fights. Straight into the film and Cena is rescuing some Marines from the terrorists. I knew, from the 'Hollywood Effect' of the ammunition and the badly choreographed fight scenes, that I was in for a shocker of a night.

Apart from some good lines by Robert Patrick, the film was laughable. Even Kelly Carlson as the eye-candy couldn't raise the film in my eyes. A waste of money.

Permalink",True,"I like military movies, and have wanted to see Cena in film, so borrowed this from a friend.

I found myself laughing in the most absurd places, and at times wondering if it was meant to be comedy/farce, not Action/Drama/Thriller. Seriously, the bad guy interrupts a call from a ""business deal"" and takes that turns out to be about his cable subscription, getting excited?! That is FARCE.

Cheesy doesn't begin to describe the film--it's like snippets of every bad movie ever made (and I swear I hear music from Titanic at one point! /sarcasm).

I'll give Cena a 9 for giving a good performance with a horrible written script. But really, if you just want to stare at Cena, watch wrestling. And if your aim is something a little deeper than that? Well... watch wrestling, because this isn't it!

Permalink",True,"Well, I served in the Marine Corps for 8 years, four of them were in South Carolina. I left with a Rifle Expert 10th Awd, Pistol Expert 4th Awd, Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, Marine Corps Medal, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Defense Meritorious Service, Air Medal, Navy Achievement Medal, and other basic service awards. I also had a car with South Carolina license plate NAH-339 - and then, as now, they only put them on the BACK of a vehicle. This movie was lame, I mean, REALLY lame. Aside from the fact that clearly none of the film ever spent ANY time even close to the South Carolina setting it purported to have, it was unrealistically ludicrous throughout, and almost without merit as decent viewing material. I waited more than one year for my turn to see a copy from my library on DVD. It was definitely NOT worth the wait, but since I saw it without paying, I have no regrets. If you paid to see it, IMHO you did not get your money's worth. When they got the the reference of the terminator, and the bad guy refused to die, I would have just ejected the DVD if I weren't watching the movie with another person who I was embarrassed to have attempted to entertain with it.

Permalink",False,"Upon first viewing I hated this film. All of its cookie cutter characters, lame plot, and some outrageously unbelievable action scenes - such as the hero getting hit in the face with a fire extinguisher full force and then only feeling dizzy for a few seconds. Yet, after catching it on cable a while later there is something appealing that ""The Marine"" has to offer. The plot is still lame and the action just as ridiculous, but the style of the movie is what fans of 80s flicks (a la ""Commando"" which is just as ridiculous as this movie) crave to see.

Today's action movies seem to be shot with ever increasingly spectacular sets and stunt pieces yet then they seem carelessly edited as quickly as possible. Do action film directors finish shooting a movie then load up on Red Bull and espressos right before taking it to the edit suite? It sure seems like it. Even good action movies that come out today, like The Bourne Ultimatum, are sometimes too relentless for their own good. The show loud blurry images of what we can only sometimes assume are fights and explosions. ""The Marine"" is a bad movie, but it is a good bad movie (bear with me, please) in that it captures the action in a very engaging way - SLOW MOTION! For instance, roughly 35 minutes in a gas station goes up in a flames and the many shots of this event show debris being propelled into the air, flames rising and there is a certain grace and eloquence to the sequence that virtually all action movies today lack. Later in the film a punctured propane tank explodes and tears up a house and again - many shots show the mushrooming flames and scattering debris making the explosion - what's the word? - sexy? enjoyable? Maybe both, but words don't matter here. Also it is not all about slow motion, there are many different shot speeds used here, and it the whole lot of them together that makes the action scenes fun.

""The Marine"" is nothing more than an action guilty pleasure for guys who like movies (or pro-military propaganda, but hey, so is Top Gun and that's a classic) but it has something going for it that most of today's action films don't. Let's hope that next time they mix this under-used action style with a good story the way they used to do. --- 5/10

Permalink",True,"If you are looking for a movie that is disappointing on all fronts - be it story, photography, character, sequences, etc. then go and watch the Marine. The movie convinces us beyond doubt that WWE should stick to what is good at - sports entertainment. My sincere request to WWE is to keep its wrestlers in the ring where they are good rather than throw them on stage. Of course, I don't mean to say that those wrestlers cannot act but I do mean it when I say that WWE cannot make movies and should stick to what is good at.

The Marine is one of the worst movies I have ever come across. And needless to say, I had expected that to happen since it was WWE which had come up with the movie in the first place. The movie is a plot borrowed from Commando. In that movie, Arnold's daughter is kidnapped and in this movie, John Cena's wife is kidnapped. While there is something to look at in Commando since Arnold is indeed believable as a soldier, there is nothing interesting happening in The Marine. John Cena fails to convince us that he is a marine and the movie overall fails to convince us why it was ever made.

The bombs and guns are nothing intelligent nor realistic. The punches are worst. I agree that when the train is coming towards you, if you are moving towards the train, then the train appears to move faster towards you. Maybe this is what the photographer had in mind when he moved the camera around randomly never allowing us to see a single punch land where it was meant to land. Yes, the punches start and they never end. We never get to see one complete punch start and land at its place demonstrating some realism. Instead we get to see the end result of the target fall down.

None of the fight sequences or other action sequences are well done. There is not one scene in the movie, not one dialog that can leave a lasting impact on you. None! When I watch an action movie, I set my mind in a mode wherein I stop analyzing for plot loop holes and look for action since that is what the movie is about. But in spite of doing this, I could not find anything enjoyable in the movie and it was in fact one of those movies that made me feel that I had wasted my time by even trying to watch the movie once.

Plenty of pointless and over the top shootings, fights and explosions. Everybody (except Robert Patrick) roided up to the extreme, all girls barby dolls. The predictable comeback of the bad guy in the final fight. Some basic and irrelevant attempts at personality are made. A psychotic leader, a hillbilly, a trigger-happy black man, a femme fatale, and a loyal henchman. Our hero is the typical army dude unable to integrate in real life. All done with a flair of amusement. Basically, an unintelligent yet slightly entertaining movie, tailored to the WWE fan.

Permalink",False,"This movie is pretty good. OK, so the acting ain't great but what action movie is noted for its spectacular acting? None. So don't beat yourself up about some cheesy dialogue. We used to love Arnie's cheesy dialogue in the 80's so what's the difference these days? John Cena is no Al Pacino but doesn't try to be... What he is though, like Arnie, is a bodybuilder-like bad-ass who just will not quit despite being shot at and blown up in every scene he's involved in! He will not stop until he has rescued his wife from evil kidnappers. Does this sound familiar? Of course it does because its written like every Arnie or Stallone action movie we loved in the 80's! This is a modern day version of 1985's Commando! The bad guys are led by the awesome Robert Patrick (another link to Arnie), and try to escape across the country with Cena's insanely hot wife (played by Kelly Carlson). This is just simply great cheesy fun, an old school popcorn movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and has explosions and action galore. Really enjoyable.

Permalink",False,"My Take: Vile and violent, there's really not much fun in this cheesy and ridiculous actioner.

For the record, I have nothing against brainless summer action fare. Take it from this guy who loved AIR FORCE ONE to recommend a little THE ROCK, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE or INDEPENDENCE DAY. There's also the brand of summer action pictures like FIRST BLOOD and COMMANDO, and that's the 80's action genre, consist of slam-bang violence and cheesy dramatic side emotions. In watching films like this, I only look at the slam-bang violence and leave the dramatic blah to itself. But it's all too much in wrestler John Cena's THE MARINE, which not only embraces the cheesiness of an 80's action thriller, but basically is cheesy itself. With its nauseating action, implausible stunts, banal acting, terrible script and a total lack of a real point, THE MARINE is a bloated but utterly joyless hunk of overcooked cheese that isn't at all fun as it might (and should) have been. Somewhere out there, Seagal and Van Damme have a hope for a career pursuit.

Cena plays discharged marine John Triton (following the legacy of John-named action heroes) who goes on his own (as always) as a one-man army when his wife (Kelly Carlson) is kidnapped by thugs led by sly baddie Rome (Robert Patrick) when they stop over for gas during a road trip. What follows is basically everything the likes of COMMANDO are made of. Violence, chases and more violence, THE MARINE tries to outdo the rest the way other films do it: More! The violence is taken to the extremes (though still manages to keep the PG-13 writing) to the point of implausible. That would have been no problem at all if the film were a lot of fun. Alas, it really isn't. The stunts, while fast and explosive, is never really exhilarating or exciting. Moments that should put me on the edge-of-my-seat were more formulaic than exciting.

Most of all, besides the lame action, is its lack of a more reliable action hero. Even with his best attempts, Cena just has yet to make a move as an actor to be able to be a more believable action hero. While he's surely flair when it comes to doing his stunts, he's extremely weak an actor to be appropriate for the film's ""dramatic"" sequences, which weren't supposed to be there in the first place. The villain is much better than the hero, but it seems that Robert Patrick was yet to get over the mechanical personality of his T-1000 character in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. He's baddie is a little bit to dry. And don't get me started on the supporting players! If what you've come to expect from THE MARINE is mindless action, and nothing more stands in your way, then here's a reason to see the film. If you want to be blown out of your seat, resist to believe even the film's poster. This is not that film.

Permalink",True,"I am a huge professional wrestling fan, and usually have a mild interest in seeing a movie featuring somebody in wrestling, depending on the type of movie it is. I have seen many movies where wrestling stars have been in minor, supporting roles to major roles. I wanted to see this one when it was in theaters, but something stopped me when the reviews began coming in, and the WWE spin doctors kept touting its fair success (debuting at #3 in the US) when the movie's star, John Cena was in the ring.

The WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) heavily promoted ""The Marine"" as the movie was about to be released by their then new motion picture division, WWE Films (recently renamed WWE Studios). They gave us behind-the-scenes segments on all their TV programming. Then, when the movie came out, the movie's star would come to the ring wearing a military-style cap, and would salute as he entered the arena. To explain his absence while filming the movie, the WWE explained that Cena was attacked by another WWE star at a club after one of the shows.

What this movie re-enforces is that Vince McMahon, the chairman of the WWE and co-producer of this film, should stick to professional wrestling (which he renamed ""sports-entertainment"" in the 1990's). He has tried branching out into other forms of entertainment with things like the World Bodybuilding Federation and the NBC-backed XFL professional football league, and they failed.

However, despite getting bad reviews and peaking at #3 at the US Box Office, a sequel is reportedly in the works.

""John Triton"" (Cena) loved being a US Marine. After a big mistake in Iraq during a mission to save some fellow soldiers, he is dishonorably discharged. Now, he's back home, living with his beautiful wife, ""Kate"" (Kelly Carlson) and working as security in a high-rise in an unnamed city (Queensland, Australia in reality) until he loses that job when a TV crew films an incident resulting him throwing a jilted lover of one of the building's employees out of the building -- through a window.

Some time later, the ""Tritons"" are on a road trip and stop for gas. What they don't know is that a group of diamond thieves are also in the gas station/convenience store, who robbed a bank the other day. When one of the thieves kills a cop who stopped for gas, they jump into the ""Triton's"" car and take ""Kate"" with them.

Now, the former ""Marine"" goes after those who took his wife.

The first thing you notice in this movie is that the actors are given uneven dialogue. Throughout the entire movie, the cast has some weakly written dialogue that sometimes makes you wonder if the person who wrote it knew what they were doing. There was just way too much bad lines in this movie if you ask me.

Despite the bad lines, there is some pretty good performances in this film. One that certainly stands out is that of Cena, who makes his acting debut in this film. I found him very comfortable delivering his lines and he had some pretty good chemistry with just about everybody he was on screen with. I liked the chemistry between him and Carlson, and wish that they had more scenes together to develop their on-screen relationship more before the kidnapping. I also liked lead villain, ""Rome"" (Robert Patrick), but his character wasn't well written like the rest of the cast of characters In fact this movie has poor character development all around. We get that the villains are, until a certain point in the movie, working for somebody who contacts them via cell phone. But, we never get their or their employer's motive as to why they want the diamonds. You also get ""John's"" co-worker who was barely used as comedic relief.

Even the hand-to-hand fight scenes were not done well. In one scene, ""John"" gets smashed over the head with something that would have knocked out any other action star to allow the villains to get away for the time being, but he just shrugs it off. In another scene, and I have seen this in other movies featuring professional wrestlers who are involved in a movie fight, he takes out an opponent with a move used in wrestling.

Visually, this movie is pretty bland. They barely use the scenery, except for establishing shots. We also get basic day and night shots with no flash.

The action is also poorly handled in this movie. I found the action sequences too short to be interesting. Yes, we get some fair gun play, with little to no blood, and one really impressive explosion in the film. I just found these sequences poorly edited together and not interesting.

The people behind the movie obviously didn't do their homework while this movie was still in development. For example, look at the hat ""John"" wears when he is given his discharge orders. It's a US Army hat. A Marine would not be issued another military branch's clothing. Also, the chopper that is seen in the opening scene is the wrong kind for that particular mission. You get other mistakes through the entire movie, and I could go on, but I have a limited space.

I can't recommend this as an addition to your DVD collection unless you are a fan of wrestling or a fan of Cena in the wrestling world. As a rental, I can only recommend this if your first eight picks are unavailable. Don't put this high on your Must See List. In fact, check this one out on HBO when there really is nothing else on.

Permalink",True,"I'm a Cena fan since he first arrived in the WWE and here he breaks into Hollywood with an action movie, many people have dismissed this as stupid and unoriginal. Its an action movie....

Cena is a marine who takes his girlfriend on a vacation, only for it to be interrupted by a group of armed robbers, they kidnap his girl and in turn leave him for dead. So the marine does what only he can. He pursues them to kill....

Cena tries hard to play another character yet it may seem to some people he is only playing himself...the other actors are bad...but the action is all that matters. Cena brings his in ring skills like Dwayne Johnson and puts them to use in fight scenes...Its all bare knuckle action which really pays off..

An average action movie, but I hope Cena will improve as he goes on.

Permalink",False,"A perfect dumb action movie for the Fourth of July weekend, because it features a heroic military guy and a whole lot of explosions. It's not too bad if you like that kind of movie. John Cena, a WWE wrestler, stars as the titular Marine. The film opens in Tikrit, where he rescues a bunch of his friends who are being held by terrorists. The scene plays hilariously just like the opening of The Naked Gun. I half expected Cena to yell at the terrorists as he left their base, ""Don't let me catch any of you guys in America!"" After that, Cena returns home to South Carolina and his hot wife (Kelly Carlson). He has a hard time settling down in his new life, where very few things explode and the best you can do is smash someone through a window or something. Luckily, he runs into bad guy Robert Patrick at the gas station, whose gang kidnaps his wife to use as a hostage. Finally, explosions return to his life. It's really hard to think of a 90 minute movie with more or bigger explosions. Cena is kind of a dull guy, but he certainly can beat the hell out of people when it's called for. Patrick is the best thing about the movie. The wacky, über-evil villain is a staple of action movies, but this one is particularly entertaining.

Permalink",True,"Wow. To say this movie sucked would be an understatement. Hell, I wouldn't lay on a bed of nails, I'd run it across it if it meant I never had to see this crap gracing a screen in front of me again.

John Cena stars as John Triton, a marine who is home on discharge. When his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) is snatched by some diamond thieves, he must hunt them in the wilderness of South Carolina to get his wife back, and take out the main baddie, Rome (Robert Patrick). Perhaps he should of just let them take her and went home. That way the movie could of ended all the more faster and I wouldn't of sat there, watching in disbelief this not awesomely bad garbage. I say ""not awesomely bad"" because ""awesomely bad"" is a good thing. This doesn't even fall into that category. It would be awesome if every copy of this movie were to somehow end up in the middle of a highway, anywhere in the U.S. mind you, and be ran over by every friggin' 18-Wheeler in the United States!!!

Don't get me wrong, I like Cena. He does have a certain charisma about him. But this movie has no charisma. Bottom of the barrel garbage at best. Spend you money on something else. Hell, don't even watch it for free!!!

Permalink",True,"Before watching this I knew John Cena was acting in it, and it wasn't going to surprise me of how bad it was. It's just a simple fact that celebrities can't act. But since being a fan of the WWE I felt an urge to watch it.

Anyhow, if you hadn't noticed I gave it a 5/10 because it was so pathetic, it's hilarious! ***DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT*** From the start John Cena entered a military base in the Middle-East standing still killing at least 10 people on the trot and a further 6 in a close-combat situation without a single bullet landing on him. This wasn't Terminator, it was worse. Later on his wife was kid napped by a gang of dangerous criminals, despite these people killing everyone but himself and his wife he managed to hijack a police car in which it looks and drives like a Lamorghini. So needless to say, he caught up with them in no time. Furthermore his vehicle got hit by around 3 whole clips from an assault rifle, a few clips from a handgun, and a whole lot of clips from an Uzi. And yet again, not a single bullet landed on him. You also get the same old 'surviving a huge fireball whilst diving out the way in the last second' malarkey, it happens a few times in fact. ***HUGE SPOILER*** And of course after taking a few baseball bats and sledgehammers to the chest and face area he manages to kill the leader and save his wife whilst operating CPR incorrectly. The ending was very predictable, which didn't make it as exciting. And yes, silly things like this happen throughout the movie.

***READ ON :)*** It is also quite comical at times, I mean intentional from acting. And the actors weren't great, they were quite bad to be honest. Except a few, taking Kelly whats-her-face for example.

Now I'm not trying to say this movie is BAD, it's just a little shallower than was advertised. It has action written all over it. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this, I am being lent this from a friend and recommend you to do the same, but I doubt many people have this movie so that's not really an option. And without the film being unrealastic, I would've rated it worse, seriously.

I know this review is full of negativeness :) but I can't review a film without a lot of negatives, sorry! :))

Permalink",False,"From the height and following extinction of the action heroes in the 80s and the 90s,we have seen some movies which try to resurrect them.On some occasions,the re-invention works very well(like in Shooter).On other occasions,it's simply a crappy movie with a lot of clichés.The Marine belongs to the second category.This film is made as a cheap action film made for DVD.The Marine is supported by an association of wrestling which tries to promote John Cena as an actor.Only with that,it's easy to note what kind of movie I'm talking about.This film is very predictable and it only has some good moments,but not thanks to the hero but thanks to the villain.Dwayne ''The Rock'' Johnson was a wrestler who decided to become an actor and,now,he is having success.But,now,we are seeing the consequences of that seeing more wrestlers who try to consolidate themselves as actors.First,we have seen Kane in See No Evil and,now,we have John Cena,who does not have even a pinch of talent as an actor and he does not show any charisma.Maybe,if the film was made as a satire,it would have been a solid parody.But,the film has a solemnity which makes the movie tedious.There's some humor in this movie,but it's involuntary.It's a bad signal when the villain of a movie is more interesting than the hero,but it is like that because the solid actor Robert Patrick shows a lot of charisma in his role.Besides Patrick,I do not find some positive element from this movie.If you wanna see a very good re-interpretation of the genre,watch Shooter and if you wanna see a good parody of the action genre,I recommend you Hot Fuzz.I give The Marine a 4 out of 10,but without Patrick,it would have been a 2 out of 10."

Permalink",False,"First I have to admit i caught this flick on cable and didn't watch the first half and hour or something. This is a dumb movie no questions about that. the plot is weak- and i didn't need to watch the whole movie to understand that, it is soo obvious- the actions scenes; as one user rightly pointed out; is even more unbelievable then transporter 2 and except Robert Patrick and the guy that played dozer in matrix the cast is really weak- don't even get me started with the lead actor, Steven seagall is Sir Laurence Oliver compared to him-. However this is a strange movie, the director desperately tries to do something different and imo he succeeds in some occasions. There are some scenes that don't serve the plot but still enjoyable to watch. The scenes with the group of villains led by Rome-played by Patrick- are really fun and at times even funny. I admit this movie sucks in many ways but I also feel that this director if given the right material and funds can really make some interesting and enjoyable action movies.

Permalink",False,"What a joke. Horrendous acting, unoriginal, clichéd plot. Predictable at every turn.

Girls in tight jeans, a roided cartooish hero, car chases, inept cops, sensationalized overly dramatic music.

Cena doesn't even sweat in this movie. I'll make a conservative guess that over 1,000 bullets are fired at him in the car chase, and the guy comes away from it like he just walked out of a day spa.

This movie is basically would you'd expect a WWE-produced flick to look like (at least the men are not wearing thongs) Cena is punched repeatedly, drives off a cliff in an exploding, bullet-ridden car, speeds through traffic, gets hit in the face with a fire extinguisher, survives an exploding gas station, gets hit in the head by a huge plank of wood, drives through a gasoline fire, gets hit with a metal pipe twice, gets hit with a metal sledge hammer, is choked by a metal chain, is shot at with military automatic weapons, is handcuffed, strapped into a chair and beaten, nearly stabbed, elbowed, kicked, nearly sliced in half by a chainsaw -- and that is in addition to him jumping, diving and leaping from various explosions. Try and grasp that if you can -- the guy's shirt isn't even stained.

The corny pep-talk from his security guard friend? Ironically being on TV after fighting with some guys? Wow The explosions are a little much, even for WWE.

If you have no attention span and are easily entertained by fire or shiny objects, by all means, check it out on HBO."

Permalink",True,"The only thing new in the film is the star JOHN CENA,a SUPERSTAR wrestler from the WWE,

His acting is as good as Hulk Hogan,or any other wrestler who has made movies.

Here he plays an ex-marine,who goes after the psychotic kidnappers of his pretty blond wife.. How many times have we seen this type of film,

The only thing different here, is that there is a chase scene in swampy tidal basin area,& there is a hungry alligator who has taken one of the dead kidnappers for dinner.

The locations are supposed to be South Carolina, BUT it was filmed in southern Australia,Brisbane area to be exact.

The screenplay is by the numbers & full of clichés.SPOILERS AHEAD

There were also at least 3 huge & I mean huge explosions, where our hero & others come out with hardly a scratch, In one of the chase scenes the auto our hero is in is basically torn apart by bullets, except him & the tires remain intact.

How many films have we seen like that in over the years.

Robert Patrick in the head villain, a real nasty psycho, The wise screenwriter uses a line from one of the TERMINATOR films that Patrick co-starred in. (What original writing & thinking) (LOL).

All the bad guys die one by one, with a showdown & another huge explosion at the end.

I will not tell you how he rescues his pretty wife.

There are 2 other ladies (both villains) scantily clad as usual.

Even though I am mentioning many faults, the movie is fast moving,

There is very little foul language, only a mild romance scene,no nudity, I did not expect much & saw what I expected.

Ratings: ** (out of 4) 60 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10)

Permalink",False,"This movie is really an entertaining ton of mediocre action!, it resembles the action films in the 80's in a comic and full of cliché way!, some of the funny relations with other films; John Triton makes a quest just like the one that Rambo did running away from cops (Rambo I), he also behaves a little like him, Rambo was discharged from the army doesn't he?; he also have the worst enemy of all times in action movies T-1000! from Terminator 2, and he's called ""terminator"" once in the film. This movie was entertaining; i loved movies from the 80's so it brought to me some good memories of the Rambo, Commando, Cobra films. But i have to be honest, the movie isn't good. The dialogs are so forced!, and full of clichés that you can turn off the TV at any moment. In one scene we see Triton talking with a guard in a building like this:

(Guard): This job is good, you can get to management in three years!. (Triton): How long have you been in this job?, (Guard): 9 years. (Triton): So why aren't you in management?. (Guard): Oh.

Can you believe that someone spend some time thinking This?!, well they did!. The action scenes are exaggerated a lot!; and how is possible that Triton is with a car, chasing a 4x4 full of bad guys armed to the teeth, without any gun, receives like 1000 shots and keep following them without a scratch, what was he thinking? The music simply spoils the movie, you can get nostalgic of Rambo with this movie, but sometimes this movie is offensive. Cena looks more like Incredible Hulk than a Marine, he look dumb, heavy and slow. This is the type of plot that you see to the end, entertaining but believe me, it's bad, an entertaining bad movie.

About the Film: John Cena (WWF star) plays John Triton a marine that is discharged for disobeying direct orders on a mission in Irak (he does in order to save his friends). Triton then tries to find a job and restore his life, in that moment, his path crosses with some diamond thieves leaded by Rome (Robert Patrick) who take his wife hostage and are running from cops. Triton chase them trough the wild forests of South Carolina trying to save his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson).

5/10!, for an entertaining but bad movie."

Permalink",False,"Clichéd, corpse-littered action movie adds nothing new to the standard guns and explosions escapism genre, and could very easily be renamed after any other by the numbers action flick of the past decade. Just discharged from the Corps, a dedicated Marine sergeant returns home to his loving wife and discovers that civilian life doesn't suit him. The two of them decide to be spontaneous and take a road trip, but along the way she's abducted and held hostage by a generic bad guy. Stupefyingly routine action movie is lots of violence and noise; by the third act you almost expect the actors to break character and question the all-too-familiar plotting and laughable dialogue. Patrick is wasted as the sardonic villain, Cena wooden as the hero in his big screen debut, but with this script not even Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman could make it worthwhile. They couldn't come up with at least one fresh idea? *½

Permalink",False,"Enough has been written on the bad sides of The Marine. All the negative remarks of those, who rated it 1/10, are fully justified. So let me mention the very few positive sides. Kelly Carlson is not the usual dumb, passive blonde, who only can wait for her hero. Robert Patrick is a nice baddie. Even John Cena has some acting talent; not as an action hero, but as a comedian. He is quite convincing as the fired marine, who does not fit in civil society. The way he loses his job is funny; the way he handles those three impudent guys is not sensible for a security agent, but completely trustworthy. At that very moment I hoped to see a tongue-in-cheek action movie, a kind of spoof of Rambo, Terminator or the like. The homecoming, our hero not wanting to admit, that he had lost his job within a day, was also good. These points - I cannot think of more - are enough for 3/10. As many others already have made clear: from the very point Kelly Carlson got kidnapped, the movie goes completely wrong. Stuff like this is not watchable, when it takes itself serious.

Cut the BS and get it done! This flick was too funny to be serious. Robert Patrick's character was the best. No offense to John Cena, cuz he could kick my behind, but his acting sucked. I did give him the benefit of the doubt since it was his film debut. But he needs to stay in the ring, leave the acting to the professionals, and leave the soldiering to the professionals. On the flip side, I though it was a great recruiting ad! All it needed was John Cena fighting a big lava monster on top of a volcano and being struck by a bolt of lightning and being transformed into a Marine in his dress blues with the voice-over saying ""The Few. The Proud. The Marines.""

Permalink",False,"John Triton (John Cena) is a former marine who is honorably discharged from the marines and has decided to spend some time with the wife, and find a job as a security guard however he loses said job when he throws a customer out a window. After this he decides to take a vacation with his wife however when a group of thieves (led by Robert Patrick) kidnap Triton's wife, Triton unleashes a one man fury that only a security guard could bring (Er, I mean Marine) If you look at the title, you realize this is going to be nothing but pure camp and being that the movie establishes a tongue in cheek tone as well as some admittedly enjoyable actions sequences, in that regard The Marine must be commended for at least not taking itself seriously. The Marine is often hilarious unintentionally, with the ridiculous villains and Cena's invincibility which recalls No Holds Barred with it's absurdity. The Marine however is buoyed by the performance of Robert Patrick, who is so over the top and cheesy that you eventually cave in and accept this as cheese. I must admit that I was a fan of the action flicks from yesterday and this was a guilty pleasure because of my said fondness of movies like Commando and American Ninja however The Marine doesn't quite measure up to the standards set by those movies in terms of guilty pleasure fun although, The Marine offers far more enjoyment than XXX or Papparazzi, although if that's not faint praise I don't know what is.

Permalink",False,"""The Marine"" is literally behind it's time as a popcorn action flick. Movies of this type are often seen as unimaginative, overdone and even trite. However, had this movie been made in 1987, it would have easily rivalled that of such classic 80's action movies as Commando and Under Siege.

The acting isn't Oscar grade, the plot is definitely questionable and the ending may even leave you wanting just a little more information, but this isn't the sort of movie you sit down to watch with a monocle, a snifter of brandy and a comfortable pair of slippers. It's a movie you kick back with your buddies and watch a Pro Wrestler turned actor blow stuff up and kill people whilst you down a few beers.

If you're a fan of deep plots, in-depth social commentary and movies with a moral, this isn't for you. However, if you are a fan of violence, movies where you don't have to think too hard whilst watching them, and a simple story of a man trying to rescue his wife by any means necessary then you'll find this movie entertaining. It's action packed, it has comedic moments and it's a fun movie.

Don't let the overly sensitive people or the uppity Oscar crowd sway your decision on whether this is a good movie or not. To each his (or her) own."

Permalink",True,"This is one of the ""chewing gum for the mind"" films, a WWE production. The story's simple: a discharged marine finds out that his wife has been taken hostage in a robbery and goes to rescue her. That he survives explosions and the like is to be expected in this kind of film.

The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and there are clues to that in some of the dialog and action. As an example, no police department or highway patrol would have a car anything like the one our hero, John Titan, commandeered to go after the crooks.

I cannot praise the film, nut it has a few good moments like the ""always blame the black man"" tirade.

Permalink",True,"After watching this movie, I can understand why some might not like the movie. The first 5 minutes or so the cut/editing/camera angle made it hard to follow or figure out what was going on. The cut scenes during some of the fights also left a lot to be desired, combined with the camera angles. If you can ignore that the movie actually wasn't too bad.

The biggest complaint I have seen about this movie is bad acting, and unoriginal plot, and predictable. This is very true but far as unoriginal and rehashed plot. what is original? Hollywood has done and redone everything imaginable so nothing is truly original anymore. Wooden acting? I am a big fan of Seagall movies and he cannot act either, its not why we go to Seagall movies. We watch movies like this for action, explosions and corny liners. This is what this movie has, but in this one it the bad guy thats over the top corny. The humour was OK and did seem to fit into the movie pretty well. Bottomline, if your a fan of Steven Seagall movies you will prolly want to see it, if you do not like Seagall movies this will not be a movie for you.

This is my first review so please bear with this and Thank You

Permalink",False,"A rehash of COMMANDO, THE MARINE has a former military man chasing down the kidnapers of his wife (his daughter in the original). Wrestling star John Cena stands in for Ah-nuld, and a busty blonde actress named Kelley Carlson stands in for 11-year-old Alyssa Milano. Cena is about as talented an actor as Ah-nuld, which isn't saying much, but Carlson has it all over Milano, at least in the breast department. Like Milano in the original, Carlson is scrappy, and we get to see a catfight between her and a raven-haired henchwoman who looks like she just dropped in from the set of THE INSIDE MAN. The script is junk, and Cena lacks Ah-nuld's charisma. He is a blank. A breathtaking car chase and a couple of PG-13 fight scenes help keep the movie afloat, along with a musical score that is better than the movie deserves. Robert ""X-Files"" Patrick plays the main villain strictly tongue-in-cheek. He even gets to mug for the camera when someone makes a reference to THE TERMINATOR, as Patrick appeared as the liquid metal android in T2.

Permalink",True,"I'm not sure why people so disappointed with the movie. It's a really old-fashioned senseless action movie in the best traditions of Terminator/Rambo/Crocodile Dandy with tons of bullets flying around, burning fire and heroic music. Sure, there is no plot, no character development, no physical laws.. The Hero is invincible, The Villain is evil, but *SPOILER* The Good is Winning and that's all we need to know! :) So, if you want to see some triller with deep twisting plot - just pass by, but if you're looking for an hour and a half of stunning action - welcome!

P.S. The joke about Terminator is really funny :)

Permalink",False,"""The Marine"" with John Cena is as pure of an Action movie as you can get. As a long-standing WWE fan, this was a must see for me. John Cena, an ex-Marine, has a long deserved vacation with his wife go horribly wrong. Crossing paths with a group of crazed thieves & murderers, he goes on an action-packed chase to catch them and rescue his wife.

The movie isn't going to be a classic & doesn't claim to be 100% accurate in military protocol and realism, but Cena and the rest of the cast do a pretty good job of entertaining us. Robert Patrick does an excellent job of playing the lead villain, and their supporting cast isn't horrible either. The movie had tons of bullets whizzing, stuff exploding, and bodies flying with some humor thrown in when you least expect it. If you're an Action junkie, you'll enjoy this movie.

Bottom Line: If you go watch this movie just expecting to be entertained, you should like it. Its not going to win any awards, but its still a good & enjoyable movie."

Permalink",False,"this was a good no holds bar action movie....action movies are not made to have the greatest acting and stories (just look at road house 2 and thats a classic). John cena needs to improve a bit on his acting but all in all the explosions were excellent and the movie kept you interested to see what something big was going to happen next. John Cena is just a bit too big and needs to lose some weight cause one movie flaw is they never showed him once working out or pumping iron...if you liked this movie i agree you would also like road house 2 (another action packed flick that does the job surprisingly). All in all I rate this movie 8/10 for any action lover....

Permalink",False,"I have seen a lot of movies and i enjoy different types of movies depending on the mood I am in. This is a fluff action movie thru and thru. With a weak plot and some suspect performances you could rate it as a 1 star movie. However, its also great fun and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

As with WWE its really about switching your brain off and just enjoying the show. I watched it twice over 2 days and still really really enjoyed it. kinda brainless action fun like commando was in the eighties.

If you are looking for an action popcorn flick this is the one.

Permalink",False,"I'll admit this movie wasn't Shakespeare but at least it was fun to watch.If you like movies with lots of shooting and non-stop explosions,then this movie is for you.If you hate movies with a lame plot cardboard characters, then by all means avoid this one.And if your a fan of John Cena you'll like this movie no matter how much it sucks.Because let me tell you this movie is pretty mediocer, but its never boring. The Marine isn't really worth buying, but it is renting and watching it at least once.

My final thought is simple:The marine is stupid,cheesy no brainer entertainment. It does what its supposed to do,give you something to do when your bored.

The story is very simple, the characters very stereotypical, as one would expect from an action flick. There are some good looking female actors, not to mention Mr.T-1000 and his sometimes funny acting. Robert Patrick should get more roles in a more gangster comedy type of movies, Cu's he rules.

so for all of you Rambo fans out there, check out the marine

We don't think that John Cena is going to be so good as The Rock, but if he sticks to the kind of role he played in this film he will do good as an actor.I think that if people liked the movie Walking Tall with The Rock, they will like this movie. It was kind of predictable at times. But I still kept watching, and enjoyed the movie. I was expecting a worse movie actually, with worse acting. I was surprised. I would recommend this movie for others to watch. It is a movie I would buy to own for sure, and watch many times.

Permalink",False,"I think whoever said that the movie sucked is wrong. Honestly now this is John Cenas first movie and I think he did really well for his first time. No actor/actress is good their first time. I think you guys just have no respect for that business or john. Lets say Arnolds first movie. Honestly though I think hes a bad actor. They want to promote their business and their wrestlers and I praise them for that. Every review I read , everyone said they liked it. So you must have something against WWE or you didn't really watch the movie. The whole plot of the movie is an ex marine is trying to spend time with his wife and they take her. So like every man does he goes and tries to help her. Every person who loved their spouse would do the same thing.

This John Cena character is idolized by wrestling fans and they will not be disappointed by this film. He acts the same as he does on the wrestling show he is on. I myself went into the movie with an open mind and ready to see an action adventure. I believe I got just that. People that expect to see great acting, story line, and overall academy award winning performances are nuts. This is just a movie for the John Cena fans no more no less. He is the hot wrestler right now so this is how he got this role. Anyone other than a John Cena wrestling fan will have negative comments about this film. I believe that is alright because the film was not made for non-fans.

Permalink",False,"Yes, I paid to see it.

This movie was everything I thought it could be. It lived up to it's full potential. Much like the Marines I actually know, it was violent, shallow, not terribly intelligent, displayed a profound affection for firearms and explosions, and was a cardboard cutout of others like it. I expected to be insulted, nay violated, by an experience similar to a mid-90's Van Damme 'film', and I got exactly that.

'The Marine' begins in the Middle East. I'm not sure if the country is mentioned, and it's not important. The title character, embodied by John Cena (a wrestler, I assume) as 'John Trident' awaits orders outside a desert hooch occupied by Arab Bad Guys (tm) and their soon-to-be-beheaded Marine captives. Trident relays his sitrep to command and is told to stand down, as 'Delta' is en route. Needless to say, there is no time. So Trident disobeys and stomps into the hooch, killing everything unamerican that he sees/hears/smells. We are then spared the details of their escape from enemy territory by two lines of dialog; ""How do we get around, Sargeant?"" ""We don't. We go through."" Naturally, Trident is dismissed from the Corps (without the tedium of a court martial) and, sadly, must return home to his gorgeous wife in America.

We are then treated to the Bad Guy (tm) establishing scene, inexplicably starring Robert Patrick, whom I now suspect has a serious gambling problem. In this scene, the BG's steal some diamonds, and get into a Black Towncar (tm). Predictably, a policeman who's apparently transporting 150 gallons of gasoline to the station in his squadcar happens by with his siren on. Mistaking this for a police response to the robbery, Patrick gets out of the car and shoots several holes in it with a CAR-15, yielding the expected results.

Next, Trident and Hottie McGee decide to take a road trip. They run into the BGs who wifenap Hottie McGee for no reason. Conveniently, when John manages to egress the exploding gas-stop, he finds a dying state trooper with an empty revolver, and more importantly, his Camaro Interceptor. I don't know if you know cars, but those things can HAUL ASS. I mean like, in reality. But I'll bet you didn't know that they can re-inflate their own tires, and take well over 500 rounds of 9mm parabellum ammunition to the radiator without so much as a smoky discharge, did ya? The chase leads us into Florida swamplands where Trident hunts down his wife's captors, and even has a pointless, random, 15 minute run-in with some swamp-folk.

The final battle takes place when Trident tracks down Bad Guy Numero Uno (tm), Patrick, who's still got his wife, at a swap-side truck stop. Naturally, Patrick commandeers a semi-tractor, and naturally, he jumps out after securing her to it and pointing towards an Explosion Factory (tm). The rig crashes through the Explosion Factory (tm) with the expected results, till it launches up the Pointless Ramp (tm) at the back of the factory through the Plate-Glass Window (tm) overlooking the water. Were Mrs. Trident not cuffed in the sleeper, I'm sure it would have burst into flames as soon as it became airborne. Somehow, John Cena manages to overcome Robert Patrick, difficult though it would be for him in reality, dives into the water (just as the main cache of asplosion material ignites) and barely manages to get his wife out and administer CPR in time for her miraculous, asplosion back-lit, recovery. As he tenderly holds her in preparation the final, horrible one-liner that you know is coming, Patrick stumbles out of the factory, which is somehow still standing, and attacks. Trident dispatches him in what has got to be the most clever and enjoyable Bad Guy Second-Death (tm) in recent history, then returns to his former position to deliver said abomination.

All-in-all, this movie is totally worth it if it's free and you've got NOTHING else to do."

Permalink",True,"Watching ""The Marine"" is like watching the entire filmography of Steven Seagal reincarnated. Bad leaps to mind first, then cheesy, then dumb, and finally charming (though only kind of). This film marches into theaters without a hint of pretension. John Cena makes his feature film debut here probably trying to recreate the magic that led to The Rock becoming a movie star. The problem is that Cena doesn't have half the charisma of The Rock. Not that I especially like The Rock, just that by comparison Cena looks like stale white bread. He shows up here with a ripped body, which is about all you need to be cast as an action star today. The plot is very in depth so pay attention: John Triton (Cena) gets back from the marines and his wife (Kelly Carlson, using the skills she learned on ""Nip/Tuck"" to play plastic perfectly) is kidnapped by bad guys, so Triton chases them through the backwaters of South Carolina trying to rescue her. There is actually a lot to like here. The bad guys are delightfully hilarious as they bicker amongst themselves and occasionally kill one another. The car chase is grotesquely unrealistic, but just what you hope for in an action sequence as by the time it was over my mind was pulsing and hoping for more. I also liked the very obvious homage to the Terminator (which is funny, you see, because the bad guy here is played by Robert Patrick). But the production value on the film is something that I just can't get past. I have no idea how this film was so lucky as to avoid the straight to video fate of so many other action flicks. The music was, by far, the worst. It sounds like it was lifted from either Looney Tunes or a bad 70's crime show. I am also assuming that 90% of the budget of this film went towards blowing stuff up. So if you like seeing stuff blown up this is the film for you. And it's not just explosions, it is big, massive explosions, the likes of which we rarely see, and they all have John Cena diving out of them in the nick of time.

Since this is only the second film put out by WWE Films (""See No Evil"" was the first) I am viewing it as the equivalent of early 80's wrestling under Vince McMahon. There are good guys and bad guys and no middle ground. Everything is very cartoony and juvenile. And it is aimed right at the dumbest members of our society. Over the years WWE programming has gotten more intelligent and more nuanced, so there is hope for this new film company. But for now we are stuck watching John Cena play a marine who is fond of pro wrestling moves (is that what they are teaching now) to save his wife. And it can pretend that it above racial prejudice by having the sole black character rant against it. But it can't escape the fact that that character is also a villain and that Triton's wife is Aryan looking while the female villain has nothing but dark features and dark hair. But hey, give the people what they want, right? **3/4

Permalink",False,"Everyone has to start somewhere. And it's a mistake to be too hard on a movie like ""The Marine"" and expect it fulfill your wishes for a much higher-budget production like one of the Rocky movies (for the impossible military rescue that began the story), Inside Man (for bank robbery that set up the plot) or Mission Impossible III (for the amazing wife rescue). To me, it's a good all round ""atta-boy, go-get-em, hoo-ah"" story best watched at Fort Benning, Georgia in a theater full of new recruits taking a much-needed break from boot camp or candidates at the Airborne School. And actually, this one would do extremely well at Bond University in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, because that's the building the film crew used to make us think we were at the ""Marine Headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany""  some eight time zones away to the northwest. I can imagine how the students would holler and cheer when they saw their school on the big screen. And ""South Carolina"", where the story supposedly takes us, is also filmed in Australia - 14 time zones earlier. But the effort drew in Warner Bros. Australia and allowed that film company to get some good experience in production. And John Cena gives anyone who has ever tried to get into shape and be the ideal husband/hero something to aspire to. Good job, John! It really helps if you are the type who still believes in Santa Claus or that Thursday night wrestling is real and un-choreographed. Or, let's put it another way. If you can remember what it was like to be a child. If you haven't lost that gift, this is a good time out of the house. Where else do you see gas stations blowing up, alligators attacking fearlessly (no, they don't really do it that way), new state of the art guns and knives? How many parts can a police car lose and still be in the chase? Well? You saw it all at ""The Marine""! If you don't like it, just go do better! I'll be glad to watch. The characters were as believable as they could be in a pure fantasy of a story. It was a good time!"

Robert Patrick has finished 5 films since, and is currently filming a 6th. This is a great example of a film that should have gone straight to rental. Let me change that, straight to the Best Buy 2.99 bin.

What the heck was Patrick thinking. I realize you have to make a living, but wtf. Looking at the ""movie"" from an action standpoint ONLY,I guess you could sit through it in a pinch.

Permalink",False,"I have a friend who's a fan of the WWE so it's because of him that I agreed to see The Marine. The only actor I noticed was Robert Patrick from Terminator 2 and I liked the line that referenced that movie. There was also a black character that seemed to have wandered from Tarantino territory with references to how he doesn't like rock candy and his experiences with 'Johnny Whiplash' from summer camp that amused me a little. As an action hero, John Cena did pretty well with himself in the various fighting stunts he no doubt trained for in his WWE career. Having said all that, I found the movie ridiculous almost from the beginning what with all the car explosions and gun fighting that only the Cena hero survives intact again and again. The movie gets a little more tolerable as it goes on but it didn't make me say, ""Wow, this was a great action flick!"" Instead I was simply glad it was over. My friend, on the other hand, loved it. So watch if you love the WWE and John Cena, but don't expect an intelligent thriller.

Well, repetitive, yes (in fact, I noticed the same ball of fire used for every three seconds of the film in every crash of every vehicle, building or person). But fun? (I've HEARD porn movies are fun, though the wrong kind of fun.) No. No fun. That's where the similarities end.

All this and the awe-inspiring setting of South Carolina (because of its proximity to Parris Island no doubt, no where else a Marine would want to live) to boot (camp).

This movie is awful from the opening to the...errr....climax...

(NOTE TO WWE Fans: If you are a WWE fan, of course, this movie is wonderful and a one- star rating is really a 10-star rating because ""Y'all"" as they say in South Cackalacky, live in Opposite Land where ""professional"" wrestling is a real sport, populated by great actors who aren't acting at all in their wrestling.

The plot line even though mediocre, kept my attention throughout the storyline, which is more then I can say for most other movies. Even though the acting was terrible and somehow WWE wrestlemania acting rears its ugly head every 20th line, the camera work makes up for it as well as the absurd amount of special effects, as literally everything ends up blowing up which was the main benefactor in the end. Great ""stupid"" movie.

Permalink",True,"Now there may be some who say this is another punch, kick and romance film, but John Cena looks, acts and moves like if he was nothing but a Marine - when you place the fact of what kind of character he tends to play in WWE's ""Raw"" or ""Smackdown"" then you see another kind of person, same abilities but different applications...

When with ""Semper Fi"" (Marines' motto) he broke regulations to save comrades from Al Qaeda operatives in not waiting for reinforcements, yet despite their being alive due to him, he was given a choice - an honorable discharge or a court-martial... Even his superior officer did not want him let go and arranged for the decommission with full honours! The way he dispatched the terrorists, was a bit queasy yet astounding, stepping on a neck 'til it snaps; shooting through a corpse while using it as a shield; beating a man with a burning plank of wood - it is amazing, if you have the DVD? Choose ""unrated"" to get the full effects! Now sent back home, Cena's life as a security guard went astray due to a stalking ex-boyfriend fighting with a secretary (this psycho's daddy was a rich-man, so guess who gets to shift scott-free?), so starts The Marine's trip into South Carolina as a means of pleasing his wife, who wants him to relax...

Enter Robert (Terminator 2, X-Files) Patrick and a trigger-happy bunch of jewel-thieves to rip off a shipment of diamonds just arrived, they do a getaway along the same route Cena travels and end up at the same gas station he is at - their first mistake! Then they take his jeep as a new getaway vehicle and his wife as hostage - their second and last mistakes! When they blow up the gas station and think he's dead, shoot the police car he borrowed to pursue the gang - one of them asks ""My God, what is he? The Terminator?"" and Robert Patrick just glares into the mirror of the SUV as the comment is made, a classic! It is not enough to say he took a lash with a sledge hammer or swam underwater far, any fit person may attempt those things but it is a Marine who can, will and must do them in reality - no offense to Cena but as fit as he is, I doubt he can do half of what a Marine can really do! One psycho in the gathering of crooks was quite humorous if stereotyped, Morgan - a black bazooka-launcher who hates camping - and he had a serious aversion to rock-candy... But his predilection for a fancy car and his assurance that ""Brothers don't camp"" and then he proceeds to contradict himself and give a ""delivery"" about his encounter with a counsellor when he was 13, hilarious! Abigail Bianca plays the bad-girl who in the end meets a swift demise as she is pelted out of a Mack truck straight into an oncoming bus! Yeesh, not for the squeamish! But in the end, Robert Patrick came close to reprising his T-1000 role, as he seeks revenge on Cena, who in not missing a beat, issues a ""chain"" reaction and he goes back to resuscitating his wife.

In all, if you want an intellectual yarn, look for some version of ""Pride & Prejudice"", but if you want action galore - then this DVD is for you, it has extra features; Cena on WWE, Cena in Australia and other stuff like commentaries, if you're into that...

Permalink",True,"If a ECW fan watch the movie, then he/she would say: ""Cena: You can't act..."" :OP sorry; but is true. This movie is a typical action movie without history and the wwe champ does not reach very much. Another unsuccessful attempt of push up the controversial champion? please, not at the cost of the good taste in the cinema. Any way, Robert Patrick feels comfortable in a personage to whom he is accustomed and he fulfills well his function inside the movie. Is not bad. The movie is not the great thing, but it fulfills his function to entertain. For the action movie fans, i guarantee them that there will be shots, explosions and flying cars. Another thing? well ""You can't see it""

Permalink",False,"I saw this movie when it opened the WWE did a great job promoting it and it had everything it said it was going to have in it. John Cena made is first movie and he showed his skills as a fighting just like he does in the ring.there was a lot of action and you understood the plot unlike Kanes See No Evil out early this year.I love John Cena as a wrestler, rapper and movie star. He shows how strong he is in real life and how he doesn't stop until the mission is done.He started out like the Rock did in an action movie and yeah it wasn't that good but he can improve on it just like the Rock did. John did say he will never give up wrestling because its in his blood but he would make more movies. And if he does make more movies I'm sure all of his fans will it because there are a lot of ChainGang Soldiers out there that ride with him no matter what happens.

Permalink",False,"The anti-military bias of many reviewers here is evident, as is their lack of appreciation of the fact that this is a movie. Or perhaps they expected an anti-war sensitive movie with which they would be more comfortable. This is NOT a political movie in any way, but there is a brief heroic opening scene in Iraq. Is that the source of their trashing of this excellent movie?

This is in fact a terrific action/adventure movie in the mold of the Rambo or Schwarzenegger films (eg ""Commando"") or the Indiana Jones series. The violence is not accurate in depiction of results, but neither is it in any movie where female stars takes full-power strikes and come bouncing back. If reality counted in the movies, there would be no girl-star action movies.

The violence is actually toned down in favor of action. For example, Sgt. Triton chooses to takes out two very tough villains in exciting brawls when he has a good fighting knife with him. Reality would have been different and much bloodier. Not much gore or blood in this picture, however, and you can safely take your pre-teen or teen son. Or yourself. My wife liked it, too, for that matter.

The acting was top-drawer within the context of the plot. Triton was seen first in front of his commanding officer,then interacting with his wife. He was supposed to be emotionally restrained with his commander, and strong but a little reflective with his wife .He was. Then The Marine had a mission. He had to complete it, not emote and burst into tears. After the adrenalin high wore off, he'd probably start shaking, but while things were going on, he didn't have time to be upset. Man, haven't the sweetie-boys who have panned his acting ever been in a fight? I never heard of the star,but he turned in a very believable good performance for the part. The excellent-looking wife did a fine job as well. No nudity in this movie. Unfortunately.

In sum, a fine example of its type and highly recommended for all. It requires some suspension of belief, but most action movies do. It will grab you hard and keep you watching."

Permalink",False,"Here is what I think. They should not have made this a rated PG-13 film. The directors are trying to cater to adults and children with this film. The movie was not boring but,It is not possible to cater to children and adults. My 5 year old niece was with me at the movies and usually she will look at an action packed film but, with this one she start playing with the back of the seats.

Hollywood just think that we are dumb. They are taking theses old recycled scripts off the shelf that they had collecting dust and making about one or two changes with different characters and feeding them to the public. Most of the scripts are so predictable.

They are also doing to much editing in the film. This movie is based mostly off of the old movie called ""The Chase"" with Charlie Sheen . The Rundown was a good movie even though it was a pg-13 movie but they might as well made this a rated-R movie.They are cutting out the most important seens that actually tells the story of the movie.I expect more at the end of the movie at least go to the next day just don't stop on any scene. The way I see it you all never got finish telling the story."

Permalink",False,"I really really really wanted it to be good. This was awful. That is all I have to say about this movie but IMDb has a requirement of 10 lines as a minimum so I am writing this. This movie is truly horrible though. I could not suspend my intelligence enough to buy into the interactions and dialog. The pathetic shoot outs were just bad. All those bullets and John doesn't get hit once. John gets punched and hit in ways that would have disabled or killed any other human and it doesn't seam to faze him. I tried to submit again and still didn't have enough lines. Save your soul from enduring this worthless movie. IMDb says I need to have 10 lines to submit but one line is all you need about this movie. It is disgusting. Kelly Carlson looking f...ing gorgeous just couldn't maintain a boner all the way through a god awful film like this. The Terminator guy lowered his standards to act in this movie of shame.

Permalink",True,"Honorably discharged for disobeying a direct order to wait for back up, instead entering the line of fire to rescue soldiers on his own, John Triton(John Cena) , a marine of high standing, returns home. A gig as a security guard goes badly on the first day(he throws a disruptive, rude civilian, who was scrutinizing a girlfriend in one of the offices, through a window!)and so John and the missus, Kate(Kelly Carlson) go on a trip to the mountains but come across,(wrong place, wrong time), a crime as it is erupting at a gas station, resulting in a cop shot. Robert Patrick is the leader of a group, Rome, who robs a jewel store, carrying away millions of dollars worth of diamonds. This team(which includes Anthony Ray Parker, Abigail Bianca, and Manu Bennett) is the one behind the murder of three people at the gas station, kidnapping Kate, nearly killing John in an explosion. Rome will learn the hard way how unfortunate his kidnapping Kate was. No matter what Rome and his hired guns do, John keeps coming. Making their way through a South Carolina swamp, Rome and company, Kate in tow, will try to evade law enforcement, and Triton. Jerome Ehlers is a cop, Van Buren, in charge of capturing Rome, but he just might have other reasons for catching him.

There are times where I just want to have some fun, and, critics be damned, THE MARINE delivered everything I desire as an undemanding action junkie. We have THREE buildings going ka-boom in phenomenal style, Cena surviving each and every time without so much as a burn. I swear I believe Cena's hero's skull was made of titanium steel the way he takes repeated blows to the face. There's one moment where Cena takes a direct shot to the back of the head by a 2X4 which explodes into splinters on impact. During their climactic showdown, Patrick lands a crushing shot to Cena's ribs with a sledgehammer. When Cena first encounters the group at the gas station, he is hit across the face with a fire extinguisher..not one of those small ones, this fire extinguisher was of a more massive size. Carlson is a supermodel babe whose hand is handcuffed to a bar in a diesel that goes through constant exploding fireballs and tanks, even submerging underwater, yet she is able to survive. But the whopper of a preposterous scene which had me up and applauding like a kid watching COMMANDO & RAMBO II, has Patrick and his gang blasting away a constant barrage of machine gun and pistol fire at Cena from within an already battle-scarred police car(no ordinary Highway Patrol car, this vehicle looked like one of those supercars you'd see in THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS)as bits and pieces come flying off, a door, hood, bumper, it resembled some sort of cartoon. And there's another doozy sequence when Patrick avoids an exploding police car as it comes crashing down after being sent up in the air by a rocket launcher. In action movies I personally want all this stuff. I love the DIE HARD sound and fury and THE MARINE follows this mould to the nth degree. I savored and relished every moment of this movie and Patrick even gets a TERMINATOR reference to boot which put the icing on the cake as far as I was concerned. There's just nothing like seeing Patrick's dame and Cena's wife going a round of fisticuffs yet maintaining their beautiful faces. I'm amazed this movie was rated PG-13; THE MARINE certainly pushes the rating to the limit. I mean when you see Cena hurl a baddie through the windshield of a bus as the diamonds fall to the floor with blood included into the sparkles, I think the rating of PG-13 is stretched pretty thin. That said I definitely recommend THE MARINE to those who are looking for one of the most implausible, outrageous action films of the last few years, which has a smirking Patrick having such a good time while Cena is all muscle and business. Let's not kid ourselves, though, the real star of the film is all the pyrotechnics..Lord knows I love seeing buildings go up into giant balls of flame as the hero narrowly escapes.
