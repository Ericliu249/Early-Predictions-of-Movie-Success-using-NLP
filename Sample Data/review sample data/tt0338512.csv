Permalink",False,"Am rarely moved to comment on what others say here, but Sarah from Canada's mindless and cynical response to TWO BROTHERS can't go unchallenged. Though far from perfect, I found this movie to be exceptionally entertaining on all accounts. Sarah claims there's no story, no characters, no moral ... on and on. Well, what she says is a complete crock: there is a story: it's about the two tiger brothers who are taken from their jungle home. The two main characters are not human, and I guess the fact that they don't have dialogue presented quite an obstacle for Sarah because she doesn't seem to have followed their story and its moral/ethical significance. Since the movie plays out like a fairy tale, realism here is not the point, hence the broad human characterizations. Rather, the most successful parts of the film allows us to view the world from the animals' eyes, and in doing so we experience their feelings, memories, and needs. I found this to be entertaining and at times quite moving. The film makers ennoble these tiger characters with such power and respect, I find it utterly mystifying that anyone could miss this as being the major point of the film. Please do not let negative comments like the ones from Sarah keep you from watching this terrific movie."

Permalink",False,"WOW!!!! OK, I will confess up front that I am prejudiced. I am a wildlife artist with a lifetime love of tigers and have even had the awesome opportunity to play with 3 10-week old tiger brothers. I loved this movie, not just for the obvious reasons of being a tiger loving artist that loves all animal films anyway. This movie was making a statement regarding how these beautiful creatures are being hunted to extinction!

How sad to have to hunt down and kill an animal to prove your manhood or to use them for mistaken ancient beliefs where their bodyparts are used for medicine. Granted they aren't harmless, but men continue to encroach on the wild areas all over the world without thought of the animals and ecosystems, of the beauty they destroy.

No, I'm not an overzealous environmentalist belonging to Greenpeace or PETA, though they have the right idea...just a little too far left for me. Still, looking at the awesome, beautiful world God has given us, its sad to see animals hunted to extinction for no reason other than to show everyone that you can pull a trigger. Ooooooooooo, big amount of talent for that.

This movie, besides its message of the dwindling numbers of tigers left in the wild and why they are endangered, was an absolute joy. How some of these shots of the tigers, as they grew, were obtained, I have no idea. But it was great, in fact, I love it, the tigers got billing over the human actors!

It's the story of 2 tiger cubs that are captured when a hunter kills their father and they become separated from their mother. They then become separated from each other, one going to a hunter and eventually ending up in a circus run by people that seem to think animal cruelty is the only way to train an animal. The other winds up in a family with a loving little boy, but eventually outgrows his welcome and ends up in a private zoo, also being mistreated. The tigers meet again, when for some sick idea of sport, the 2 tigers are set against each other in a fight to the death. Then the brothers recognize each other. I won't ruin it for you. Just know that it does have a good ending!

I was impressed that there is a tag at the end of the movie, one that is quite true. In the early 1900's there were over 100,000 tigers in the wild, now there are less than 400-200. Three species are already extinct. See the information from a website:

Bengal Tiger  Panthera tigris tigris Siberian (Amurian) Tiger  Panthera tigris altaica Sumatran Tiger  Panthera tigris sumatrae Indo-Chinese Tiger  Panthera tigris corbetti South China Tiger  Panthera tigris amoyensis Javan Tiger  Panthera tigris sondaica  extinct since early 1980's

Bali Tiger  Panthera tigris balica  extinct since the 1940's

Caspian Tiger  Panthera tigris virgata  extinct since the early 1970's

Watch the movie, it will warm your heart, make you smile and perhaps even shed a tear. If you would like to help save tigers, in the wild or aid the ones that needlessly wind up in rescue organizations. Thank God for them! People seem to think it would be cool to have a tiger, or other big cat, for a pet, then seem surprised that they grow into 500-700+ pound meat eaters! I own several house cats...these smaller guys have a whole lot in common with their 'big' brothers and I have the scars to prove it. (Not that they are mean, I just get in the way of their racetrack sometimes)

Still, tigers are wild animals and not meant to be pets! If nothing else, even if you have raised one, they don't know their own strength...just ask Roy Horn of Siefried and Roy fame. I doubt that tiger meant any harm to Roy, but the tiger sensed Roy was in danger and tried to carry him to safety the same way she would carry a cub...by the scruff of the neck.

That being said...don't try to raise one, but please try to help the ones in rescue shelters that desperately need the funds to care for these tigers that can't be released back into the wild. Or help the remaining few in the wild."

Permalink",False,"Two brothers is a uniquely great movie. Although some may criticize it for the depiction of cruelty to animals, the movie is not advocating cruelty or teaching kids wrong lessons. You begin to love the tigers from the very first second you see them on screen, and your heart breaks every time something happens to them. The movie isn't an insult to our species, it tells us and shows us how we have wronged nature in the past, and promotes us to fix our past transgressions. By seeing the cute (EXTREMELY cute) tigers harassed on screen, kids will definitely develop a passion for the conservation of wildlife and will develop a general humaneness towards other creatures. Although some scenes are disturbing and could scare children, the movie does a good job of keeping them interested, worried, and warmed in the end. Even though Guy Pearce delivers another sub-par performance, adults are not the stars of the film. This movie will definitely play with your emotions, and some may not be able to handle it, but be assured, the movie may leave you spent, but it'll leave you blissful. I enjoyed every second, from the warmth of the playing tigers cubs to the stabbing pain when any of them got hurt. I spent the credits with tears running down my face. If you are in touch with yourself, this movie will not disappoint."

The story is there, so if Sarah from Canada doesn't see one, well, that's her loss.

I found myself talking to the cubs as they were trying to escape the hunters, roting them on, and yelling, ""WOO HOO"" when they finally escaped the danger.

The plight of these animals is all to real, unfortunately. If even one movie like this can help slow their extinction, then it's worth watching & becoming more involved with groups fighting for wildlife preservation.

All parents should take their kids to watch such movies, it will make them love and care for animals. It also creates very important environmental awareness too. The director seems a great person to make both ""Two Brothers"" and ""The Bear"". Both movies are on animals and the tragedies they come across. And they both make humans empathetic of animals. The two Tiger cubs were great actors, and made us sad with their helplessness in some parts. It makes us realise how innocent animals are. Two thumbs up for this movie!!

Permalink",False,"DISCLAIMER: This is my first movie review, so please excuse me, if it is not written well, including the fact that my English is not good.

I just finished viewing ""Two Brothers"". Honestly, I've never expected anymore to see a movie of that class.

What do I mean?

These days there are so much new movies, which is so wonderful, because so many people now have the chance to express themselves and do a movie, but not many of them know how to do it. There are people, who do know and there are people, which do have talent.

I still remember, when I saw ""The Bear"". Not much, but I do remember it really got me with it. Years ago, there were really movies, that had what to offer to the spectator. I still prefer more, the commercial movies, but do miss the real good cinema.

And so, few days back I was just watching around the rent-a-video club, when I saw the title. At first, though it is yet another action movie, until I saw the front cover. These days, adventure movies are rare. The director's name immediately grabbed my attention and really threw me thinking. Jean-Jacques Annaud did another adventure? I did not read the text on the cover, just was thinking to myself... These tigers really reminded me of ""The Bear""... Was it a little nostalgia?

Whatever it was, it is wonderful. I do not remember myself enjoying so much, for a long time. The movie is appropriate for most ages, with good plot. Very slight mixture of this specific old-school fragrance and modern computer graphic effects. It is so precisely mixed, that at the beginning You will never realize is it real, You are watching or computer-made.

In fact, the movie, I think I may say so, is sort of a masterpiece, but since I am not very competent of the technical details, will not discuss them, except mentioning just in brief.

Wonderful graphics, exotic views, well mixed sound, good music, great story, interesting point of views... remarkable.

A thing to notice here, is that it did not made me remember just of ""The Bear"". Actually in the beginning I was thinking of ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"". Annaud spend big amount of time, exploring the relationships of the tigers, the tigers and the people, the people, the people and tigers. There are some very precisely dosed moments, showing the two tigers in perspectives, You would really love to explore. I just love the way he did it!

You will never realize how these 109 minutes will pass around You, so better stop reading this and go see it!

Have a good time!"

Permalink",False,"Jean-Jacques Annaud's films always showcases animals doing extremely amazing things, which is why they are so enjoyable. While this is a film better seen by children of certain age group, it's not a Disney product, and parents should be aware of that fact. Some comments in this IMDb forum criticize the film makers for what they perceive was a marketing ploy that targeted the movie to small children. Perhaps the people that promoted the film are to be blamed for that, or maybe Mr. Annaud was targeting the film for a more mature audience.

""Two Brothers"" is a story about two tigers that are separated at a young stage of their lives, while their parents are killed by people that loved to engage in this type of hunting. The two little cubs are about the best in the film as one see them getting in all kinds of adventures in the first part of the film.

The story behind the animals serves the film as it provides an accessible background as it illustrates the inter action between humans and animals. Guy Pearce and Freddie Highmore are seen in the film as Aidan and Raoul. Freddie Highmore is a child actor with an expressive face that shows a child of great intelligence without any trace of ego.

As Mr. Annaud proved with ""The Bear"", he has a good eye for involving the animals in his stories about them with surprising results."

Permalink",True,"I came across this film on a TV channel today. I was definitely amazed by the style of film making and editing that one can see in the movie. It must have been hard to make the tigers portray such beautiful emotions. It is a feel good family movie with a great story line and excellent acting from all the lead actors, including the child and the tigers. The relationship between the two tigers, and their relationship with humans, mainly the hunter and the child have been wonderfully presented by the director.

I am an Indian and people in India are fighting to save the last remaining members of the 'Big Cat'. This movie is ideal for all tiger lovers and can be used in the campaign for saving tigers, to educate the masses about the pain and agony tigers go through, because of selfish human actions. It is one of the best movies I've seen.

Permalink",False,"""Two Brothers"" is a magnificent movie. From the spectacular footage of the Asian jungle to the heartwarming (and heart-wrenching) tale of two beautiful tiger brothers. ""Two Brothers"" realistically tells both the human side of the story as well as the tiger's, and the conflicts that can occur when the two come together. This movie is educational for adults and children alike. Beautiful music and scenic cinematography make this film a true work of art. I went to see ""Two Brothers"" on opening night and I liked it so much I had to go back and see it again the next day. Entertaining and educational, ""Two Brothers"" is a movie that EVERY person should see! I Highly recommend this movie and give it 5 stars!

Permalink",False,"I actually don't know if I would take kids to see this film. Both I and my bf found it very difficult to watch all the hunting and killing scenes. While the film does not show any direct shots of lives being taken, it's very implicit and the movie does show carcasses and furs afterwards. I loved the story of the tiger ""family"" (even though I'm not so sure how realistic this is), but I honestly considered walking out of the theater due to the violence portrayed. That said, I think this film is VERY difficult for animal lovers (particularly those against hunting) to watch. Also, I think I would have appreciated a simple one line introduction regarding time and setting (unless I missed this or it was cut out of the EU version). I only knew it was set in Cambodia after reading the plot summary and I assume it was circa 1920-30's based on the costumes. Some background would have given the film a little more context in my opinion (Why were the French in Cambodia, and what was the this road they were trying to build?)

Permalink",False,"Two Brothers starts with the siblings, Kumal and Sangha, and shows how they are playful and protective of one another. Kumal was the more meek of the two and Sangha would knowingly protect his brother when in trouble. After the older tigers were killed (seems the villagers do not like random tigers hanging out while they are working), Kumal and Sangha are separated. Kumal ends up in a circus like atmosphere where he is trained to jump through flaming hoops and such (which actually comes in handy later in the movie). Sangha ends up, at first, with a family. Raoul (Freddie Highmore) loves Sangha but is forced to give him up, due to Sangha killing the family dog in self-defense. It now had the taste of blood and was no longer safe to be in the company of humans.

As both tigers became adults, they had led a less than extraordinary life, both with cruel owners and both ending up in a cock-fighting environment, where they were forced to fight one another.

To me, the only enjoyable part of this movie were the tigers, themselves. The people only made it boring and wishing for the movie to either end or cut back to the tiger footage. I assume the tigers were trained to do certain things and then pieced together to form a cohesive story for them. Other footage seemed to be just film of the tigers acting naturally, which was important for the movie.

Two Brothers was a great children's movie. Some adults would probably enjoy it as well but it was definitely not made for them. This is not the kind of movie I could watch over and over but was worth seeing at least once."

Permalink",True,"Two Brothers is a nice family film to watch but it becomes to cheesy to take by the end. Two brother tiger cubs are separated at an early age when their mother is killed by a hunter (Guy Pearce). The bolder one is sold to a circus where his spirit is broken, while the gentler one fights for his survival becoming wilder and more fierce. When they meet again as adults, they are pitted against each other as enemies. The plot is something different then the average kids film yet this film will probably be more liked by adults. The story may bore kids too much as its not action packed nor is it an animated film. Granted, there were some boring spots but those were few and far in between. The kids may be turned off by the fact that a tiger gets shot in this film. Only one actually dies from a gunshot but another one is hit in the ear. The baby tigers are very cute and are fun to watch. The only human actor worth mentioning is Guy Pearce. He is overshadowed by the tigers but still does a good job. Jean-Jacques Annaud directs and he does a pretty good job. Two Brothers has amazing cinematography, probably some of the best I have seen all year. There's not a whole lot of dialog so kids may not like that. While it's a beautiful film to watch, sometimes I felt like I was watching the discovery channel or something. The running time of 108 minutes could have been cut down as not all was needed. I was enjoying the film until the end, then it became too cheesy to like. The brothers managed to met up with each other and they both manage to escape from the circus. When they successfully escaped they met up with their mom again and became one happy family. I thought this was a little too much but it's a kids film so they wanted a happy ending. I didn't like it though as it could have been a different type of family film if it had ended a little differently. In the end, this is a nice film to look at and its slightly above average as well. Rating 7/10, better then the most recent family film.

Permalink",False,"Two tiger cubs are born deep in the jungles of French Indo-China. The tiger cubs are growing up among ancient temple ruins, which will bring the outside world to their home. One of the tiger cubs is gentle in nature and the other is brave. One of the tiger cubs is captured when a famous hunter (Guy Pearce) goes to the temple to loot its statues. A circus buys the tiger cub for its tiger act. The circus trainer uses force to make him jump through a hoop of fire and be a true tiger act. Later, the other cub is captured, and the regional administrator gives the tiger to his son. The tiger cub tears up the house and has a conflict with their dog, so the boy is forced to give the tiger away to the king's animal museum. A year later, the two brothers are matched against each other to fight in the king's arena. The storyline about tigers in the wild and what can happen to them is somewhat ok. It is not a totally cheerful movie, but I did enjoy the parts where the tiger cubs were being brothers, and the ending. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:48, Rated PG) (5/10)

Permalink",True,"I have gone through all of the 120 reviews after seeing this beautiful movie.

All has been said before. Yes, I was very moved too. Yes, I was shocked too. I admired the beautiful nature & wildlife and got angry at 1900's behavior of Mankind.

If you take your children to go see a movie, you should inform before. Especially if you buy the DVD, you should view it rapidly before showing it to your kids. You should be aware of the time spirit too. This is called taking responsibility. Don't come complaining afterwards...

JJ Annaud did a very good job. The film does not disturb by its cruelty to animals, it disturbs because reality is shown.

Not one of the 120 reviewers noted - or mentioned - a very interesting scene at the beginning of the film. A locals says ""this statue is too heavy"" and Aidan McRory (Guy Pierce) replies ""just cut the head""... Many of those statues - or parts of it - are now not only in musea, but also in houses of ""normal"" people around the globe... Why didn't anyone notice this? JJ Annaud only shows reality: we, westerns (UK, FR...) just plundered the colonies & so called protectorates, and started to kill the wildlife at a big scale. This is reality. Maybe not a film to go see with young children, if you want them to ignore what really happened/happens in this world.

I gave it a 10/10, for a lot of reasons. The main one being, it made me think about what we are doing to this planet.

Great cinematography and a winner soundtrack to go along with a wonderful story. Basically the story of brotherly love from the point of view of tigers. Fates separated these young cubs and destiny brought them back together to rebond in perhaps not the most pleasant circumstances. This movie , showed how people treat animals and not in such a favorable way. Of course , I knew this and it was sad none the less. Family bonding ,uplifting and some great animal training to make this movie flourish. This was an animated Disney movie ala Lion King, though not the same plot, brought to real life. Simply a brilliant story and one that can hopefully , drill into peoples heads that animals , have feelings and desires just like humans. Nature should be celebrated not halted and this film, teaches wonderful lessons.

Permalink",False,"I rented this film a few weeks ago but then I (and the family) liked it so much I bought it over the internet, as it is a film to keep and which can be seen every now and then, by young and adults alike. Why? So many reasons. The tigers are, of course, a treat to watch (what beautiful eyes !); the plot is cleverly woven, heading to the climax, and still keeping our attention till the closing scenes. There are many dramatic moments, and some of them are really moving. The characters are all given depth, whether it is the local dignitary (""his excellency"") or the French commander, or the circus people, even though the character played by Guy Pearce is quite enigmatic, being a professional hunter and emotional and good-hearted at the same time. The cinematography is extremely well crafted; the film does not have a hectic pace which is a relief considering how films are edited these days, and practically all the actors, including the child, deliver fine performances. The film can also be interpreted in ecological terms, giving a further dimension to this high quality entertainment. Five stars !

Permalink",False,"Superb. I had to give my girlfriend a bowl because she said the cubs were so cute she felt sick.

A really heart warming story of 2 baby tigers who get separated when they are young and grow up in 2 different environments. Guy Pierce plays a great role and works excellently with the cubs. One grows up as a pet and another in a circus. One is very docile and shy, whereas the other is very outgoing and boisterous. There is a great scene where they want to cross the river but don't want to get wet. So they jump onto the backs of tortoises and wait for them to walk across the river. Unfortunately one gets stuck in the middle of the river and the other falls off. Classic scenes like this are all the way throughout.

Later in the film my favorite scene is where the hungry tigers find a lorry with some food on it and hijack it. And while eating all the meat one starts pressing his paw on the horn and beeping all the people running away. You laugh so hard you are on the verge of tears.

Its not only a family film but one for all age groups. I don't normally buy DVD's but I bought this as soon as I saw it. It can be seen over and over again, and still be as funny and touching."

Permalink",False,"No one thinks anything about wild horses being domesticated. We ride them. Or cattle. We eat them, as well as pigs and sheep. Don't make me go off on chickens that live boxed existences till their heads are lopped off. And take house cats; they are not like dogs. Man has never quite bred all their instinct from them. That's why they still hunt mice and birds. The difference with lions and tigers, which are smarter than house cats, is that we don't eat them. We can't ride them. They are no good for pulling machinery. They can only be used to do tricks or to watch. And as tame as they might become from being raised from cubs, they cannot understand their own strength, nor the fact that humans do not have thick enough skin to withstand their teeth the same as their kind. When Roy of Siegfried and Roy was mauled by his pet tiger, everyone thought it had attacked him. Rather, it was trying to protect him by carrying him off stage. It just could not understand that what would work for one of its cubs would kill a human being. The bottom line is that it is not about lions or tigers being left to their own in the wild; it's all about real estate and the fact that we are not willing to allow them free reign as hunters over ""our"" planet. In the end, the only lions or tigers that survive will be the ones kept in zoos. But the truth is that a lion or tiger that grows up in a human environment is no more or less happy or unhappy than a horse that is raised on a ranch or a farm. The life that it has grown up into is all that it knows. What is cruel, on the other hand, is taking an intelligent wild animal and forcing it to live in a cage."

Permalink",False,"I watched Two Brothers and I loved it. It shows how people in the old days (as well as some people in the present day) don't know anything about wildlife and environmental protection. All they care is about progress and development of real estate without regard for preservation.

Humans can not have everything in the world. Tigers attack humans because they are protecting their territory and wild animals do anything hostile for the sake of survival. Any animal needs to eat so any potential food can be prey.

Humans can distinguish good from bad, we have our own judgment and initiative. And this makes us, Humans, the most dangerous animal in the world.

The Tigers stole the show, but the hunter and the little boy weren't far behind them. Am recommending this movie to everyone, friends, family and strangers. Been years since I have loved a movie so much. The tigers on screen are large and their roaring could scare, the pointing of the gun was scary, but with all the violent, sex filled movies that are being made this one is more than worth the price of the ticket.

Permalink",False,"Guy Pearce was effective as the hunter Aidan McRory, the movie was realistic for the most part yet hopeful towards the end...

The Administrator and his oily obsequeisms to the Oriental Excellency were all too real for that time of the world's history, as for the village headman's playing both ends against the middle to survive was all too typical of what then called Indochine by the French at that time...

Kumar and Sangha were endearing and ironic, the brave one became passive as a pawn of the Circus/System; while Sangha the gentle became fierce at being rejected by the Colony/System for him exhibiting his nature when cornered by that pestilential dog ""Bitsy"" - he was defending himself! I thought the cub should've been given a medal! ;oD

His Excellency it seems is not quite the son his father envisioned him to be - but then if he sent his son away for British education, is he really supposed to come back with the same taste for blood as his father had? He tried to be what he was not and that is why he failed to kill the 2 bros' mother!

While it was noble for the two brothers to recognise each other after all that time - which for a semi-feral creature is a while indeed - I doubt that that really would be the case in reality, more's the pity!

The end was rather sweet but fanciful, again -- would Mom know them after all this time? Would she not have found a new mate and more cubs by then??

The direction and cinematography involving the massive felines was beautiful, they were so convincing they almost looked as though they were talking, e.g. when Sangha dragged on the tiger-net and his Mom cuffed him for making a ruckus or when Kumar encouraged Sangha to leap over the wall of fire...

So, if you do take kids to this either before, after or both... explain the true story of taming wild animals to keep as pets!"

Permalink",True,"I thought the story was OK since I like animals. I like watching animal shows on discovery and if you like that, then you'd probably like this movie. It's about 2 tiger cubs who lose their parents and get separated. One is taken to a side show circus while the other gets to live in a house as a boy's pet. Eventually the pet tiger gets sold to someone who fights tigers. And fate brings the 2 tigers together in a fight and they recognize each other. They are able to escape and are given a chance to live in the jungle by they boy and guy who found the cubs to begin with. The 2 tigers have a happy ending.

This has some great shot so tigers and cubs. They are the stars not people.

FINAL VERDICT: If you like animals, I recommend it.

Permalink",True,"""Two Brothers"" is one of those films that you really want to like. It has a beautiful message, a decent story and two beautiful tigers as the leads. It shows mans' cruelty to animals, either for sport, or for no good reason at all. It has good camera work, fantastic scenery. And they did a real nice job of minimizing the animal violence that we see.

Unfortunately, it does not have an interesting story. Yes it is predictable with absolutely no surprises along the way. There are the requisite bad guys, some who, of course, become good guys somewhere along the way. The mandatory precocious child is on hand, as well as the fumbling, incompetent government official. You understand what all this is building up to, right? Not much. None of the characters are particularly interesting. Even Guy Pearce, who is usually very good, isn't given enough to do with his role.

This is a movie that could have and should have been much better than it was. It was just not that interesting.

Permalink",True,"I think the most obvious to reason to see this film is for the tigers, young and old, they are magnificent creatures, and here they are the main focus, from director Jean-Jacques Annaud (The Name of the Rose, Enemy at the Gates). Basically two twin tigers, one shy and gentle, the other bold and fierce, are born in the ruins of a temple in an exotic jungle. However, one day the brothers are separated by fate, the bold tiger, named Kumal is sold to a circus, his homesickness and cage life have taken away his spirit, while his brother, named Sangha, is still with his mother. Kumal is trained to do tricks by cruel ringmaster Zerbino (Vincent Scarito), and soon Sangha is also captured, and they are put in a stage together, meant to be fighting, but thank goodness they recognise each other, all grown up that is, and they escape. Oh, I should mention, the man who has appeared a lot during the tigers' lives is famous hunter Aidan McRory (Memento's Guy Pearce), who by the way, killed their mother, but he respects the tigers freedom, and in the end gives up hunting. Also starring Jean-Claude Dreyfus as Administrator Eugene Normandin, Finding Neverland's Freddie Highmore as Raoul Normandin, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu as Mrs. Normandin, Stéphanie Lagarde as Miss Paulette, Maï Anh Le as Naï-Rea, Moussa Maaskri as Saladin and Oanh Nguyen as His Excellency, the Prince. For the cute factor, this film is very entertaining, and the story is quite good too, to be honest, you can't really pay attention to much else besides the tigers. Worth watching!

As an animal lover, especially wildlife, I found this movie to be totally enthralling. It's a story, and quite a good one. The animal action was very good, credos to the trainer, and to the beautiful tigers. The acting was excellent, with the players exhibiting social norms from the early 20th century, making it a good period piece.

Guy Pearce made a good central character, as he always does.

The story is touching, and I confess it had me a bit tearful during especially tense scenes.

The interaction between the people and the tigers is unforgettable.

The camera work and the top notch editing gave the film its life.

Permalink",False,"Few wildlife movies have touched me as this one. Surely, it is a moving capture of the great cat in captivity as contrasted with its natural ambushes. The movie arouses your soul to feel what it means to lose freedom and habitat, and in this the film makers have been masterfully successful. A hunter's prowling mind is seen sharply focused against a child's disarming spontaneity. The scenes unfold at the same pace as Kumal and Sangha grow up and run into their different destinies. There is lurking danger from the first day the cubs are delivered into this world even as the siblings reveal their strangely exotic ways while events progressively cumulate. Much down-to-earth fun and hilarity are also to be experienced in the episodes amongst the tribesmen or at the administrator's demesne with young Raoul or in some royal banality. The riotous canvas of green and yellow that fills the screen throughout beckons the eyes at once to look within and question whether cruelty and lust for lucre must at all survive Nature or should fraternal and filial love reign supreme in her wild reserves.

Permalink",True,"Beatifuly shot film with an important message. Two brothers is a story about two infant tigers who become separated when their mother is killed by a hunter.Kumal is the more aggressive and Sangha is the quiet one.And towards the end of the film the cubs personalities reverse. Kumal gets put in a circus and has his spirit knocked out of him,whereas Sangha grows up in a house with a kind little boy only to find he out grows the house and ends up put into another type of circus.By this point he has become a true fighter and is fearless. When they are almost fully grown they are cruelly pitted against each other in a Gladiator style arena where they are to fight to the death.At first they don't recognise each other and they start to fight,then suddenly they make eye contact smell each other and realise they are brothers. They then escape from the arena and make their way back to the jungle and eventually the ending is a happy one. I think this film is suitable for all ages and has some very beautiful moments such as when Sangha as a young cub sits on the little boys toy shelf and makes himself look like one of the toys.The film has many moments like this. Man is clearly the enemy in this film as tigers have been hunted to near extinction,at the end of the film there's some credits that tell us that in the 1900's there were 100,000 tigers in the world,now days there are less than 5000 and they are getting fewer,some species of tiger are already extinct. I hope that the message of this film will get people to help save this magnificent endangered animal.

This is also an very emotional film for it depicts how cruel can humans be, and the moral of it all is to reserve wildlife and give these magnificent animals one more chance on this planet.

Permalink",False,"""Two Brothers"" is sheer film-making. Annuad is one of the only directors who can pull off a film where two animals are the lead characters. Like ""The Bear"", dialogue isn't primarily important to letting the story unravel. Annaud, as Kubrick did in his best works, focuses on his sound, striking visuals and sturdy plot to tell his story.

Using crisp, high definition DV, his most recent film is one that leaps forward, but respects the past. Annaud creates a visual atmosphere that breaks apart from most conventional films. His story similarly takes strides away from convention. It's parts are loosely structured, but beautifully interwoven. I was very much reminded of his 1992 film ""The Lover"" from a story that floats through a wonderfully thought out path without feeling like any story ever told.

""Two Brothers"" is about a pair of baby tigers who are separated from their father and eventually each other. The grasp of humanity constantly pulls them apart and takes them away from their natural and loving environment. The use of two tigers as lead characters is humble and symbolic in itself. Annaud's message communicated, through the different sections of the film, is that we must respect animals like tigers (who are dwindling in existence) enough to coexist with them.

A pivotal character in the film is a famous, revered big game hunter played with charm, equanimity and excellence by Guy Pearce. His transformation in character is the centerpiece in which the film's main messages revolve around. He is a learned, realistic man, nothing of a dreamer, who strives for understanding of himself and his actions after he bonds with one of the brothers named Songa.

This is an excellent film! Jean Jaques Annaud is in top form with a severely underrated, but strikingly important feature. Not only a big improvement over the dull ""Enemy at the Gates"", but also a crowning moment in his career, ""Two Brothers"" is a must see movie!"

The story is quite simply but it doesn't stop this film from being really good. The acting by the human actors is very good, especially by Guy Pearce and the acting by the two tigers superb. Maybe the Academy Awards should start a new category. Best Animal performance of the year. =)

Jokes aside, this film is truly for everybody, from the youngest child to the oldest man. The cinematography is just straight through awesome and the picture a real joy to watch.

Permalink",False,"Although I instinctively recoil at any attempt by filmmakers to convert majestic animals into little more than furry, four-legged human beings, I had hoped that director Jean-Jacques Annaud would be able to avoid that pitfall in ""Two Brothers,"" a tale of two tiger cubs who become separated for a year, only to be reunited when they are each fully grown. Instead, Annaud goes for broke in making these two magnificent creatures as human as is humanly possible, rendering them far less interesting in the process.

Upon their separation, one of the little ones gets carted off to a local circus where he is mistreated by his sadistic handlers, while the other is adopted as a pet by a young boy, the son of a local administrator. Then, once the tiger gets to be too big and too difficult to handle, he is sent to be part of a menagerie belonging to a spoiled prince who wants to turn him into a fearsome fighting beast. Guy Pearce plays a pragmatic but tender-hearted hunter/black marketeer whose life path intersects with those of the cubs throughout the course of the story, and whose character transformation is one of the least believable aspects of a film that is not all that rooted in credibility to begin with.

Admittedly, Annaud does an impressive job getting up close and personal with the tigers, and he certainly has an amazing ability to get these wild beasts to do what he wants them to do on camera. Unfortunately, just about everything he has them do smacks of anthropomorphic phoniness, essentially depriving them of their true nature as creatures of instinct and not calculation. As this is a family-oriented film, we get none of that National Geographic unpleasantness of the tigers tracking down and devouring their helpless prey. In fact, we wonder just what these animals eat in the course of a day to keep themselves so fit and healthy. The director also lays it on a bit thick with all his soulful close-ups of the tigers, particularly when they are cubs, looking just too sad-eyed and adorable for words. In addition, Annaud simply can't resist throwing in numerous scenes of lowbrow slapstick to show just what fun-loving roustabouts these dear little tigers are.

The film also suffers from a serious technical problem. I'm not sure what kind of camera Annaud used to film his scenes, but the picture tends to become very blurry every time either the camera moves or a figure moves in the frame. Given the number of shots of tigers racing across the screen, this visual imperfection becomes a serious detriment indeed.

I guess that if one views ""Two Brothers"" as a fantasy film of sorts, it makes the whole enterprise somehow easier to swallow. For me, I think I'll stick to National Geographic and the Discovery Channel and leave the animal fantasy stuff to Disney."

Permalink",False,"Two brothers (Jean-Jacques Annaud) From his previous movies we know JJ Annaud loves to make movies about nature, people and history.

Although this is certainly not his best movie, he manages to make people think about what he makes. Here about the steeling of artifacts and killing of wild animals in foreign colonies.

First of all, its a movie about two brother tigers, who s parents are hunted because tigers kill. In this, not really defined place (somewhere India or Bangladesh) they kill people and domestic animals (buffels).

When Aidan McRory (Guy Pearce), who plays a man who steels authentic artifacts from the forests, kills the mother-or father of the two small tigers (not defined), the two brothers are brought to two different places.

At that time the place is controlled by French politicians who have a colony in the region, and one of those high ranked officer s son gets a tiger. The other one is sold to a circus, as a vicious tiger. The first one is making really trouble and is sold to the head of the colony who has several fierce animals in his dungeon.

After a year they are brought together to fight to each-other. But the two brothers recognize each other and wont fight and escape.

In general not bad, but the visual effect could be done a lot better and off course in such sentimental films the script is made for children to understand.

A feel good movie.

They meet kind animal-loving people along the way but are frequently dragged away from these people as well for their entertainment value. The story is often showed from the animals' point of view and it makes for some very touching scenes. The end is the clincher.

Permalink",True,"When watching the Two Brothers film, written by Alan Godard and director Jean-Jacque's Annaud, I was captivated by the story of the two tiger cubs and their journey home. The Two Brothers film is a great film, but not for younger children because of the films story development and violence toward the animals. In this acclaimed family film two twin tiger cubs live in a temple until treasure hunters find the temple, after they do the brothers get separated. One of the treasure hunters, Aiden McRory (Guy Pearce) kills the male parent tiger and finds one of the cubs. The cub was then sold to the circus and named Kumal, the blood thirsty tiger. The other cub is then found by the governor's son Raoul (Freddie Highmore) and names him Sangha. After years of adapting to their new life and becoming adults, they are reunited in an unfortunate circumstance. Their only choices had caused them, Kumal and Sangha, to escape captivity and terrorize the Village. For the fear of hurting someone, Aiden McRory is then asked to kill the two tigers. Although, as the two brothers are almost home a wall of fire stops them. Kumal and Sangha's only chance to survive and escape is to jump over through the wall of fire to get back to the temple and reunite with their mother. Two Brothers is one of my favorite movies. I say this because not only did it have tigers as the stars of the movie, but it was also very engaging. Throughout the story, the two tigers show the emotion and the pain they were going through in each scene. It made you feel as if you can really connect with them and understand where they are coming from within the movie. From the beginning, it shows that tigers are not the antagonist, humans are. Every time I see this movie I burst into tears, it is so heartfelt and it fills you with the same emotions you get while ending on cliff hangers. You keep wanting more, wanting to be a part of it. Jean-Jacque's Annaud did an amazing job directing the movie, but I feel as tough the human actors could have shown more emotion when the tigers reunite. The tiger showed more emotion than Guy Pearce and Freddie Highmore. Guy Pearce didn't seem sad to see Kumal in a cage. Freddie Highmore could have thrown a tantrum when Sangha got taken from him. When watching the film look at the body language and eyes of the tigers. One can tell the tiger is afraid when its ears are flat against its head and the eyes are wide.

Most family movies don't show blood or a lot of violence, but some family films should be for adults only. After Kumal and Sangha are separated and live in cages for the first year of their lives and exposed to nothing but hatred and hostility by humans. Violence toward the tigers in the film may give children the wrong idea on how to treat animals. Kids like to act like what they see in the movies. When Aiden McRory killed the father tiger, it was hard to watch. Even though this scene is essential to the story of the Two Brothers. This shows how the two are separated and their story of the two brothers begins. I feel this movie is more for adults because the cruelty this movie shows toward the tigers. As a result, the Two Brothers movie is a great film. The tigers make the film realistic and intriguing. This should not be a family because of the content. I would highly recommend to adult animal lovers.

Permalink",False,"Two Brothers is an absolutely rounding success, due primarily due to it's mature handling of a touching family story and the fact that it's such a technical accomplishment to have executed such well trained animal dynamics that have a successful variation between majestic and adorable.

Two Brothers amazed me in 2 parts. One was due to the fact that the achievement of training animals to work so immaculately is just an incredible achievement because the use of real animals in lieu of the visual effects that films today are fairly reliant on is excellent in making Two Brothers seem like nothing short of a true story, and it's so stunning that I cried within the first twenty minutes because the sound and sight of an actual little tiger cub crying for it's family and struggling to run from human oppressors just hit me all too hard. The masterful technical achievements in Two Brothers is enough to watch it and the passionate effort of the filmmakers guided by the stunning direction of Jean-Jacques Annaud ensures that Two Brothers is a breakthrough in the animal adventure genre and is all to stunningly realistic to pass up. Plus, the musical score is all too excellent and the cinematography was stunning, as well as the exceptionally beautiful locations it was all filmed on.

The other part is the simple fact that I just loved the story and the adventure of this movie, as well as the fact that the tigers were so adorable as cubs and majestic as adults and so it was just a treat to witness, and at times it was funny. The entire cast was also talented, especially a young Freddie Highmore. And it's impossible not to get so attached to the animals because they're all such beautiful creatures that have been mistreated for so long, and as the end if the film reveals it's gotten to the point where the number of Tigers has decreased from 100,000 to less than 5000. So Two Brothers raises a powerful moral point as well as being just as stunning adventure about brotherhood and animal life, and wad significantly more beautiful than I could have predicted and is an absolutely unforgettable experience that I vastly enjoyed."

Permalink",True,"""Two Brothers"" is truly an obscure animal in the wild. For animal lovers out there, this movie is not designed for the younger age group, but could also garner some thoughts towards the adult demographics as well. Aside from the stars of the movie being two adorable tiger cubs, the human cast are also very provocative in terms of performances and neither humans or animals ever once try to upstage one another.

Even though he's known for starring in more serious fare like ""Memento"" and ""A Slipping Down Life"", British actor Guy Pearce plays the role of prized hunter, thrill-seeker and successful treasurer Aidan McRory from the French Indochina (Cambodia) in the 1920's who's becomes an integral part in the tiger cubs' lives. However, Pearce understands that he's in the supporting role here and that his status as an A-list performer has no place for a film of this magnitude.

The first part of this movie centers around the character development of the two cubs Kumal and Sangha. Kumal is the more adventurous one while Sangha is the more stronger minded cub and we watch as they are sadly separated after humans invade on their domain as each of them watch as their father was savagely killed. In sure irony, Kumal was rescued by McRory. However, his good intentions gets him arrested on account of looting on archaeological premises in which Kumal gets adopted to a gypsy circus and while Sangha becomes a pet to kind young boy, only to become trained to be bad-ass killer thanks to the emperor's royal zookeeper.

Cut to a year later, they are reunited in a not so friendly way as they become sparring partner's in the emperor's fighting ring, and cleverly and amusingly, they found an escape to which McRory tries to track them down as they caused fear and chaos in the village. McRory explains that even though they have no fear in humankind, they're not inclined to kill. They're primary targets for prey are women and children.

Written and directed by Annaud, we visualize a sensitive and nurturing tale in which animal integrity and and human needs clash in ways that's hardly ever been accomplished before in rather unfamiliar territory. Sure the dialogue is quite meagre (duh! tigers don't talk) but this film raises topics like imperialism, nobility and even ecological issues like environment, animal rights, deforestation, declining of species all while avoiding from being preachy about it. And these important scenes are the reasons this movie truly stands above the rest.

Another good thing about this movie is that there were no real antagonists in this story. The closest we have to bad guys were the tyrannical circus trainers, the deviant administrator (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) and the sophisticated emperor (Oanh Nguyen) and even they don't have any real evil intentions.

But also the tigers have no real evil intentions either. I'm no animal trainer, but the performances by the tigers were easily some of the best I've seen in any film that stars an animal. These felines don't just depend on instinct and dumb-luck irony in their escape from the human world, they also convey expressions, emotions and never feels forced or contrived. Their expressions just comes from their eyes because cats can't show expression from their eyes.

If there was one flaw about this movie was that Annaud nixes stock and digital video which ruins the style of the movie. The digital camera-work depicted here not only feels out of place it also looks very cheap. There may have been some sacrificial cutbacks of the film, but that's no excuse why the jungle landscapes and the ancient ruins where the twin cubs resided had to be digitized.

But the failed camera-work doesn't hinder the story about a species who's population is dying off. It's an interesting story filled with adventure, intellectual integrity and though it feels like a kids film, the adults can also be intrigued by the story with questions relating to environmental issues. Though it's rated PG, there are intense moments.

Permalink",False,"Yay Universal Pictures!

I loved Two Brothers. The cruel invasion of man and his industry destroying the tiger population is represented well in this family rated flick. The gratuitous violence and slaughter of tigers isn't ignored or removed from the story in any way. The frightening and saddening scenes only seemed graphic, but were cleverly edited to leave the images of blood and maiming solely in the viewer's imagination and not on the actual screen. Though I found my eyes tearing up and wanting to sob a few times for the poor creatures, I had to remind myself I was watching a movie made to invoke such feelings.

There weren't any phony noticeable animatronics, or if there were robot actors, I never caught them. Virtually every shot of the the tigers seemed natural, and the ones that seemed too perfect and too good to be real were just beautiful anyway. When you have such beautiful source material as a Tiger to work from, you'd better make it true to the original in a CGI movie-making world. Don't mess with perfection! You're sucked into empathy for these creatures with every close up shot of their faces, you could see the emotion and reaction in the tigers' faces in great detail and I think that's what made the movie so enthralling. I can only imagine the hundreds of hours of footage that had to be shot in order to capture the animal acting that's shown in the final cut, as well as what I'm sure was a heavy task of matte work and layering in the effects departments. But the director and editor and all involved should definitely be commended and recognized for these well-put together scenes.

Two Brothers isn't a watered-down Disney-fluff animal picture like Homeward Bound, or a Warner Brothers piece of crap like the Free Willy franchise or the Panda-crap Adventure. No, Universal generally goes for the more serious, true-to-real-life story as shown in Two Brothers. You don't feel like your getting lied to; Tigers have been hunted and slaughtered to endangered species proportions. You're brought to understand this very clearly throughout course of this movie.

Take someone you can hang onto occasionally when things get tense for our Tiger friends. You'll find yourself going ""Awwwww!"" and ""Noooo!!!"" and ""Mmmnnggee!"" and ""GASP!"" and ""Awwwwww!"" again. You'll need the support of a loved one nearby, or you may find yourself crying on the shoulder of the complete stranger sitting next to you.

5 out of 5 Royal Crowns. A wonderful flick and I want it in my DVD collection right now. *nods*"

highly recommended and beautiful film.

Permalink",False,"I've only seen the trailer once, but it was enough to decide to view it. I didn't expect much about the story because the two main characters were tiger cubs, who would face each other in an arena as adults. So you can imagine the story to be slow. Also, the movie wasn't to fantastic, I just can't stand movies were children or animals are (almost) flawless heroes. At the end of the movie I felt really for the tigers that didn't make it, but the catharsis made up for them. It's a great movie, the main human characters were stereotypes, but it gave a bigger contrast with the tigers. I can only recommend this movie to everybody! But animal-lovers beware, some scenes are the saddest I've ever seen.

Permalink",True,"JJ Annaud with Two Brother tried to renew his success from L'Ours, aka The Bear, but sadly failed. First, the same theme as in L'Ours is used... two worlds are confronted; The animals, painted with harmony, brotherhood, and peace; and the humans world, described as corrupted, and evil. Now that we have the same subject as ""L'Ours""...remove the bears, put 2 tigers instead, got a new movie! The result is 2hours of boredom, an incredible amount of cuts during the tiger scenes (which really gets annoying..)and a story that gets completely senseless, that can't take off and carry you away. Totally awkward.I stopped watching at half of it. If you want to see a good animal movie, watch L'Ours from the same Director.It's a Great movie.

Permalink",False,"For some reason then I had actively been avoiding ""Two Brothers"" (aka ""Deux Frères""). Why? Well, I had been under the assumption that it was a children's movie, given the DVD cover.

But I sat down to watch the movie one evening, and it turned out that this was actually a rather nice surprise of a movie. Because it was a beautifully shot movie in many ways - from the cinematography, to the setting of the movie, to the two majestic tigers that starred in it.

Storywise, then briefly summarized it is about two tiger cubs taken from their mother. They are parted and brought up very differently, one having a life of hardships and cruelty at the hands of circus people, while the other is pampered at the hands of a rich family, serving as an exotic pet.

""Two Brothers"" is a movie that is fully wholesome, and watchable for the entire family, kids and adults alike. It is the type of movie that has a bit of something for just about everybody. There is action, there is sadness, there is joy, there is excitement, there are majestic animals, there are friendships between different species.

I was especially impressed with how they had trained the tigers, because they were performing quite well.

This was a nice surprise of a movie that actually proved worth sitting down to watch. It is quite suitable for an evenings worth of family entertainment.

As for my vote, well, I am rating ""Two Brothers"" a seven out of ten stars."

Permalink",False,"If you're out to demonstrate that animals are better than people (better scene-stealers, anyhow) then by all means, make 'Two Brothers' your prize exhibit. Just as the 'Incredible Journey' showed us decades beforehand, animals, when given the right elbow room, are simply fantastic when it comes to film. They have the power to transform minimal, routine story lines (two tiger cub siblings are divided from their mother, removed from the wild by separate parties of high-handed humans, grow up in different captive grounds and finally find themselves pitted against each other in the battle ringokay, I'm sure we all know where this one's going, sweet and warm-hearted as it is  it's essentially little more than a variation on the story of Androcles and the lion, in which both protagonists, on this occasion, are creatures of the wilderness) into gripping, engaging and dazzling delights, simply by being animals acting in their animal ways. Kumal and Sangha, the two big cats here, are certainly no exception to the custom. They're expressive, appealing and a pleasure to watch in whatever stage of their growth  whether as wide-eyed, adorable cubs, or beautiful, majestic adults, they bring a real magic to the story that keeps it afloat and mesmerising, and if, like me, you're an avid animal lover, the odds are you'll fall completely in love with these beasts and everything they stand for. It's refreshing to know, certainly, that not every animal-orientated flick aimed at the family market nowadays has to rely on smarmy human voice-overs and overdone special effects (of all the movies spawned by that phenomenon over the past decade or so, only 'Babe', their much-loved pioneer, had the charm or the subtlety to pull it off convincingly) to communicate the thoughts and feelings of its four-legged cast. 'Two Brothers' has enough trust in these tigers provide all that with their physical mannerisms alone, and there's something about their muted composure that makes them seem all the more innocent and vulnerable as a result. As far as the animals go, it's neither too complex for kids or too childish for adults. All ages are free to enjoy.

A lot less interesting are the endless human characters who continually step in to shape the structure of the story but, with their lacklustre dialogue and minimal development, totally pale when it comes to screen presence. And this is where all age groups, young and old alike, are liable to find boredom. Unlike 2003's 'Seabiscuit', which took enough interest in the various people surrounding its titular equine to even go as far as allowing them to steal the spotlight from him, the humans never amount to much more here than a parade of one-dimensional caricatures (the insensitive circus trainers, the cosmopolitan child, the ignorant game hunter, and so forth). Guy Pearce has easily bagged himself the most substantial role of the lot, being the only one who actually finds himself in something of a dilemma over his position  growing unexpectedly attached to Kumal, the particular cub he personally abducted, when his most highly-commended talent lies in his flair for hunting out and destroying the creatures  which in turn does bring in a little emotional pay-off. It's a notch more interesting, at any rate, than Sangha's simultaneous story, concerning his bonding with the young son of a local governor (which, on its own, doesn't have a huge deal to distinguish it from any number of your generic 'boy and his  insert species here  story'). Though, to be fair, the scenes between the tigers themselves aren't completely spotless  what probably should have ranked as the most powerful and gut-wrenching sequence in the film, that is, the showdown in the arena, in practice actually feels very rushed and docile.

Still, the good intentions in this one always shine and, in spite of the problems mentioned above (or possibly in some small way because of) the central message, that the true spirit of nature has the potential to always prevail above humanity's short-sighted efforts to curb and control it, is still nicely delivered. And, in addition to the lovable critters and beautiful scenery, it has Stephen Warbeck's enthralling score to do it justice; three factors which all combine to produce a wonderful viewing experience when left to their own devices. The half-hearted humans and their token character arcs, which insist on barging in and disrupting this, ensure that 'Two Brothers' comes nowhere close to being a masterpiece, but it's a perfectly satisfactory piece of family entertainment that's not afraid to wear its heart upon its sleeve. Worth a look if you're an animal enthusiast, or just in need of a good old-fashioned, straightforward romp.

Grade: B+"

Permalink",False,"I normally don't bother with ""family"" movies. I have found them trite at best and encouragers of social conformity at worst. Not this one! True, some of the tiger behaviors depicted aren't accurate. The picture of 1920's colonial life in Vietnam is largely sanitized. But if we suspend disbelief, Two Brothers is the classic animal story: two tiger littermates are separated by humans and of course, reunited as adults with lots of complications and cute animal scenes along the way. But the script is quite literate for this type of story. The photography is lovely and the animal scenes, while staged of course, do not appear to be. It's also refreshing to see very little obvious CGI in this movie! Guy Pearce elevates the script as an author-big game hunter-antiquities thief who learns to appreciate both nature and cultural diversity. The story is not overly violent or upsetting for children while not being too dumbed-down for parents. And there's a gentle plug at the end for tiger preservation.

As nature movies go it's not The Bear (same director) or Walkabout, but it is what it is. I'd recommend Two Brothers for families with children of almost any age. 8 out of 10 for this purpose and get the DVD, your kids will want to see this many times."

Permalink",True,"I think this movie is very special. Dramatically it is a successful story; we watching are being taught a valuable lesson about savouring life. The movie is supposed to appeal to both children and adults as do most U ratings I think, but Two Brothers does this especially well by giving the two brothers human allies, one adult and one child. Interestingly the child 'Raoul' befriends the beast that grows to be most ferocious. There is much beauty to feast upon in Two Brothers but there are fright elements, comedy, drama, suspense, thrill, romance; it is such a well rounded story. There is also a constant squabbling conflict between what is more important; human history and tradition or The animal Kingdom, the Jungle, what grows up around us and lives with us. It is interesting to see that humans seem to destroy both civilisation and nature. But the two protagonists of this film change many mind-sets without words. Pretty Cool. If I ever have children I would like them to see this movie.

This movie was for me really emotional ! I watched it on my own, and when my mother came to take a look what I was doing she was like 'why are you crying?'. And I have got to admit : I never cried for a movie since Bambi and Air bud !

It was also hard and difficult for me to watch this movie, *spoliers* especially the scenes in the circus ! But at the end, everything's fine, and those awful feelings disappear when you know everything's gonna be fine ;-) *end spoilers*

Permalink",False,"I totally understand why this movie was made; it's message is obvious. The scenes with the tigers are beautifully shot, too, and the location work is sumptuous. Still, there is something patently wrong-headed about the drama of this effort. Perhaps it was the Guy Pierce character. He's such an annoying cliché we learn little about, as are the greasy circus folk. His character arc was so predictable. I certainly felt for the fates of the animals, but I cared not one iota for Pierce, a hunter and cultural thief who slowly ""reforms"" and learns to put his gun down.

I am a big fan of director Annaud's THE BEAR and found that to be a virtually perfect movie. Not so TWO BROTHERS, unfortunately, with its incredibly predictable plotting and thickly layered stereotypes.

The movie is beautifully structured internally with lots of symmetry.

The viewer is presented with reasons for respecting nature *AND* culture. Sadly, we do neither.

The specials on the DVD are just excellent. They are really worth watching!!! The explanations of animatronics was fascinating, and the work with the tigers of various ages was enlightening. Also, the netting and protection.

Permalink",True,"This is probably one of the more accessible (and entertaining) movies about animal conservation catered to those of young and old. The DVD contains wonderful extras about Tigers and educating thus forth. The movie builds an awareness and sense of caring for creatures otherwise unknown to many (at least on a somewhat intimate level). It shows how humans used to be and how some still are. It also expresses growth and concern for other things around us (ie. the tigers and national treasures).

I know some may say there is an inappropriate ""intimate"" scene but this is nature folks, not invincible bubble world where storks deliver children. It doesn't even show this scene long enough for great comprehension. So please don't avoid it because of this.

I highly recommend.

The middle part of the movie does pick up a bit and follows us through what happens to the cubs after taken from the jungle. The end is quite well paced as there is a lot going on and a lot of excitement. Throughout the movie you just can't help but hate the humans for how they treat the poor tigers. I found myself talking to the screen and telling them to kill the humans in the circus. Although there was not much in the way of bloodshed, the hostility presented by both sides was well portrayed. This movie should be shown to children to let them see what sadly really does happen in the world. As I, many adults will also find this to be a surprisingly good movie when given the chance.

Permalink",False,"This movie, ""Two Brothers"" is magnificent! The script/storyline is great, the acting on the part of the Tigers is absolutely amazing, and best of all, you leave the movie theater with a smile on your face! I must warn you however: This movie contains scenes that depict violence towards Animals. Of course, the Animals in the movie aren't really hurt, but when you realize that things that happen in the movie actually go on in this cruel world that we live in, it will be sobering. You may actually hate the human race a little after seeing this movie. But, thankfully, a couple of humans redeem themselves (atleast in the movie they do) by movie's end. The movie begins with the two precious, and beautiful Tiger cubs, Sangha and Kumal, as they frolic and play in the jungle with their parents. Then, as usual, humans come along and ruin all that was once beautiful. The Cubs are separated and learn just how mean humans can really be. But fate had something else in store, that the hunters hadnt counted on.........a beautiful, happy reunion of the Two Brothers that will leave a happy tear in your eye, a nice chill up and down your spine, and best of all, a toasty warm feeling in your Soul. You'll even laugh a few times, too! This movie accomplishes exactly what it set out to do: To make us realize that HUMANS ARE THE TRUE ANIMALS, AND THE TRUE PREDATORS, AND THAT IT'S UP TO US HUMANS WHO HAVE LOVE AND COMPASSION IN OUR SOULS, TO SAVE THESE BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS, FOR ANIMALS ARE GOD'S CHILDREN AS MUCH AS THE HUMAN ANIMAL IS! Tigers are coming closer and closer to becoming extinct, and WE MUST ACT NOW OR THEY WILL BE FOREVER GONE FROM OUR PLANET! We must NOT allow that to happen. How do we prevent it? By treating Animals, like the beautiful, precious Souls that they are. The same Souls that were created from God's loving hands, just like the human animals were. This movie proves that Animal Souls, like human Souls, share love, and that love truly can conquer all!"

Permalink",False,"I've read some of the reviews, and I don't think I went to see the same movie. If you think this is not child friendly, you need to go and see Bambi again.

In a way this is a REAL 'Disney' film. It does have a happy ending. There are tough bits in it, but they are off screen. If anyone thinks you can make a movie about tigers that live physically near humans without showing a dead tiger, then they have absolutely no idea of what life is really like. They probably think food comes from road-side buildings where you press a button and speak your order.

All the 'bad' bits were explained well, the hunting of the animals was out of human fear, the exploitation of them was for money or for status. If you don't understand that then you don't really deserve to have the right to go see movies. It's human nature, It's life. If anyone had a kid that was BADLY upset by this film, they need to go back and look at their parenting skills. They are in danger of bringing up cotton wool wrapped muppets.

Seriously. I watched it with my 7 and 10 year olds, knowing that there were 'bad' bits in it, but they watched it, took it in, and understood most of it. I'd far rather have to explain to my kids some of the finer nuances of this film than let them have a playstation, or a TV in their bedroom.

The worst bits? The anthropomorphism; these are, after all, wild animals. The female parts - there to put the males in a better light...

The best bits? Hide and seek in the boy's bedroom, and the first 'trophy' photo shoot. Loved it!"

Permalink",False,"Alhough this film may be too emotional for young children, I think this film said a lot of wonderful things and supports the humane treatment of animals FULLY. It showed the evils of circus training, yet also the soft side of their trainers. And if you bothered to stay to the end of the credits, it gave a great testimonial for the WWF. Even at the beginning of the ending credits, it encouraged all thinking people to be more mindful of how they treat other species.

I AM vegetarian, and a supporter of PETA, and I think this is one of the most well-done animal movies ever. It was a story that needed to be told, and yet was also sweet, poignant, and entertaining. But I don't necessarily recommend most humans to see it, since they would probably not be able to appreciate it with their closed-minded, limited intelligence.

My daughter left the movie asking me what she could do about stopping the hunt of the magnificent tigers and other endangered animals. If that was not the purpose of the movie, I don't know what is! The movie is not ""Finding Nemo"", but it does make you think, and gives you an opportunity to see these amazing creatures up close. If a movie can get an 8 yr old to want to do anything she can to stop the hunting and help the endangered animals, then it was done right.

Permalink",False,"I thought I was going to see a happy, ""Disneyfied"" movie about two tigers who grew up, romping through the jungle, and who lived happily ever after.

Instead I saw a movie that shows how a population of 700,000 tigers can dwindle to 5,000. This movie was shocking and disturbing--and, at points, I cried. I wondered if, in my lifetime, tigers and rhinos and whales and koalas will become extinct.

The director caught the beauty of the tigers and cuteness of the cubs very well. The sense of family the tigers share is something I've seen in my own housecats.

All in all, a visually beautiful movie, a disturbing movie, a thought-provoking movie.

Because of the implied violence to animals, I would not take a very young child to see this movie, but perhaps a child of 10 or older.

Permalink",False,"What are people complaining about? This movie can make you cry. But for the right reasons. It is touching, sensitive and very animal friendly. Its about the tearful story of 2 beautiful wild animals who spend a wonderful childhood in the jungles and are torn away from their mother and each other by the cruel hunting nature of man. They meet kind animal-loving people along the way but are frequently dragged away from these people as well for their entertainment value. The story is often showed from the animals' point of view and it makes for some very touching scenes. The end is the clincher. They reunite and return to the jungle and even make the hunter see the joy in their return to the habitat. People who complain about their kids crying are shielding them from a touching statement about the preservation of wildlife. Let your children see the movie and grow with it. Its okay to cry because its a beautiful movie about wonderful animals. Get them out of your SUVs with cutesy animation movies running. Show them this movie and make them members of the WWF if you care enough. There is a valuable lesson in this somewhere. I have spent watching many animal movies as a kid and even the happy scenes would make me cry. Today i am a more sensitive, wildlife-aware and activist thanks to that."

Yes, I was disturbed by how badly the tigers were sometimes treated and grateful that no actual abuse was shown, but I was also glad for the opportunity to talk to my two girls, both during the film and after we left, about the correct and humane treatment of animals, wild and/or domestic. Indeed, I felt the evolution of the human characters in the movie from their initial disregard for the welfare of the animals to their ultimate respect for them was well portrayed.

Although not a film for preschool children, I would recommend ""Two Brothers"" to any of my friends and family as a great family film with a much needed message about wild animals and natural environments.

I personally found this to be a very good, and touching family film. It's the kind of film that is very rarely aimed at an American audience, as it teaches love, compassion, and also raises awareness of endangered species. It was a sweet story, even though sad at times. I personally felt good after viewing this film, and I'm an adult. It followed the life of two (absolutely beautiful) tiger cubs as they are separated from each other. What I thought about after viewing it , was how deep a bond between mother/child and brother/brother is, how it's important to be compassionate, and how people need to be aware to live in harmony with nature around them. The film is beautifully made, and the tigers are magnificent. This film, sadly, is not for everyone, so if you're looking for the latest brainless blockbuster, or plot less teen movie with toilet humor, then this is not for you.

Permalink",False,"Two Brothers' was a very well made movie. All the animals in it were fantastic. Ever since I saw a beast with orange and black striped fur, preferably 'tigers' I was always interested with those creatures. All the excellent effects, and real live tiger cubs and regular tigers, dogs, other animals, were just really amazing. I have always wanted to see a movie based on just with real tigers.

This movie was really a real story based on fact about wildlife. You don't see many tigers here on this planet of ours. There are always poachers, hunters, and skin-eyes-teeth craving people that made a bad difference to the well known wildlife.

We have to take care of those wild animals and ensue the world to become very peaceful. Two Brothers really was based on fact. Like I said, poachers and other hunters crave and take pride in killing wild animals.

Okay enough nature talking. But if you love tigers, then Two Brothers would be the best movie for all that do love tigers, just like myself.

I would give the movie rating about 8/10."

This film is portrays the everyday reality that some of these animals face and is made for the sole purpose of us humans getting to know that these kind of things happen everyday, and thus force us to act and stop this abuse. So anyone who can't stand this reality and needs to walk away from the theater because their fairy tale projections are not met, is the ultimate enemy of these beautiful creatures that they wanted to see happy in a first place.

Unlike typical Hollywood trap, this project was made to have you think and act on the basis of information you received, and not to leave the theater smiling like a happy idiot while forgetting all about it two days later. It is film designed to help these animals, and not to have you spend money on useless toys and products associated with this movie, which is a norm for the typical Hollywood fairy tale.

Americans should grow up for once, and realize that the world doesn't revolve around their artificial expectations of warm and fuzzy feelings they are so addicted to."

The irresponsibility and lack of education on the publics part has led to the desecration of tiger habitat and their numbers have suffered accordingly. The only loser coming out of this movie will be the Circus, while the winner will be wildlife refuges. I feel this is a movie which everyone who has a heart or kids should go see and enjoy. 10/10

You would think that the idea of two cute tiger cubs, beautiful scenery and Guy Pearce, would be a sure fire winner. The result is however the exact opposite. Yes we have two cute tiger cubs. The first forty minutes of the film sees there father slaughtered. The cubs separated and subjected to various cruelties.The scenery is beautiful however the film has almost the quality of video tape.There is something just not quite right. Normally guy Pearce gives a great performance, however on this film he simply has a bad day at the office. He attempts an English accent which brings back memories of Dick Van Dykes method actor accent in Mary Poppins. Do not even rent this film on DVD.

On top of this, they personified the animals: in a movie which seemed to be trying convince us it was ""real"", this is not only unbelievable and emotion blackmail, but very unsafe for children. Anyone who has read Yann Martel's fantastic book, The Life of Pi, will know what I mean. Animals are *animals* and do not behave like humans. In a fantastic world, such as that created by the jungle book, this is easier to accept as fiction.

I definitely recommend that you do not take your family to see this film or watch it at home! I agree with PETA: Films like this should not be made and definitely not exposed to our younger people! Hunting is wrong in any form! The mere thought of cubs being close to hunters, especially the murderer of one's father, is absolutely absurd. They are animals, not idiots!

I saw the trailer on TV, and thought it was a lighthearted, family movie. Within the first half hour, I had to get up and walk around for a while (we were at a drive-in) because I was upset. I wasn't prepared for what I saw --- the violence and cruelty toward the animals. I went with my 9 year old daughter, and we encourage her to watch ""Animal Planet"" and ""Discovery Channel"", etc. This is a movie I would expect on the above-mentioned cable programs. I totally understand that this movie was to make a point about the endangerment of the tigers, however, the trailers made it seem more ""Disney like"". As far as my stand goes with animals, I am a volunteer for P.A.N.T (Partnership for Animals Needing Transition), a local animal welfare group, I own my own Pet Sitting Company, and am the guardian of 7 cats, and I truly love animals! I think it is very important to educate people on topics that this movie covered; however, I don't think it should have been marketed to be a family movie.

On the other hand, why not? The positives are gorgeous scenery and incredibly cute tiger cubs/ beautiful tigers. The negatives are human stereotypes (ethnic/racial), ludicrous 'animal behaviour,' and an avoidance of hard issues.

I would describe this as an appropriate film for 3rd-6th graders, since some of the scenes of cruelty to animals are a bit strong for younger children, while the plot developments are too unbelievable for older ones.

If we don't teach them what happened in the past, and then allow them to learn from our mistakes, then we are doomed to eventually repeat the pattern.

For all these reviews downing this movie because they think it is cruel, let me break it to them gently...IT IS A MOVIE! The Tigers in the film did not really die! IF they would have stayed to the end, they would have read the note that reads,""NO TIGERS WERE HARMED IN THE FILMING OF THE MOVIE!!!! These people are nuts, they really are some crazy people out there, and they know who they are. It is sad because they could be voicing their opinion on movies that are really not good for children, and there are so many in Hollywood! But not this movie. This movie has it all...Love, Courage, Determination, Heroism, and Wonder, but certainly not cruelty, and hatred toward tigers or any animal for that matter. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! And for all of the animal phyco's that think they are animal lovers...stay home with your dog foo foo, and hamster peaches, and take a chill pill...

I took my three grandsons to this film and had no thought about walking out this film depicted devotion and love. Unfortunately non-humans demonstrated most of the devotion and love.

The message is clear -Humans need to wake up and learn what it is to be human. The tigers demonstrated the highest of human qualities. {Of course- pure love is the love of a child. -- demonstrated by a young boy}

Not take the children? Take your children, but please discuss the film's meaning. One should not take children to a movie or read them a story and not discuss it with them.

The movie demonstrated love and devotion. It demonstrated family values. In this film a tiger family teaches what it is to be human."

Permalink",False,"It's a movie about cute tigers. Cute as almost edible cute. Then shooting occurs and then it's bambi all over again. In a nutshell: It's okay to imprison wild animals as long as you treat them like you'd treat your poodle. Maybe even dress the animal in funny clothes. And of course eventually we get a lesson in moral. Nicely done. Another dull and predictable fuzzy animal movie has been created. In this genre of movies the underestimation of viewers is an art form.

Lots of mediocre actors with silly accents is something that seems to be almost mandatory. Filming of the movie looks as if in a cheap TV-movie. Editing is poor also, not to mention the so called special effects. The movie is morally suspicious at least. It's not suitable for kids for it's tiger tormenting scenes. Definitely not for adults either for its unforgivable dumbness and awkwardness. So who is it made for? Ps. Is it just me or does Guy Pearce always look like he has stuffed snuff up his lip..

There is not a single ray of light until the last 10 minutes of the movie. My children both cried throughout the whole thing and I had to take my 6 year old out in hysterics. Consider how your children are affected by sad stories before you take them. This movie makes things like Brother Bear and Old Yeller look like Mary Poppins!!

I gave it a 3 for the truly beautiful shots in the movie and it's good message about saving the tigers. It brings home in a very vivid way that men can be cruel and hurtful towards animals and that we must protect them. This movie, hammers this message home far to strongly to be watchable by children (or anyone else with a caring heart!!)

My mother and I walked out after an hour and ten minutes, after the animal body count, and scenes of torturing Kumar with fire to make him jump through a hoop just got to be too much for us.

The humans in the story disappoint you time after time, just when you think they will display a small bit of humanity, they don't!

The other cub fares slightly better by getting adopted by the adorable son of a British dignitary. The son treats the cub well but others in the household don't. Eventually that cub gets mistreated as well, but not by the little boy, and has to leave and is sent to the menagerie of another cruel despot. All through the movie the two brothers are shown being mistreated until you get to the point that you want to just turn the DVD player off and throw the disc out the window.

On the other hand, as it's already the case with animated movies, i never really get in touch with animals as heroes. They may be cute but they bore me so this is really not the kind of movies i want to watch on an evening: i tried it on an winter afternoon and i admit that after 20 minutes of tigers playing, i had already enough... So i switched to Annaud commentary and if the movie doesn't get awesome, his opinions are interesting... Honestly it's only the during the last half-hour that the story gets interesting with the 2 tigers causing mayhem and their chase... Sure this movie is a technical feat and having true living tigers is always better than animation but the story is not up to the challenge, the colonial cast is not really engaging and above all, the score fails to support the natural silence! This Warbeck is just awful and i think it would be just something else with a real inspired composer! At last, it's true that the opening scene is ,well, maybe a bit disturbing...

This is a story of two tigers who are separated in their attempt to scape from their hunters.

This movie also depicts colonization, irrational exploitation of natural resources, the domain of man over nature, haunting (for pleasure), animals traffic, historic objects traffic, everything presented as natural. But what in my opinion was the worst of all this is the portrayal of animals as threads for men, when is actually the men who invaded their territories.

The excuse for the mistreatment of animals shown at the beginning of the movie is the ""happy ending"". If you love animals just don't watch it.

this can only be a positive learning experience for kids. it was beautifully done and with so few family films with any real quality and intelligence, a real find.

Freddie Highmore was one of the best child actors of the decade and always gives a very professional performance. but the real stars are the Tiggers. they are adorable to an extreme if not a little anthropomorphous, a trait often found in the 'True-life' adventure films by Walter E.

this was not a Disney film however, and that's good. quality family films outside of Disney are needed. i love old Walt Disney films and sometimes their new stuff, but nobody should have a monopoly on family entertainment. i despise monopolies in our free enterprise system and would hate to see Disney become another brain-dead monopoly.

Permalink",True,"This is such a movie about the 2 young tiger cubs who were made separated in early age when they were in the care of their mother. I never saw the emotions and feelings of the two tigers depicted in any kind of story. Their thoughts were as real as we have , they had a family bond and relationship to care most about. It has given me the 1st ever inside look into the sentiments of the animal world. I was watching the world through their eyes. How much a mother tiger was in distress when her one cub is in cage and she cant make him released. The other thing was when the same cub was sold to the circus , he refused to eat inside the cage, then an elderly tiger decides to entertain and befriend the cub and it really worked, and how much the cub was schoked and dismayed when the same tiger was killed by the circus administration just in order to provide the king his skin., the cub wasn't happy anyway to be promoted like this. while the the other one landed into the house of one rich trader, where his son made him his best buddy. after an incident the cub was forcibly sent to the royal zoo , despite the displeasure and grief of boy. When the two were reunited , they were made rivals to fight each other for the sake of the king , s pleasure and crowd entertainment, and here was the moment of climax.They recognized each other. Even i was so much excited by seeing it i shouted in joy and happiness, and look at the people when the 2 started to embrace each other ,they met the treatment of stone throwing but at last both made their escape from the same place to be free for ever. They too had a right to love and care for each other the human beings deny them, their most basic one even a little boy and a hunter understood it but no other man and woman did. It is time for us to ensure the survival of this great cat the lord of the jungle from being ruthlessly ,mercilessly hunted , coz we may know it or not but our own salvation and survival is also related to the greatest cats. My personal applause for kumal and sanga The tigers, lead actors of the beautiful film.

OK, I was expecting a somewhat fun adventure movie. The beginning was exactly that, for a couple of minutes, then it got sad and gloomy. If you really like animals you won't enjoy a lot of this movie, you will like the beginning and the end but all in between is just sad and kind of depressing (my guess more than 80% of the movie).

So if you look for a fun adventure movie, keep on looking. If you look for a sad and gloomy adventure movie look no more. Or if you just don't like animals you might find it a fun adventure movie as well.

Permalink",False,"Anaud does it again, a film about the beauty of animals in their natural world, about the beauty of their character and emotions as well, about them being confronted with their deadliest enemy: the human.

I liked The Bear a lot, but I think this film is of a lower quality. First of all it has a lot more people in it and the tigers are not really presented in the jungle, but in the the world of humans where they have been shanghaied. Maybe one reason why I liked this movie less is because it shows really well the corruption and smallness of people. It leaves you with a bitter taste and a feeling of shame towards fellow men. We all say we like qualities like intelligence, compassion, kindness, but the awful truth is that a large majority of the human race is made of stupid, hateful, bad people. This film makes you really feel that.

But other than that, the tigers were beautiful. I imagine working with two tigers is harder than with a bear and a bear cub, so I forgive the obvious collages of tigers and different background. The story is also nice and it ends well. In the end of the film a grim statistic is shown about the decline of the number of tigers in the world."

Each time I see it, there are new details that I didn't pay attention to previously. The story is so carefully built up, it enfolds in a powerful, irresistible way: it's impossible not to feel a deep sympathy for these innocent cats. The young tigers are so incredibly sweet, you'd want to have one in your apartment and even in your bed, like Raoul. Reminds me when - as a little boy - I used to sleep with my cat in it's early years. Difficult not to cry when destiny strikes and the brothers get separated.

This movie looks like a rather simple fairy tale, but the feelings it triggers run so deep that it compares with the giants. Brilliant craftsmanship, great acting - including the tigers themselves -, stunning scenes and moments of great joy: how could this jewel be so underrated?

Just simply an example of superb movie-making. Great tiger acting, and wonderful interaction between the tigers & the people.

I have always thought that tigers were the most regal of all the great cats and these two are the most unforgettable and so is this movie, a real 'PIECE OF WORK' plus it took the film company, the actors & the cats huge commitment of over a year to make, and that is reflected in the final product, a genuine work of love by a genuine master of his craft.

Another nod to Annaud by the animal loving Oscar Academy committee is highly probable.

I have seen other commenter's massively complaining and asking why the filmmakers had the beautiful tigers shot, and why the film was even made...I've also noticed most of these people left before the movie ended...here's a hint, watch the whole thing, wait for the ending. The movie depicts the truth that tigers are thoroughly endangered animals, and the brutality of it is necessary, in fact if and when (I recommend the movie) you watch it, I hope you get shocked, I hope what you see disturbs you, because its a hundred times worse in modern experiences.

No, the film isn't the best quality piece, and can be fuzzed or shaky at times, but I ask you to get by that, and see the spectacular world that the filmmakers are so generously bringing you into.

Also, others talk about the anthropomorphism in the film, I tell you, they took the animals general feelings and emotions...worries and hopes, and just magnified them a bit so that we can better understand, they really do feel those things, its not imaginary.

In all I highly recommend this piece, it can be disturbing, so if children are attending with you, you may need to explain some of the happenings, but don't miss out on this, and stay till the ending. I recommend it as a must see, don't think I say this because I don't feel for these creatures, cause I do immensely, for animal lovers, and non-alike, see it, and try to understand...do something for them.

Permalink",False,"Director Jean-Jacques Annaud created my favorite film ""The Bear"" in 1989. ""Two Brothers"" extends that film's beauty and stunning animal action, as well as Annaud's theme: Humans must learn to value and cherish wild animals living in the wild.

A family is nearly destroyed, and the story of ""Two Brothers"" explores the possibility of reunion. The twist is that in this tale, it's a family of tigers, and the threat that befalls them is the greed of humans who prefer their animals in captivity, subservience, or as trophies.

Is this a ""family"" movie? I think so, in the best sense: It invites you to talk about what you have seen and learned. My 6-year-old niece loved the movie and later asked questions about tigers, trophy hunting, Asia, and animal play.

What about violence? As usual, Annaud conveys drama without gratuitous gore. He suggests rather than displays violence: there is surprisingly little blood in this story about hunting, though the threat of attack is clear and pervasive.

The animal actors are the stars, their naturalness is not compromised, and Annaud brings the best out of the human actors as well as the tigers--and the wonderful little dog. We get to enjoy their natural humor, playfulness, and tenderness.

""Two Brothers"" extends the message of ""The Bear"": We must learn to appreciate wild animals by leaving them in the wild, we must exercise our power responsibly, not by destroying life, but by letting these creatures live their lives as they are meant to. The movie leaves me feeling, if not optimism, then at least hope."

Anyway, here he was closest to normal and un-annoying as I've ever seen him.

He was right, of course, but when I saw ""Two Brothers,"" I didn't see anything that appeared to be overly humanized. It all made sense to me, anyway. And it did make me think--- who's to say animals DON'T have higher order thoughts? Maybe, oh-so-cool objectivists who decry animal lovers' overly sentimentalizations are equally wrong, and equally guilty of plastering their own versions of what the animals must really be thinking onto the creatures' behaviors. That is, accepting that animals aren't human, OK, but who says they have to be stupid, and without feelings and emotions, albeit of a type perhaps not directly shared by us? Anyway--- ""Two Brothers"" was enjoyable."

Permalink",False,"A brilliant movie for the entire family. Rarely are family films made so intelligently and effectively. The story is told through the tiger's perspective and the directer was very successful in conveying the tiger's thoughts and feelings without the use of words. Through out the entire movie you knew what they were feeling and it's easy to identify with them and their situation. The story shows how one's environment can vastly change someone and is the basis for the character development throughout the movie. It teaches the importance of family, compassion for others and the power of love.

I totally enjoyed this movie and recommend it to anyone who appreciates good story telling.

Permalink",False,"In an era of computer generated special effects, a motion picture drama starring real, living, breathing tigers is not likely to make a stir. After all, CGI dinosaurs gobble up attorneys and everything is real except the dinosaur and, sad to say, the gobbling of the evil attorney.

""Two Brothers"" (""Deux Freres"") refuses to be a compromised, saccharine, and childish story that panders to fearful parents who want to protect their children from real life, thinking that happiness results from that philosophy of exclusion. Without a doubt, the movie is a ""fairy tale,"" but in the true tradition of real fairy tales, it has a moral: unless we pay attention, we will have no real, living, breathing tigers left in the world. They'll all be killed and we'll be left only with the computer generated animals that are so popular amongst uneducated kids and not the wondrous creations that the universe has gifted us.

Big cats in nature are some of the most beautiful animals put on this earth.

Their agile movements running, hunting, playing can be breathtaking. The faces of cubs, like those of any other baby animal, are cute and endearing, and their parents as loving as any other mammal.

We're accustomed, however, to seeing lions and tigers roaring, growling, spitting, scratching and -- unprovoked -- killing ""helpless"" human beings. This has led, in real life, to the wholesale killing of animals that should be treasured and respected, not feared and murdered. Uncharacteristically, this sensitive film clarifies that left alone in nature, tigers speak softly and expressively and that anger is provoked and not a state of being to titillate us.

Director Annaud and his team, especially the animal trainers, have accomplished something that, years ago, would have been promoted with lines like: ""All real! All live! See it as it happened! Three years in the making!"" The sheer patience of urging performances from animals is mind-boggling.

With a dumbed down promotion that clearly hoped to lure in nursery school children and their Moms, the American release of Deux Freres has been dumped into a pit of oblivion between Spider Man 2 and Fahrenheit 9/11.

Here is a moving, provocative, artful, caring and indelibly memorable masterpiece that deserves, at the very least, a fine -- and UNCUT -- DVD release, and at best a brand new re-release in the Fall season of 2004 that affirms what a brilliant motion picture it really is and (parents of small children forewarned)not only not to be missed, but made recommended viewing in schools at all levels."

Permalink",False,"The biggest danger to tigers and other large carnivores is not the people who want a pelt but the loss of habitat. The world's human population keeps growing and it needs room.

Some plants are designed to be eaten. For example, fruit like tomatoes wants to be eaten so that the seeds can be spread. But carrots do not want to be ripped out of the ground.

Aside from population discipline what we need are more efficient ways to grow adequate food on less land. One way to do that is through biotechnology, but then again many people are against that.

Judging from the posts in this Board many of you would like to see someone who kills a tiger go to Hell. But I am sure that many other thinking, feeling, sensing animals will be glad to see that someone in Heaven, because that is one less predator to rip their offspring to shreds or to remove Grandpa from the family circle.

Bologna, this was a perfect child movie especially if they are cat kids like my grandson is! The supposed scenes of implied violence were so obscure that I did not even realize that violence was supposed to be going on. It is a good thing those people did not go see A Clockwork Orange, where there were good reasons to walk out early?

This was the movie I should have taken him to see first, before Spiderman 2 and Garfield! I did not out of fear of some of the reviews. I feel that they were in serious error.

This is an uplifting movie! An affirmation of love and the power of coming to, your senses. The lead hunter is the sexiest guy since Indiana Jones and I hope he goes far. The Animals were beautiful. It is rated PG and it is just that PG. Only a very, very sensitive child should not go see it. Now there 4 year olds playing in the rows while we were there, but that it a matter of the rudeness of the public nowadays. Why take a 4 year old to anything more than Finding Nemo, I don't know, but if your child is an average 6 year old or more, do not worry about violence in this movie. Technically they kill the daddy tiger, who dies a hero's death, sheesh.

I can say no more about the other reviews under decency restraints, but that they were BOLOGNA!"

A bit excessive for the under-6 set, but most older ones should be able to handle it. (Almost all of the violence takes place off camera.) It IS emotionally wrenching at times, and unflinching. To its credit it doesn't Disney-fy the issues raised (except at the end), but neither does it pile on the inhumanity. I attended a screening with a six year old, who was quite capable of following the story and understanding most of the implications contained therein. Some discussion was required about the rest.

There are difficult realities portrayed - animals that are killed, or badly treated, theft, and bribery - but not graphically or gratuitously. The various characters are realistic and unapologetically presented, and this serves the integrity of the film. As a result, it is not just ""twaddle"" - prefab sentiment and moralizing - but an interesting and ultimately affirming story.

Permalink",False,"When I saw this film, I thought it carried a PG13 rating and believe it should. While some young children may be okay with it and will likely enjoy the antics of the young cubs, let them keep their innocence a while longer, the cruelty (reality)is stark. For older kids and adults this film conveys an important message along with a touching story; tigers in the wild are in real danger of disappearing from this planet and the futility of a ""just say no"" approach to poaching (either animals or antiquities). While the film is set in in the past, the crisis exists today; habitat is lost and bounties are paid to people living at subsistance level. In the third world, tigers are not wonderful or special, they are enemies, competing for natural resources, dangerous predators. In the privileged countries, we want to see tigers remain in the wild. Humans have caused the problems and only by working together, thinking globally, can we save any animals or the human societies impacted by those animals. Having spent a year as a volunteer at a Big Cat Sanctuary I was very impressed by the aspect of this film illustrated by young Raoul; tigers are not/cannot/should not be pets. A tiger in a home or even a circus is something other than a tiger.

I found the scenes of Southeast Asia breath-taking and the cinematography and special effects quite amazing. The animal handling and training is exceptional, the movements and behaviors of the tigers natural and well done. The special effects like the ""fire-eyes"" were very effective. Having seen ""The Bear"" by the same director, I enjoyed his focus on the animals, the human actors simply present to help us see the story unfold and provide depth. A poignant story, well put together. I liked it very much.

While the events that affected Kumal and Sangha were often sad, the fate of the old circus tiger was, for me, one of the saddest parts of the film. I also found it interesting that the Distict Administrator was apparently thinking in terms of eco-tourism to provide income for his country, a notion that may be the survival plan for many countries today."

Permalink",False,"Writer-director Jean-Jacques Annaud has given us a beautifully photographed story about two tiger cubs who become separated from each other when their world is violated by man.

Many have dismissed `Two Brothers' as a kiddie film. First of all, this movie is a bit too complicated for younger children. Second, anyone who dismisses this movie sight unseen will be doing themselves a great disservice.

The main story is told primarily from the point of view of the tigers. There are some human subplots, and the human actors do offer their voices, but the story is told primarily through visuals with no dialog or narration. Annaud's skill as a director is such that he does not need the dialog to tell the story. You know at all times what the tigers are thinking and why they react the way the do. Annaud actually brings you into their mind. This is a very expertly made movie that should not be missed.

Some parts of it are very gripping and get you feeling like ""Wow, this is excellent,"" but there are just as many places that drag. Overall, though, it was worth the ticket price. The tiger cubs are adorable, and the adult tigers steal the show. Too bad there were so many unexplored human characters that kept popping up randomly, as it gave the thing a feeling of generalised unconnectedness. It was like a series of 10-minute stretches of dull material punctuated by several really amazing and involving scenes, and the whole movie goes like that.



Re: ""Not for Children"" : If by ""children"" you mean the whiny kind that has been raised on Teletubbies and has never watched the Discovery Channel or seen a wildlife documentary, then Yes. This movie is not for *that* kind of children. It's really sad that Kids' entertainment is so filtered now that the occasional moral lesson that is actually founded in reality is not allowed to get through.

How could something so beautiful be killed like this. The movie taught a memorable lesson and the beauty of having a sibling.

After watching the movie, it really changed me. I am now in a ""Save The Tiger"" phase. Donating money and things like that! I recommend this movie to everyone! So beautiful!

Permalink",False,"I just came home from taking my almost 4-year old to see the movie. I thought it was wonderful, and exceptionally well-done. I applaud the director for not showing blood or animals suffering in pain, and love the message without having had it beat over my head. My son didn't understand some of it, but he loved watching the tigers play together, and understood the concept that parents love their children and do anything they can to protect them -- whether they're tigers or people. He was cheering at one point, yelling ""Sangha!"" Many parents say they worry about violence in one breath, then let their kids play video games and watch obnoxious cartoons on TV in the next. While some of the content may have been over my son's head, I certainly thought the idea of familial love, acceptance, and loyalty came through loud and clear. Truth be told, I was more disturbed by the violence in The Lion King, which showed a young cub suffering from the loss of his father, and from the guilt that he contributed to it, than I was by one frame in this flick. Definitely put it on your ""to do"" list this weekend with your family. Maybe even (gasp) instead of Spiderman...

This film educates people on what happens to animals torn from the wild and forced into a new life. This is a heart-wrenching (but ultimately compassionate) film that takes you on an emotional roller-coaster ride. The shots of southeast Asia are stunning, with the contrast of the tigers' coats and the lush green jungle being particularly striking. The always-wonderful Guy Pearce turns in an excellent performance as Aidan McRory, the hunter who finds himself torn between his care for the animals and his concern for the villagers. This movie is for animal lovers who can handle seeing animals shot at and stricken. It's not for small children; it's no Disney film.

Putting the preachiness aside.. (especially at the end,..)

There were just too many pluses to this film to let a ""Save the Tigers"" Message"" agenda get in the way.

I just can't understand the negative reviews this film has received from parents! Besides the story of the Tigers, I thought the point of WHY the tigers needed to be shot and killed was very well laid out and understandable. The ending was not logical (leaving your rifle down in the middle of the jungle because you said you would never hunt again?? Puh-Leeze)Still...

It was up to the parents to make it clear to young children who might not be able to understand about Killing Tigers or Safety issues concerning Tigers. My 10 year old could understand. But a 4 or 5 y/o might not be able to grasp it. The Logic of why the Tigers were left to live was of course all heartstrings and warm fuzzies. Totally Unrealistic, but that was the magic of these 'two brothers'

The ONLY REAL VIOLENT part was when the father tiger was shot and killed. The other parts that seemed to upset others were only inferred. Meaning, for example, when Bitzy the dog was ""hurt' (and come on, we all wanted that dog to go) the viewer never saw any violence. The movie makers were very careful. Even when the boy, Raoul, went to kiss the grown Tiger, if you notice the camera work, He was never really kissing the Tiger or really that close to it. How they trained these Tigers to do some of the amazing things they did from babyhood in the jungle sitting among ruins until they are or capture the play times and facial expressions, well, it's just worth the money.

Then you have all the added bonuses of the gorgeous landscape, the magnificent ancient architecture and the incredible ceremonial uniforms the emperor's soldiers wore

Permalink",False,"The movie is filmed beautifully, the animals gorgeous, and the tale a sad one.

I think it's almost impossible these days to do an animal movie that does not have tragedy within it, especially considering how fast the wilds and animal species are vanishing. The movie is certainly not for young children, as it doesn't sugar-coat or portray the animals as cutesy creatures. The worst offenses occur off-screen, although we know what's going on. The movie may be set in the 1920's, but the problems wild tigers face are just as real today. Captive tigers, like the ones used to make this film, will soon be all that remains of the species.

The movie does give hope, as Guy Pearce's character comes to realize that tigers should not be shot & killed and plans to develop their territory are thwarted. Bring your tissue, though, for the ride is an emotional one. It will also cause you to think, something most summer movies tend to avoid. Don't go to escape - go to be enriched.

This film was just absolutely adorable. It was very clean, little profanity, and no sex. I'm an animal person so I really enjoyed watching it, especially after watching specials about it on Animal Planet.

My only complaint is that they should have adapted the film for television on the Animal Planet channel, but with big name star Guy Pearce, I guess that was not possible. There were tons of kids in the audience, even on a summer Monday morning. I would recommend this film to those with kids 10 and under.

During all the tense, family moments (especially the ending), I admit to getting a little choked up. 3.5 out of 5 stars.

How shabby the locals looked trying to imitate the invading society instead of being true to their own culture and truths.

I hate what civilization East and West has done to the habitats of so many magnificent creatures. I personally would prefer a wilder world with more ""jungle"" and wild species than a homogenous blob of concrete, strip centers, and ""civilized"" society. In this film one or two humans counted as noble and ""civilized"". The tigers' society was certainly strikingly noble and deserved protection.

This is not a typical children's movie, but it is one that teaches several valuable lessons and one that is a marvel of film magic. It really makes you take a close look at the destructive force of imperialism as well as the tawdry lowlifes found in any culture.

I wanted to contribute to the Nature Conservancy or World Wildlife Fund. Maybe I just will."

Permalink",False,"I've loved tigers since I was about seven and saw one at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The placing of animals as the true stars of the movie reminded me of Mutual of Omaha's 'Wild Kingdom' on TV many years ago (remember Marlin Perkins and Jim Fowler?). You've probably never seen tigers this close up and personal before. The sequences where the adults meet and mate was terrific and tastefully done. The cubs are adorable.

The movie doesn't make humans look too good when it comes to dealing with tigers, except for a young, innocent boy who only sees their beauty, and a hunter of game and ancient artifacts, who eventually sees 'the light'. That's OK, though, since humans are responsible for the drastic reduction in the number of tigers left in the world. While the tigers are revered in this movie, it's clear they are also dangerous, and the film isn't 'preachy'.

The movie was thought-provoking despite being arguably for kids (although perhaps not very young ones). There are lots of touching scenes, and the ending, while predictable, was nonetheless a rousing finale. Folks actually applauded. Perhaps you will, too.

Rating 8/10"

Permalink",False,"I can't tell you what the last half of this movie is like, because my wife and I walked out halfway through. We just couldn't stand watching the tigers suffering any more. Basically, this movie is about showing tigers suffering over and over and over again. I understand that all of these movies (""The Bear"", ""Milo & Otis"", etc.) have to have at least one emotionally wrenching scene in which the animal is separated from its parent/family, but this movie is just one long succession of emotionally wrenching scenes. It's almost just a documentary of all the horrible things that could happen to tigers. When we saw the trailer, we thought this was going to be a beautiful movie about two tigers having various adventures as they try to find each other and their way home. That might be what the second half of this movie is about, but if you can make it to that second half you are made of stone.

Permalink",False,"I watched the trailer a few months ago and was pretty excited about this one. Now that I've seen this movie however, I have to say that my expectations were a little too high. Not that there is anything seriously wrong with this movie, it just didn't gave me a 'wow, this is great' feeling.

Liked it because: * beautiful scenery * cinematography * the animal performances are top notch

Disliked it because: * storyline (very slow and not that interesting) * human characters are portayed as stereotypes
