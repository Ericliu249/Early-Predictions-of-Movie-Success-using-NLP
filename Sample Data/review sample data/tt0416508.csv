Permalink",False,"I thought it was a great story and very well cast. I didn't enter the theatre with expectations of learning the truth about Jane Austen's world, who was in it and what made her tick. I understood the movie was loosely based on the life of Jane Austen. The writers have simply devised a beautiful and clever story from only a small shred of evidence that there was a true love in her life. From what I gather the movie was really meant to be an fictional intervention in her life devised from what was known of her. I thought Becoming Jane was funny, beautifully shot and it made me giddy with lust over McEvoy. I loved the sexual energy and meeting of the minds between the love interests. I saw quite a few parallels between this story and Jane's novels. I really believe that Jane would absolutely adore this version, if not find it amusing how it was crafted. I do agree that to create a story about a much loved female author is risky territory, as there are devoted fans of Austen's who are looking for a representation that they personally feel fits their idea of what motivated her as a writer.

Permalink",False,"Seldom does one go to a movie with high expectations and ends up having them fulfilled, but Becoming Jane is an exception in this case. I was charmed by Anne Hathaway's turn in Brokeback Mountain and The Devil Wears Prada and couldn't really understand the outcry resulting in her being cast as Jane Austen and after having watched the movie I know for sure Anne Hathaway was the right person for the role.

Hot on the heels of 2005's Pride and Prejudice this movie offers a look into the early years of a spirited Jane Austen and her encounter with a man who could have formed the basis of one of her most famous literary characters Mr Darcy.

I have to say this movie is without a doubt one of the BEST period films I have ever seen. Not only is it visually stunning but the performances from everyone are superb.

Maggie Smith a delightful as the shrewd old Aunt.

Julie Walters excellent as the mother who would give anything to knock some sense into her daughter ( Jane Austen that is ).

Anna Maxwell Martin is also very good as the sister and confidante of Jane Austen.

The director Julian Jarrold has done a wonderful job of making an amazing movie that will appeal to all generations.

And finally the two very charming leads who are the very heart of the movie : Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy. In one word both are AWESOME. James although has little screen time then Anne makes you understand the sheer cockiness and arrogance of Tom Lefroy, from his live free attitude in life to his transformation as a man who begins to care for Jane Austen.His chemistry with Anne Hathaway is sizzling and a very important factor in maintaining the movie's momentum.

And at last to the leading lady Anne Hathaway. The lady is a marvel as Jane Austen, her determination and spark is vividly captured by Anne in what can be called a very career defining performance. Not only does one feel the pain for Jane but one does marvel at what holds her together and her writing makes her pull through in life.It is Anne Hathaway's spirited portrayal of the literary icon that forms the essence of the movie.

From her determination to write and her heart break to her feisty attitude to succeed as a writer is uniquely captures by the young actress. One can't really find the exact words to describe the actress's performance as Jane Austen , which is if simply put great.

This movie has the makings to become the period drama of the year. A fine job by the actors and entire crew of the movie for giving us an insight to what could have been very important years in the young authors life.

A delight to watch in every sense 8/10"

Permalink",False,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that reviews of Jane Austen movies must begin with the phrase 'It is a truth universally acknowledged...'.

I know very little about Jane Austen's life, although I spotted an error in this movie anyway: her deaf-mute older brother George was NOT raised at home with her (as seen here); he was institutionalised, and the hand-signing which Anne Hathaway briefly uses here is partly anachronistic. I confess that I've very little interest in Miss Austen, nor in her novels. But I'm hugely interested in the Regency period in which she lived. As I watched 'Becoming Jane', I was pleasantly astounded by the incredible period detail throughout the film: the houses (inside and out), the books, the churchyards, the carriages and coaches, the clothing. Even the musical instruments, the music and the dances are authentic! Well done! Of course, all these late 18th-century people have 20th-century orthodontia, and their hair is too clean. And the cricket bats don't look (or sound) as if they were made of willow, as they should have been.

I know that some people will be watching this movie for the costumes, so let me assure you that there are plenty of Empire waists, coal-scuttle bonnets, top boots and Kate Greenaway frocks. Several of the ladies wear delightful gloves.

This movie follows most of the rules for costume-drama chick-flicks. We get the de rigueur scene in which fully-clothed young women surreptitiously watch naked young men. (But not the reverse, of course.) We get the de rigueur scene in which a young woman performs a traditionally male activity and (of course) she beats the men at their own game. At a cricket match, Jane Austen steps into the crease. The bowler gives her an easy one, and (of course) she knocks it for six.

I suspect that most of this movie is fiction, and there is indeed one of those 'based on facts' disclaimers in the end credits. I was annoyed that various characters in this film constantly tell Jane Austen that, as a woman, she cannot hope to be the equal of a man, nor can she expect a happy life without a husband. These may indeed have been the accepted realities of Austen's time, but I had difficulty believing that so many people (especially young men who hope to win her) would make a point of making these comments so explicitly and so often.

Also, everyone in this movie keeps telling Jane that she cannot possibly write about anything which she hasn't experienced. (So she can't write about sexual passion unless ... nudge, nudge.) However, even in Austen's day, this premise was demonstrably untrue. If I want to write a murder mystery, do I need to commit a murder?

The performances in this film are universally excellent. Any movie with Dame Maggie Smith in it, I'm there. Ian Richardson (in his last role) is superb, wringing the full value from some succulent dialogue. James Cromwell has matured into one of the finest character actors I've ever seen, progressing light-years beyond the infantile Norman Lear sitcom roles of his early career.

As Jane Austen, Anne Hathaway has the sense to attempt only a very slight English accent, but she is far too pretty for this role. The real Jane Austen was apparently not pretty, and this was a major reason for why she never married. It beggars belief that the Jane Austen seen here -- the one who looks like Anne Hathaway -- would have so much difficulty attracting suitors. However, I'm a realist: there's simply no way that any production company would spend this much money on a costume romance and then cast an unattractive actress in the lead role.

Evidence indicates that Jane Austen's sister Cassandra was the prettier of the two, and that this discrepancy strongly shaped their relationship. But, again, there's no way that the makers of this film would upstage their own star actress by casting someone more beautiful as her sister. Anna Maxwell Martin, cast here as Cassandra, is a splendid actress and fairly attractive but certainly no beauty in Hathaway's league.

At the end of the film, a title card alludes to Jane Austen's 'short life'. She actually lived to age 41: a longer lifespan than any of the Brontë sisters', and fairly normal for Regency England. In the last scenes of this film, we see Hathaway in some dodgy 'age' make-up which makes her look rather more sixtyish than fortyish. Near the end of her life, the real Jane Austen had an unidentified illness which darkened her skin: again, I have no expectations of a big-budget film doing anything to compromise the beauty of its leading actress.

This film's title 'Becoming Jane' is a subtle pun, since Hathaway's embodiment of Jane Austen is so very 'becoming'. Geddit?

The makers of 'Becoming Jane' have gone to considerable trouble to give their target audience precisely what that audience want, which is only marginally related to the facts. On that score, they have succeeded. And the art direction in this movie is astonishingly thorough, and good. I'll rate 'Becoming Jane' 8 out of 10 as an excellent FICTION film."

Permalink",False,"I was fortunate to come across an article explaining this film. It is a speculative fiction based upon a few facts. Speculation was aroused by the fact that a woman who never married and apparently never had a love affair came to have such a deep and intelligent understanding of relationships. I shan't expand on how potentially offensive that is. But story line is based on a few simple facts. While he was in the country Jane Austen would have almost certainly met Mr Lefroy; while on a journey to see her sister she had a rather long stop off in London during which time she began writing Pride and Prejudice and there was the mention of some letters.

It started out so well; the stifling quiet of a country life broken by our future genius at work. The structure of this opening sequence was very effective. I was thinking I'm going to love this film. But there was a niggling in the back of my mind. None of the reviews had been great, but I didn't know why (I hadn't actually read any only seen the 2 ½ or 3 stars).

I continued thinking it was wonderful through most of the film. James McAvoy was beautifully intense, Anne Hathaway was solid, Maggie Smith delightfully amusing and Anna Maxwell Martin underused. There were some beautiful scenes, some so intense. For example a scene in a ball when they are both standing back to back apparently to talking other people but having a very deep conversation.

But then, as with far too many movies we moved through the climax to an ending of this story line and that story line oh and we'd better conclude this one as well and now everything is tied up in a neat little bundle.

This is a film that would have benefited from an ambivalent ending, because, aside from the fact that we know she ends up the Western World's highest selling female author the film wasn't actually about that. The film was about the journey toward it. To have left us hanging when, perhaps, she was leaving Lefroy or back in her stiflingly quiet house would have been much more effective in terms of the story and strengthened the film. It simply is not a happy ending but they tried their damned well hardest to make it one.

I'm afraid I must give this a very generous 7 rather than what could have been a deserving 8 had the film makers (or the studio or whoever the twats are that decide on these things) the courage to make this a film, not Hollywood."

Permalink",False,"Hollywood can't seem to get enough of dead female English writers. Hot on the heels of Miss Potter, and in advance of films about the Brontes, we have this romantic confection about Jane Austen's youthful fling with Irish barrister Tom Lefroy.

There have already been howls of criticism from outraged Janeites that the film is historically inaccurate. It's true that English teachers will have a fit at some elements of the story: at best speculative and unsubstantiated, at worst downright erroneous. The filmmakers admittedly didn't have a lot of historical material to work from. The true background to the story is contained in a couple of letters written by Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra, and an admission by Tom Lefroy in old age that he had once been in 'boyish love' with the writer. On this slightly shaky platform, the filmmakers have built a story of repressed passion and defiance of social mores that is a work of fiction worthy of a novel in its own right.

This doesn't really matter. Nobody in their right mind would ever accept the version of events presented by a Hollywood biopic as historical gospel. The only viewers who will be taken in by the story seen here will be those who are too lazy, too uninterested or too credulous to do the modicum of research needed to find out the real facts, and who cares what such people think? This film may be largely untrue, but what really matters is whether it works on its own terms, qua film.

Unfortunately, it doesn't, or at least not entirely. The main reason for this is the underlying premise. It is implied that without Jane and Tom's youthful affair Jane Austen would never have written her six great novels, and in particular (perhaps because it's the most familiar to audiences) Pride and Prejudice. We see Jane angrily destroying a juvenile story criticized by Tom, and later, in the throes of love, bashing out the first draft of P & P (in a single night, which shows an impressive turn of speed). It's plain that, as Tom tells her, 'experience is vital'.

The same clunkingly literal idea  that an artist must experience emotions in order to write about them successfully - underscored Shakespeare in Love, but there it was handled with a rather lighter touch. Here we are asked to believe that Pride and Prejudice was not a distillation of all Jane Austen's youthful experiences enlivened by a vivid imagination, a sharp sense of humour and a dollop of literary genius, but the next best thing to a true story. The reasons for this approach are obvious: cinema can dramatize Johnny Cash learning the guitar, or Picasso experimenting with paint, but the spectacle of a writer sitting at a desk dreaming and scribbling palls pretty rapidly.

The irony of a film that takes such wild liberties with the facts relying upon this trite old idea would certainly have been apparent to Jane Austen, whose mastery of irony is emphasized rather unsubtly throughout. Moreover, it's intellectually dishonest; lacking the ability to create a Mr Darcy, the filmmakers borrow freely from Jane Austen's characterisation in creating Tom, and thereby cheekily suggest that the author was the one who lacked the imagination to make such a person up.

These reservations aside, does the film have anything going for it? Yes. The script has some witty moments and at least makes a decent stab at realistic 18th century dialogue. Ireland is a surprisingly effective and gorgeous substitute for Hampshire, and the autumnal palette of washed-out greens and greys is appropriately sombre. Anne Hathaway is an attractively skittish and impetuous Jane, and she has excellent chemistry with James McAvoy, whose performance as Tom, by turns mercurial and obsessive, is well up to his usual high standards. Reliable support comes from James Cromwell, Julie Walters, the late great Ian Richardson and Maggie Smith, who essentially reprises her character from Gosford Park. The problem is that the lovers' behaviour never really convinces us that this relationship was the foundation of Jane Austen's later literary success, and ultimately peters out into a series of implausible endings, the number of which gives Hot Fuzz and The Return of the King a run for their money. Becoming Jane isn't an awful film, but it doesn't make the grade as a Regency Brief Encounter."

Permalink",False,"I have to say that I enjoyed it. I think there were some problems with it, but overall a nice film. Hathaway's accent is very good apart from a couple of very minor slips that could almost go unnoticed. The film, the person I went with said, was a little too slow in places, but I did not find this so. I think that the director perhaps put a little too much emphasis on Austen's inspirations for her novels and in particular Pride and Prejudice, but I did not mind this too much as that is my favourite novel. The acting all round was very good. MaCavoy played it nicely, giving a lot of energy. I thought that the opening and closing were perhaps a little weak. I don't want to say too much in case others have not seen it yet (though of course most know the ending, they may not know the films interpretation of it). Perhaps the only few weaknesses to the film was the fact that perhaps Hathaway was too pretty to play Austen, though she did a very competent job indeed. I think that Anna Maxwell Martin may perhaps have been more suited?! The other is that I would have liked to have seen slightly more quick wittedness on the part of Jane. She was shown as competent, but not as cutting and quick as I and, I imagine, many believe she was. However, despite this I quite enjoyed the film, and wouldn't mind watching it again. It is better that Pride and Prejudice 2005 adaptation in my opinion. 8/10."

Permalink",True,"See British acting royalty act circles around Anne Hathaway, who seems capable only of blinking and widening her big cow eyes, and see an icon, Jane Austen, portrayed without an ounce of the incandescent wit, sharp insight, or humanity of any the novels she wrote and whose adaptations have graced the screen. I can understand why the writer and director embellished Austen's real-life romance with LeFroy, and other biographical details, but why create such an ungracious, self-important, proud and prejudiced heroine? The way she treats Wissley is downright vulgar and mean, and there was an opportunity here to create more than one character who might (one could have wondered) have inspired the characterization of Mr. D'Arcy. Some of the camera effects are simply irritating, the score is boring, and the whole production has a muddy, static quality. Clunky period piece, not in the same league as the latest Pride and Prejudice, or any of the movie adaptations of Austen's work. It really sucked.

This version is so loosely based on Jane Austen's life - full of undocumented speculation that it seems unfair to capitalize on Jane Austen's name. If you want to know what really happened, look up her bio, don't rely on this movie. The supporting cast is terrific, especially James McAvoy and Julie Waters (as always). In my opinion however, Anne Hathaway lacked the charisma for this role. She was not interesting enough to make me care about her character or believe she had imagination enough to write a letter, let alone the works of Jane Austen! I guess I am in the minority but I found her to be without depth, wimpy and boring. I think Jane was such an important historical and literary contributor, poor casting of her pivotal role and a script based on speculation, ruined the movie for me.

Things that seem ""off"":-

-The books in the library look 200 years old...

-Anne Hathaway just does not come across as being an intelligent young writer, i.e. Jane Austen. An actress with a more subtle appearance, and more adept at slipping into the role would have been a better choice.

-The lead actor looked like a teenage boy!

-There was no need for the movie to have so many endings. One would have been sufficient

-The movie insults Jane Austen's wit and power of observation. Why must she have had a broken heart in order to write the way she did?

All in all, just go see BBC's 5 hr Pride and Prejudice. And then you will realize that this movie is so mediocre in comparison.

Permalink",False,"A film about Jane Austen, one of the greatest writers of English literature, will garner expectations and hopes, especially with a cascade of stars newly discovered (James McAvoy, Anne Hathaway) and well-established (Julie Walters, Maggie Smith, James Cromwell). That it focuses on her life before she becomes a writer certainly had not dulled my appetite.

The 22 yr old Austen is played by the very pretty Anne Hathaway, who you'll know from Brokeback Mountain and The Devil Wears Prada. We meet her family when her older sister is happily married. The cash-strapped parents have the pressing problem of finding eligible young Jane a husband. A promising offer is the stuck-up relative of wealthy Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith), who Jane rejects.

Let's meet Tom Lefroy. He's a penniless, charming, intelligent, apprentice lawyer. He also loves boxing, drinking and the fairer sex. These latter hobbies, mind you, do not endear him to his uncle, the imperious Judge Langlois, who promptly sentences him to a summer in Hampshire as punishment. In a rustic backdrop of dancing and match-making, Jane and Tom develop a teasing, flirtatious rapport. Unlike the other men in her life, Tom presents Jane with intellectual company as well as dashing good looks and a flair for the odd chat-up. As they grow more serious about each other, they become equally aware of how doomed their relationship is - something their elders twigged on page one. But Tom has given Jane something she needs - the knowledge of the heart that will impassion her writing.

Firstly be warned. If you are expecting a nice feel-good movie, don't bother. This made me thoroughly miserable. Not just because a poignant lonely destiny is too much to bear, but because it's a wasted opportunity to bring a great life to the screen. Our ultimate theme Austen's writing, yet we see little to convince that this bland and photogenic girl has much between the ears. In Devil Wears Prada, an outstanding script enabled Hathaway to suggest hidden brainpower. In Becoming Jane, the occasionally erudite lines sound leaden and false. Her body language, meant to portray a rebel, seems a bit anachronistic. Although she looks quite resplendent, dashing across the hills in a billowing red dress to watch the lads skinny-dipping, the film is a sad disappointment in the development of Hathaway's otherwise promising career. Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman (who were apparently also considered for the role) might well have fared better: they have a depth and experience that could perhaps have compensated for such a clunky script. Maggie Smith and other strong actors are reduced to ciphers and little more than icing on a badly made cake.

On the other hand, James McAvoy (fresh from The Last King of Scotland) is a revelation. In what seems like a flash of brilliance in the generally myopic casting, he shines in every scene. A talented actor, he also brings his skills in boxing and sport to imbue Lefroy with vibrancy and charisma. It is when he works his seductive charms on Jane that he also brings out the best in his co-star. After her first adult kiss, Jane trembles, wondering if she has done it well. Hathaway does gooey-eyed emotion much better than persuading us she is a genius about to happen. The film gathers pace as we are drawn into an emotional cat and mouse. Jane's 'experience of the heart' that will inspire her, is the one of the best things about the film, second only to the large and constantly moist dollops of budget-saving Irish countryside.

But how does the film reflect on Jane Austen the author? Austen's possible flirtations with Mr Thomas Langlois Lefroy are more speculative than fact. Historian Jon Spence worked as a consultant on the film and has written a book of the same name, which is probably a must-have for Austen fans. He gives attention to the inspiration he feels Lefroy gave to Jane, and this is developed into actual events in the movie.

Austen is one of the most influential and revered novelists of the early nineteenth century and her social commentary is marked with a strong sense of irony. Devotees will no doubt enjoy scenes such as the one where she corrects Tom's uncle on the definition of the word 'irony'. But the transition from girlishness to mastery with words is so contrived that it could almost be two parallel scripts.

There are many that will love Becoming Jane in spite of its imperfections. The rest of us might wish it had been told better."

The film tells the story of a young woman, Jane, who refuses to marry purely for money and embarks on writing to support herself rather than relying on a husband.

The story is well told, with excellent performances all round (especially Anne Hathaway and the always brilliant James Cromwell). The pace is maybe a little slow at times and Jane herself can be rather annoying and contradictory but that simply shows the flaws of human nature rather than being a criticism of the film per se.

Visually the film was stunning. Brilliant scenery, excellent costumes. All used to great effect to enhance the film without ever becoming overpowering or distracting from the story.

Overall, this was an enjoyable film, if not up there with Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility in my opinion. Well worth a watch (unless you are going to be annoyed by every little inaccuracy) but probably not worth adding to the DVD collection."

Permalink",False,"To make a film about the life of Jane Austen, one of the most celebrated (if not the most celebrated) female authors of all time which manages to patronise women is quite some achievement and Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams should be justly proud. This seemingly impossible feat is brought off by pretty much ignoring her many literary masterpieces and focusing instead, with barefaced inaccuracy, on a failed early romantic liaison. I'm not going to criticise the actors as they all too often get the blame for badly drawn characters but the notion that Anne Hathaway's Jane could have written a book like Pride and Prejudice is, frankly, hilarious.

I can only assume that the makers of this film have mistaken all that swooning over Colin Firth's wet shirt scene and Greg Wise's heroics on horseback as evidence that fans of Jane Austen are nothing more than lovers of ditsy romances.

Yes, Austen's stories are, essentially love stories but take the romance out and it's still great literature. It is her timeless wit, intellect and brutal exposure of human nature that has made Austen one of the most widely read and appreciated authors in history.

There is a very great, and not at all delicious, irony that the world Jane Austen describes is one in which a woman is judged merely on her ability to make a good match and that, despite all her critical acclaim as a writer, this is what film makers centuries later should choose to reduce her own life to.

I watched this film, against my better judgement, on a flight between Quito and Miami. The immigration queues couldn't come quick enough."

Permalink",False,"Of all truths to be universally acknowledged, I am, admittedly and with all possible pride, a nerd of the Jane Austen variety. Lovingly I have scanned the pages of each novel, appreciating the irony and humor. Adamantly I have viewed every film adaptation (that I am aware of), from Lee's Sense and Sensibility to Chadha's Bride and Prejudice, and, little by little, screenwriter's have slowly hacked away at her genius sometimes successfully. I have borne scenes of Hugh Grant play sword fighting, of Keira Knightly stroking Matthew Macfadyen's calf, and of Colin Firth half nude admirably well (perhaps the latter more well than others), but occasionally a writer crosses that very fine line between revering the most beloved authoress and destroying all that which she created.

I do not pretend to be an Austen purist by any means; I understand that adaptations of her novels can't all be five hours long and follow her dialogue word for word. We, the Austen lovers of the world, must surrender that movies are not books, and cannot, therefore, be identical to them. Emma Thompson, for example, made countless changes in writing her version of Sense and Sensibility, yet the alterations which she made were necessary. To me, it would be just as much a disservice to Jane Austen to follow one of her novels word for word in the screenplay and produce a dull piece of cinema than it would be to add a sex scene to Persuasion. What is important, in my opinion, is that the finished film retain the spirit of the novel, the humor, the vivacity, all that which makes her works as timeless as they are. This noted, I must express my disappointment, perhaps even disgust, in Becoming Jane, or as I have not-so-affectionately nicknamed it, Kidnapping, Raping and Murdering Jane, which is neither accurate nor entertaining.

With Shakespeare in Love and Finding Neverland as models of success, Hollywood has pumped out disappointing flicks like Miss Potter, and now Becoming Jane, expecting viewers to lap it up, but what the first two are that the latter two are not is clever. They intermingle inspiration with biography, presenting the plot of the writer's lives almost as an ode to their work. Becoming Jane occasionally alluded to Pride and Prejudice, the most famous of Austen's six completed novels, but when it did so the allusions were weak and clearly forced. It was as though the screenwriters (Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams) were only familiar with Pride and Prejudice, ignoring her other five masterpieces. What is must frustrating about this is that it would have been so simple to allude to the other works. Have Cassandra (Jane's older sister) encourage Jane to be more sensible with regards to her romance, and voilà! Sense and Sensibility! Throw in a young character that introduces Jane to bachelors in hopes of making a match, and you've got Emma! But no, all that Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams could think to do was make Tom Lefroy, Jane's love interest, seemingly arrogant, but ultimately lovable.

Similarly, the film spends so much time expressing the tragedy of Jane Austen's situation that one forgets that Anne Hathaway is meant to be the clever, witty woman that has hypnotized so many modern readers. I do not mean to scorn the movie's somewhat unhappy ending, so unlike those in Austen novels, but the way in which it ignores her character. Finding Neverland, for example, expresses the sadness of J. M. Barry's life, yet at the same time presents the story in such a way that the viewer feels as though they are watching something as magical as Peter Pan. Though Becoming Jane is certainly inaccurate, even inaccuracies would be tolerable if they were done in the name of preserving the spirit of Jane Austen's works. Instead, we the viewer are presented with a poor composition of infrequent wit and mildly appealing romance, hardly reminiscent of any of Austen's books.

Apart from the abominable screenplay, the direction was mediocre and predictable at best. Julian Jarrold does produce a pretty shot here and there, but seems to have just discovered how to shoot an aerial view, and so puts them in practically every other scene.

In spite of this negativity, I must admit that some of the acting was unexpectedly good. Anne Hathaway as Jane has a fine British accent and acts much better than I would have predicted (this is, after all, the first movie I've ever seen her in that she doesn't start out a homely geek and end up a fashion-forward bombshell). It is James McAvoy as Tom Lefroy, however, that puts in the show stealing performance. Maggie Smith is, as usual, good, as are Julie Walters and James Cromwell, even if those blasphemists Hood and Williams chose to throw in a scene of a, well, questionable, nature between them.

Even with decent acting and direction, it is hard to produce a good movie based on a monstrous screenplay. The effect, all in all, is extremely disappointing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who truly appreciates Jane Austen or good cinema."

Permalink",False,"I saw this film on March 28th, 2007 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.

The ""Jane"" is Jane Austen and this is a fictional depiction of her young adult life before her novel writing career. I suppose half of the tale is based on fact such as she rejected a marriage proposal, and half the tale is made up to create engaging story-telling. But that's not important.

The essence of the story is the mores of proper English society around 1800. Woman had their place. And that place was to give oneself to an arranged marriage and become a dutiful wife and mother. It was even more important to be in these roles if you were a daughter of a minister of modest means who had lots of children to care for. Jane was one of those children.

But Jane has spunk and smarts and a stubbornness to live her own life as she sees fit. Anne Hathaway plays young Jane convincingly and Anne's good looks are played down as much as possible. It's Jane's inner self that makes her attractive and not her exterior appearance.

And she is so attractive that she has three suitors; the rich and dull one, the poor and roguish one, and a secret and nefarious one. This circumstance allows us to see England from the various social strata, which is fun and informative.

Jane, 200 years ahead of her time, shows beauty and grace and charm and spirit, and will not buckle to her day's lot in life. We should all have such courage "" to follow our bliss"" knowing we have but one life to live.

Permalink",True,"There are many imaginative, passionate, first-rate Austen adaptations out there. The production values on this film just don't measure up. Somehow the costumes, lighting, sets and direction never gel to create the kind of ""entering another world"" experience that the viewer craves.

Anne Hathaway is a very lovely woman, but she is no Jane Austen. Hathaway is not only not believable as Jane Austen, she is not believable as a writer. She just does not convey the cerebral, verbally-obsessed nature of a writer.

Her body language is all wrong. Watching Hathaway pose, slump, and gesture like a twenty-first century American girl reminds the viewer how well notable stars of previous, well-done Austen adaptations, like Amanda Root, Jennifer Ehle, and Emma Thompson used their bodies in conveying the corporeal realities of nineteenth century feminine life.

James McAvoy is a very charismatic new star, and I try to see every movie featuring him that I can, but he just never works here, at least partly because the movie is based roughly on Austen's real life, so his character is written to ultimately disappoint both the audience and Jane, but also because he and Hathaway have no chemistry.

The movie's greatest flub is Mr. Wisley. As discussion boards show, viewers liked Mr. Wisley, and for good reason. The movie is supposed to want us to applaud how it deals with Mr. Wisley, and we don't.

Given that the movie is based on a real person's autobiography, it paints itself into corner, and the resolution we would like to see, we can't. Jane treats Mr. Wisley poorly, and gives no sign that she appreciates his depths, because he is superficially lacking in charm and grace. Would the real Jane Austen have been so blind? It's hard to respect the Jane Austen in this film who can't see Mr. Wisley's true value, but who chases after a man who can never make her happy.

Anna Maxwell Martin, who was so good in ""North and South,"" is very fine as Cassandra, Jane's older sister. James Cromwell, as Jane's father, is as excellent as he always is. Julie Walters is both lovable and believable as Jane's mother.

Permalink",True,"The British stamp out these competent costume dramas like Toyota stamps out family sedans. As long as you don't mistake it for anything but fiction, Becoming Jane is a pleasant, undemanding afternoon's light entertainment. As the two leads Hathaway and McAvoy are charming, easy to look at and know their business, while Cromwell, Walters and Smith glide effortlessly through the principal supporting roles.

The movie's view that creative genius is no more than the recycling of experience is superficial; if that were so, there'd be a lot more brilliant novels than there are. It is nevertheless fun to spot the prefiguring of characters, plot points and even bits of dialogue from Austen's novels. Lady Catherine, Aunt Churchill and Mrs. Ferrars can all be carved out of Maggie Smith's old gorgon, and Mrs. Austen has the makings not so much of Mrs. Bennet as of Mrs. Jennings and Lady Russell in her hard earned worldly wisdom. Like the brood sow whom we are twice shown, Mrs. A has more offspring than means to provide for them, and she knows it.

The mainstream critics have all seized on the parallels with Pride and Prejudice, but I think that the relationship portrayed between Austen and Lefroy resembles a good deal more that between Marianne Dashwood and Willoughby -- a clever and articulate young man charms a headstrong, intelligent but impecunious young woman by recognizing and appealing to her intelligence, raises her expectations, dumps her because he needs money and she has none, and then professes self-loathing repentance.

At that point, experience has formed the Austen who wrote the novels, which is to say a spinster who had speculated unsuccessfully in the marriage market that she afterwords observed from an emotional distance as a spectator, with shrewd, penetrating and by no means kindly wit sugar coated with happy endings. The abandoned elopement could have been dispensed with -- its purpose is merely to soften the blow by making Austen more of an agent of her own fate than victim, and to justify Lefroy's mercenary conduct.

Permalink",False,"This movie was a huge disappointment and was by far the worst movie about Jane Austen ever made.

I saw someone defend in their review that they didn't have much historical information to base it on however that hardly excuses such a complete disregard for the time period and also for such poor writing when portraying such an amazing woman as Jane Austen. Even without a historical basis as to the romance it isn't hard to realize what a character Jane was by her writing.

Another defense I saw in a review was the lack of a sex scene. I've seen numerous period pieces that do not have sex scenes and that has nothing to do with the movie not being sexy enough. The build up in other period pieces such as Persuasion or Pride and Prejudice... the restraint... these are common for the times and still lend a great sense of sexual tension... which is partially relieved when they finally kiss or confess their love. Sex isn't needed to get this point across. This movie lacked it all - there was no sexual tension, no chemistry... it was a big yawn in all ways.

It is bleak, boring and depressing. They make out that the man she was interested in was much more than she ever was yet that isn't saying much as I found him anything but lovable. He is arrogant, a womanizer, etc... and she is bland and boring.

The other inaccuracies in this movie are astounding. E.g. Her reaching for a kiss first and then asking if it were good enough? Please! This would never happen. Or showing her playing a man's sport with her pantaloons showing as she runs about. Her treating the man courting her so badly. There are many more - far too many to list.

Save yourself the time and trouble and watch a movie worth watching such as one of Jane Austen's."

Permalink",False,"I have never thought I would EVER give anything with the name ""Jane Austen"" in it a single star, but I'm so sorry, this thing sucked.

I couldn't figure out if it was more of a copy of ""Shakespeare in Love"" or ""Pride & Prejudice"" It seams like Miramax saw how good Working Title did with the 2005 P&P and they wanted to take advantage of the Jane Austen fans. What happened Miramax? You did a wonderful ""Emma"" and ""Mansfield Park"" but you really jumped the shark.

1. It is so dirty! The reason why I love Jane Austen is that she can deal with real situations in real life without having the necessity of putting sex in it to make it sell. I felt like I was reading a typical boring, fan fiction or a cheap Wal-mart Romance with the protagonist half naked on the cover.

2. I saw no originality. All was either a copy of P&P, S&S, Emma, etc. It seamed like the director watched those movies and said ""Ok, lets make a cheap and bad copy of that!"" I don't know why people keep on insisting that people's novels are based on their life's. I mean, if 200 years from now, someone make a movie called ""Becoming J.K."" they are all going to base it on the Harry Potter books because J.K. Rowling wrote them. They are going to base her off Hermione, Harry, and Ron?! Doesn't make sense, now does it. NEITHER DOES THIS

3. Casting.

Anne Hathaway!

We can say, Jane Austen goes to a ball...in PRADA.

Jane Austen meets Tom Lefroy...in PRADA.

Jane Austen writes her novels...(Yes you guessed it)in PRADA.

I have nothing against Anne being American since I live in the US, but honestly, her accent sucked. At least Gwyneth Paltrow's was believable. They should have picked someone else. For a person living in the US not to believe her accent really is saying something, you know.

James McAvoy.

I'm such a big fan of ""Atonement"" but what was he thinking?! He had the possibility of doing Mr. Darcy in the 2005 P&P and he let it go! For what?! To do Tom Lefroy!! I hated his hair. I felt like I was watching ""Drake & Josh"" on Nick or something because his hair was Drake's but in the curly version.

5. Storyline. It was dumb and boring. I felt like I was watching some sort of dumb teenage show. With all those ""innocent"" references and everything.

So, yeah, people, piece of crap. Re-watch your old favorite Jane Austen adaptations, since they are much better worth your time than this. I'm so sorry, Jane, I love you, but I'm going to have to give you one star. I hope you wouldn't roll in your grave."

Permalink",False,"Why couldn't this movie had followed in the innocence of her writings? How awful to make a mockery of Ms. Austen's writings by suggesting that her work was inspired by defiled and adulterated ideas of intimacy that may have happened around her. Wouldn't you think that would have shown in her writings as well. There were vague glimpses that existed in her writing, but it did not play a strong role in her writing and had it been important to her it would have. She kept her writings pure and innocence and in good taste, which is why so many people enjoy her works. Having said that, I feel this movie was awful and misleading to someone who may not be familiar with her works and it would mislead someone to believe her to be a woman of distaste. This is obviously not the case and I feel she has been misrepresented. Why do film makers feel that including such filth and lust is necessary. Recent movies such as Sense and Sensibility, Emma and Pride and Prejudice didn't indulge in such things and they were well received. Particularly those who are true to her stories. This was of poor taste and not recommended. I am surprised to see it was only rated PG. Everything was about sex and not the kind of love and intimacy she so very well understood and expressed in her literature. It is definitely not something I would want my daughter to see or a movie I would recommend. To those who truly grasped and understood and long for the innocence of that day will not enjoy this movie."

Permalink",True,"Watched this on a rainy evening on TV. The script was really very poor - Jane seemed so insolent rather than entertaining. The costumes however were delightful. Anne Hathaway is absolutely dire - she just looks like the Devil in Prada person - expressions varying from baffled wide-eyed to sad wide-eyed - always with a lot of very red lipstick and irrelevant curl of the lip. She seems always so dreary and depressed, whereas the writings of Jane Austen are so witty and astute - but of course that's the script. For some reason, I think she walks in a very modern way............big strides rather than little steps - but probably my views of the nineteenth century are quite wrong. The Lefroy character is very good - at least he seems amusing! Maggie Smith is as usual great fun - her nephew seems perfectly acceptable as a husband - specially for a bossy-boots like this Jane! I thought the little sex-scene at the beginning between the mother and father was particularly humorous (after 32 years of marriage!!!). .

Permalink",True,"It is one of the ironies of literary history that, although Jane Austen was possibly the greatest writer of romantic novels in the English language, we should know so little about her own romantic life. A few years ago one academic earned the obloquy of Janeites everywhere by suggesting that their heroine might have had lesbian tendencies. There is very little evidence to support this hypothesis, but in fairness to the said academic it should be pointed out that there is not much more evidence to prove definitively the hypothesis that Jane was heterosexual. We know that in her early twenties she had a brief friendship with a young Irish lawyer named Tom Lefroy, but we do not know how deep that friendship went. We know that she received and refused a proposal from a young man named Harris Bigg-Wither, but we do not know her motives for rejecting him. (This would have been a financially advantageous match, so they were presumably not mercenary ones). We know that she was still unmarried when she died in her early forties. And that's about it.

""Becoming Jane"" is essentially a filmed biography of Jane Austen told in the style of a filmed Jane Austen novel. It explores the possibility that she and Lefroy might have been deeply in love and suggests that this romance might have been the basis for her novel ""Pride and Prejudice"". Jane, like her heroine Elizabeth Bennett, is an attractive, high-spirited girl of 21. Like Elizabeth, Jane has an older sister to whom she is devoted. Her parents are portrayed as very much the inspiration for Mr and Mrs Bennett in the novel, in financial difficulties and forever worrying about how to marry off their daughters. There is an elderly, imperious widow (clearly the original of Lady Catherine de Bourgh) and a creepy clergyman (the prototype of Mr Collins), obsessively in love with Jane. There is a clandestine elopement, serving as the basis for Lydia's adventure with Mr Wickham.

This is, however, an Austen novel with a difference in that it ends unhappily for the lovers. Unlike Mr Darcy, Tom Lefroy is not the rich owner of a stately home but an impoverished, struggling barrister. The romance between Jane and Tom has the support of neither her parents who would prefer her to marry a wealthier suitor, Mr Wisley, nor his autocratic uncle, the ultra-reactionary Judge Langlois, on whom his prospects depend. (Wisley is an invented character, but he is obviously based upon Bigg-Wither, who in reality did not come into Jane's life until several years after the events shown in this film).

The film critic of the ""Sunday Times"" criticised this film for being insufficiently erotic, suggesting (referring not only to this film but also ""Miss Potter"" and ""Mrs Brown"") that the British like to imagine their national heroines in love but not in bed. There is, however, a perfectly good reason why this film did not show any love scenes between Jane and Tom, quite apart from the need to keep the family audience. Young women of good family in the late eighteenth century, even when deeply in love, did not jump into bed with their boyfriends as readily as they do in the twenty-first. Contraception was much less reliable than it is today, and any woman who lost her reputation for chastity would have been regarded as bringing shame not only on herself but also on her whole family.

Another criticism I have seen (both on this board and elsewhere) is that Anne Hathaway is too attractive to play Jane. In fact, we do not really know what Austen looked like during this period, although her contemporaries paid tribute to her ""pleasing"" appearance. There is something of a tradition of casting glamorous actresses as literary figures, and Hathaway playing Jane Austen is a much less obvious case of miscasting than Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf or Kate Winslet as Iris Murdoch. (Coming next: Catherine Zeta Jones as George Eliot? Angelina Jolie as Emily Dickinson?) Hathaway, in fact, played her part very well. As in ""Nicholas Nickelby"" her British accent was near-perfect, and James McAvoy (something of a rising star of the British cinema after ""The Last King of Scotland"") made an appealing hero as Lefroy, a man who hides his better nature under the guise of a roguish libertine. There were also some good cameo performances in the minor roles, especially from the late Ian Richardson (in his last role) as the formidable Langlois. Another notable feature was the look of the film. Like most period dramas it was attractively photographed, with County Wicklow in Ireland substituting for Austen's native Hampshire.

There has in recent years been a glut of films about British female authors, but apart from ""Miss Potter"", a touching romance about somebody who played a very minor role in the history of English letters, the only one I really enjoyed was ""Sylvia"", which I felt gave us a real insight into Sylvia Plath's life. ""Iris"" was well acted, but there seemed little connection between either Judi Dench's senile old lady or Kate Winslet's student sexpot and the real-life novelist Iris Murdoch. Similarly, ""The Hours"" was not very enlightening about either Virginia Woolf's life or her work. ""Becoming Jane"" falls into the same category. It relies too heavily on the biographical fallacy, the idea that works of fiction must be, in effect, disguised memoirs of the author's own personal experiences, an idea which downplays the role of creativity and imagination in literature. As a romantic drama with a period setting it is perfectly acceptable, but it does not do much to enhance our understanding of Jane Austen. 6/10

Permalink",False,"In ""Becoming Jane"" a young Jane Austen (Anne Hathaway) is told that she needs to find a husband. It's a common adage for women in the 18th century and for women now. But Jane is too independent and no man is ""perfect"" enough for her. Enter a very imperfect man like Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy) and we get a love story for the ages. She's offended by his sleazy reputation and audaciousness and he reads Henry Fielding—how deplorable! But she's also intrigued by his outspoken ways and that he accepts her just as she is. The film takes the stereotypical romance from today's romantic comedies and dramas and places it in Jane Austen's 1790s England.

There is evidence to suggest that such a love affair occurred, but it's not necessarily historically accurate. However, the characterizations are more important than the facts. Hathaway may have given Austen an American accent but she got the essence of who Jane Austen really is. And James McAvoy as the nefarious Tom Lefroy is exactly the kind of man she would need to meet to inspire her novels.

The film is able to add an extra level of interest to both the stereotypical romance and the historical biopic by reading between the lines and creating her perfect leading man. I loved their romance and like to believe that it really did occur. I'm a fan of Jane Austen and think of her as a woman ahead of her time and ""Becoming Jane"" shows that. It's not a gushing, effusive story about how great she is, it's just a great story."

A pale, feeble imitation of Shakespeare in Love, only no Tom Stoppard script. If you want to make a movie of a Jane Austen book, there are six of them and they are great. If you want to make the next in line of the 1,000,000 lame brained romantic comedies, well, fire up the assembly line. But why make a movie that looks like a Jane Austen book/movie, is marketed like a movie from a Jane Ausent book, but has the hack dialog of an assembly line romantic comedy? This was brought home to me just before I left, in a dance scene that looks like a dance scene from Pride and Prejudice, but is scripted like a TV sitcom. As the actors were mouthing their witless clunky conversation, I kept playing in my head the original words and wondering why on earth anyone would bother with this nonsense. Another example, and a particularly execrable one, of people making a movie that seems to deliberately remove everything that made the book worthwhile. This isn't' about failing to adhere to the details of Austen's life. Who cares about that? It's about using Ausen like a brand name, like charging people to see a color-by-number Mona Lisa. You wonder, don't they know, or don't they care? Yuck, yuck, yuck."

Continuity problems Doesn't anyone watch their dailies? Where is the set director, the props department, the wardrobe master? Every scene has multiple continuity errors.

There are 5 cuts showing her on her pillows, but the pillows in each scene are moved around and some are even missing. UGH! This is just sloppy and lazy movie-making.

Permalink",True,"Let me say this first: Yes. This movie is, in fact, NOT BASED OFF REAL LIFE. This appears to be the highest complaint for this clearly delightful and moving film about the fictitious life of Jane Austen. I walked into the theatre to see this movie knowing fully well that it was based off minor speculation, and anybody who has any knowledge of Jane Austen knows that this movie is not real.

It is a movie beautifully portrayed in the likes of Shakespeare in Love, where Shakespeare was transformed into a poetic hottie, rather than the ugly man with wooden teeth that he was most likely to have been. Shakespeare in Love garnered an Academy Award for best Picture, whereas Becoming Jane has been criticized for its lack of reality. Personally, I don't see what the fuss is about.

Becoming Jane is a beautifully directed film when fantastic scenery and sets. Anne Hathaway and James MacAvoy both have haunting and entertaining performances, making their slow journey to love extremely wonderful to watch. Maggie Smith is wonderful as well in her small role as a woman who, I can only assume, was the inspiration behind Pride and Prejudice's Lady Catherine.

While the story does falter near the end, giving the audience too many climactic moments before the film actually finishes, I found it to be achingly romantic. MacAvoy and Hathaway had great chemistry and were thoroughly convincing as a couple deeply in love, an emotion that caused them as much distress as it caused happiness.

The movie exudes subtle sexuality, displayed in a scene in which MacAvoy reads to Hathaway a passage from a nature book about mating birds and the female's ""screams of ecstasy""; another scene shows the lovers walking up stairs to ask for permission to marry, MacAvoy gently grazes Hathaway's hand with his own and fondles the skirts of her dress. It was these subtle signs of love and lust that made this movie a treat to watch, being as overt sexuality would not have mirrored the time period. A scene at the end of the film in which, many years later, the couple meet each other by chance and we see MacAvoy's daughter, a charming lover of Jane Austen novels, conveniently named Jane. His daughter, named Jane, is based on fact. The movie is a chilling look on the few options that women had at the time, and shows that, although true love can be found, it can't always be kept.

I recommend this film to anyone who is a lover of Austen, a lover of romantic films, or just anyone who is interesting in seeing a thoroughly entertaining and beautifully sad film about a love unexplored.

Let's give Hollywood a big Bronx cheer for trying to bring a classic Regency auteur to film, but failing miserably. Anne Hathaway, who actually can act, is terribly miscast, with a poor imitation of the appropriate Brit accent and directed to be as exciting, sensual, and intellectual as a soggy sponge. The sexual tension between her and Mssr. Lefroy is far less exciting than, say, the tension between Kermit & Ms. Piggy. The historical and geographical gaffes (Hampshire has a SMALL coastline by the major port cities, but not the idyllic shore as is depicted with Jane & Cassandra; ""madame la guillotine"" re Henry's comtesse suitor is a few decades off) make the film somewhat laughable, which is its only saving grace. I managed to stay awake only by counting the historical and factual inaccuracies, attending amusedly to the laughable dialogue, and experiencing sheer awe at the feeble attempts at drama resulting in snickers rather than apt attention in the theater where I suffered through it. Go see the real movie.

Permalink",False,"I must admit that when i started watching this film it was awfully similar to Pride and Prejudice, the same country scene, even the idea of Jane playing the piano, everything in the first part of the film reminded me of pride and prejudice and thats what really spoiled it for me.

The second part (starting from the ball scene)again, was similar to the film mentioned above with some added bits to it.

I think the acting was as good as it could have been, in some parts it felt like it was overplayed, as if the actors were trying too hard especially the main actress. I don't think that Jane (the main character) was ready for such a big role, she is still a young actress that hasn't got that much experience especially for this kind of films. Over all i must admit it was disappointing, and lacked a lot of the emotion which should have been there.

I've seen a lot of reviews to this film but couldn't quite agree with any one of them. I would suggest watching this film only in order to compare and see how similar it is to Pride and Prejudice."

Permalink",False,"I confess to knowing very little about Jane Austen, except that she is the creator of Mr. Darcy, whom Colin Firth portrayed beautifully in a BBC adaptation of 'Pride & Prejudice', doing a particularly good job in a certain pond-diving scene.... That being said, I knew enough tidbits about Jane Austen to know that Julian Jarrold's film 'Becoming Jane', written by Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams  took quite a few liberties with the truth. I realize 'Becoming Jane' is not a rigid biopic, and the writers I am sure assumed that their audience would not take their tale for fact  however, my problem with their artistic license is the fact that it wasn't very original.

Hood and Williams have taken small bits of fact and made them significant in the life of Jane Austen. The entire film centers around her 'relationship' with Tom Lefroy  a law student entirely dependent on his uncle who sends him to stay with family in the countryside in an effort to tame his wild ways. A simple internet search reveals that the relationship Hood and Williams would have us believe was a pivotal turning point in the life of Jane Austen, providing her with a muse for one very famous Mr. Darcy, was no more than a casual flirtation, if that. It can never be known for sure how important Tom Lefroy was to young Jane Austen, especially since after her death her sister Cassandra burnt many of her letters written at the time of their meeting. However, Lefroy is mentioned in at least two surviving letters between Jane and her sister; one dated January 9th 1796 and the next January 16th, in which she writes (sarcastically?) ""Friday. -- At length the day is come on which I am to flirt my last with Tom Lefroy, and when you receive this it will be over. My tears flow as I write at the melancholy idea"". In 'Becoming Jane' however, Lefroy and Jane become prematurely engaged, are torn apart by family, status and money; try to elope but ultimately part ways. This is not giving anything away; since history tells us Jane Austen never married (I was surprised though when in the cinema people were gasping during Tom and Jane's 'getaway', were they really in suspense as to how the story would end?). It is implied that Tom Lefroy was a great impact on Austen's writing; not only offering her book recommendations but also in their not so happily ever after fairy-tale romance. This, coupled with her sister Cassandra's untimely loss of a fiancée to yellow fever, all account for the all too convenient and happy endings Austen's protagonists meet in her novels; proclaiming, ""My characters... shall have all that they desire"".

Honestly, I have no problem with movies taking liberties with the facts for art's sake. My problem is that Hood and Williams molded these facts to fit the framework of 'Pride and Prejudice'; which is such an easy route to take. It certainly feels as though 'Becoming Jane' is riding on the coat-tails of Joe Wright's successful 'Pride and Prejudice' adaptation of 2005, but failing miserably to live up to that film's brilliance. Everything from 'Becoming Jane's' movies posters to the soundtrack are a rip-off of Wright's 'Pride and Prejudice'. Jane Austen is such an interesting historic character; she was a feminist for her times, and her writing has indeed transcended time. Why must we have a film about her in which a man determines the course of her life? I wonder what the real Jane Austen would think of a film all about how writing was a 'fall-back' when happily ever after fell through? Why did there have to be a love interest at all? I for one would have been happy with a film that was all about social status in the 17th century and women's roles in society  with no love stories whatsoever. Wouldn't it have been ironic bliss to have a film about the real Jane Austen, who wrote one of the world's best love stories, to contain no romantic notions at all?

I don't know what to say about the actual look of the film since, like so many other things, it's all been done before really. It has the same look and feel of Wright's 'Pride and Prejudice', and the 1996 'Emma' and the 1995 'Sense and Sensibility'. It's all been done (and better) before.

Everyone is raving about Anne Hathaway in this so-so film. Yes, she has a competent accent, but I personally don't see what all the fuss is about (and this isn't because I was one of those nit-pickers who were appalled at the thought of a yank playing an English icon). To be fair, the script doesn't give her a lot to work with; she's really just trying to live up to Keira Knightley's Oscar nominated performance as Elizabeth Bennett, and in comparison Anne Hathaway falls dismally short. I was really disappointed that Jame McAvoy (a rising star who I have adored since seeing him in the deliciously funny 'Shameless' back in 2004) wasn't a stand-out. But once again, the script offers little for him to really sink his teeth into. Tom Lefroy is written as such a flat, 2-D, typical love interest, not even the brilliant McAvoy can do much with the character (and on a side-note, I hated how badly Tom Lefroy aged  those gray mutton chops, eek!).

Over all I can describe the film in one word; 'bland'. See it to drool over the lovely James McAvoy, but otherwise go and watch Joe Wright's 2005 'Pride and Prejudice'. I am just holding on hope that one day a really great biopic (minus any love interest) of Jane Austen will be made to wash out the bad taste that 'Becoming Jane' leaves behind."

Permalink",False,"An entertaining flight of fancy. I read too many news articles portraying this as the true story of the romance between Jane Austen and Tom Lefroy. As I left the cinema I overheard many viewers commenting that they did not previously know that this or that happened. That's because, as far as anyone knows, they did not. I have no objection to conjecture and imagination, but it should be made obvious that it is just that. Will students be putting elements of this into exam answers? (Not unlike the student who, when answering a question on Romeo and Juliet is quoted as saying 'I especially liked the way Romeo and Juliet met looking through the fish tank'.) However, good English accent from Ms. Hathaway (even though it's more likely to have been a Hampshire accent); shame Tom Lefroy did not sound Irish; beautiful scenery that was a good substitute for Hampshire; brother Henry was very believable and how good it was to see brother George acknowledged. Despite concerns about accuracy it was a good night out and if Miss Austen herself was watching, she probably wished it had been more like that in reality!

Permalink",False,"I won't look at ""Becoming Jane"" as at a life story, for it provides too little to be individualized. Therefore, I am forced to look at it as a film about love, duty and societal standards.

I believe that if you didn't know Jane Austen was the main character of the film, it could well have been any other romantic character of the end of the 18th century. Romantic in the sense of both sensibility as well as fundamental structure. So does this film stand out in any way? Well, it looks rather neat and tidy conveying a quite vivid depiction of the times...and I reckon the film starts off pretty well, introducing some intriguing characters, of sorts so different that they could make a story worthwhile. But this feeling fades as the movie advances, most disturbingly with the sudden transformation of Lefroy - from boy with money who wants only to enjoy the pleasures of life, to deeply enamored young fellow of some considerable passion. As it strides forward, the story ceases to intrigue and turns into a sappy tale of romance which just cannot be saved by the decent cast.

Myself, as a stranger to Jane Austen's world - both the fictional one as well as her very own life - left the cinema with an acute feeling of simplicity, as the film struggles similarly to the characters through all sorts of social boundaries. It probably works best as a work on ""choice"", on sacrifices of life, and as its main goal is to enlighten us upon the character of Miss Austen, I deem this bearable. The problem is, Jane Austen - the film persona - comes over as the conventional, emancipated woman of the century. This is of course rightly so, but rather flaccidly developed throughout.

While ""Becoming Jane"" can be an enjoyable experience, I doubt it is something for acute movie lovers, as the only thing it exceeds in is lack of originality and bad character development. Even the plot tends to be too contrived for its own sake, and the puddles of mud in which all the carriages get stuck during the film are sort of metaphoric for the melodramatic marshes we encounter."

Permalink",True,"This is my favorite movie of all time! I could tell just from the previews that I was going to love this film! I absolutely cannot wait for it to be released on DVD. I just loved everything about this movie- every scene. I love Jane Austen's time period where the men were true gentlemen and the women were elegant and refined. I love the dancing, and the dresses, the conversations and the long walks, and especially the forbidden glances and the small, silent displays of affection. In every one of her novels Jane Austen makes the main character a strong, independent woman with a mind of her own, so it is no surprise that she herself was such a woman. She was an aspiring writer and a free thinker who never gave up on her dreams, even when her life did not turn out as it should. Anne Hathaway did an amazing job 'becoming Jane.' But I must say that James McAvoy is the star of the show. Yes, I suppose I am a bit biased seeing as how I am one of his biggest fans but still! He did a phenomenal job portraying Mr. Tom Lefroy. In the beginning he comes across as a carefree boy who is only out for a good time, but then later he becomes very much of a man. They both had such great chemistry together. I think my favorite part in the movie was when they went to the ball and all of the sudden James McAvoy appears right in front of her and they finish the dance together. That was great and I loved his smile in that scene too. And that was one of the best kisses of all time- the best I have ever seen. The ending shocked me completely! I kept telling myself as it got closer and closer to the end that that wasn't it and that it would all work out. There were so many different things I felt they could have done to make it work. He was willing to give up everything to be with her and I felt she should have done the same because that's what true love really is. But it didn't end the way I wanted it to and the way I'm sure everyone else hoped it would. However, the last scene did give you a small amount of closure and made you feel somewhat better about how the two were parted. It's sad to think though that Jane Austen didn't get the happy ending that all of her heroines did. It was bitter sweet. Overall, this was one of the greatest movies of its time- a truly great love story.

Permalink",False,"Being a Jane Austen fan I may be a bit biased. Overall I really enjoyed the film, although I am not sure if it is historically correct in regard to Miss Austen's romantic life. Anne Hathaway gave an excellent portrayal of Austen, who in the film seemed more like a Miss Elizabeth Bennett; the main character of her book Pride and Prejudice, a book she writes throughout the movie. James McAvoy fits the role of Tom Lefoy brilliantly, giving a roguish charm and depth to the character. James Cromwell and Julie Walters portray Austen's parents with a Bennett air, being in a money problem and wishing their daughter to marry a wealthy man. Maggie Smith gives great depth to Lady Gresham, a wealthy women living near them who is looking for a wife for her nephew, who is to inherit her estate. The script is well written and has a good, if not average, romantic story line with moments of humor.

From a filmmakers point of view the most appealing aspect of the film is its artistic direction and cinematography. there is a wide range of angles and transitions used throughout the film, as well as inventive setting of cameras and lighting. The area of Ireland that the film was shot in is magnificent and beautiful and emerges the viewer into the world of Jane Austen.

At times the film seemed to be a parallel of 2005's Pride and Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen. I would recommend this film to Jane Austen fans and romantics alike, possibly even to those who do not care for 18th century English life. The film transport the audience to another time when the main form of transportation was carriage and horses, and women were expected of no more than to marry and care for the household and children. Add a dash of romance, a love triangle and a cast of excellent ensemble characters and Becoming Jane is born. It is a inspiring film that gives insight to the woman who was Jane Austen."

Permalink",False,"I usually love this type of movie but I found it all very boring. Ann Hathaway was not an ideal choice for the role of Jane, the Great Maggie Smith was wasted as was Julie Walters. Difficult to imagine Hathaway as a famous writer, her reading of Jane's books would put many to sleep. Very disappointing in my humble opinion Perhaps it was the writers faults, how can anyone compete with Jane's works such as Pride and Prejudice. However the scenery and atmosphere were well captured and at least it is a welcome change from so many bad movies coming out of America I watched it with my family, my daughter enjoyed it, perhaps I might get more out of it in a second viewing

I am a complete sucker for a good romance and I haven't seen one this good since Sense and Sensibility. (please note, I haven't seen Kiera Knightly's P&P because NO ONE can replace Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy!!)

Was it a phenomenal film? No, not really. Was it the epitome of biographies? Obviously not

But what it was, to me, was a good old-fashioned romance story. And even though the ending isn't all rainbows and lollipops, it is a very, very satisfying ending. (no, I didn't know the facts of Jane's life, so I was surprised at the turn of events).

In the end, apart from the excellent cameo performances from Ian Richardson, Maggie Smith, and to a lesser extent Julie Walters and James Cromwell, this was little more than a vehicle for Miss Hathaway and the beautiful scenery and interior sequences, and the continued clumsy direct insertion of fragments of Pride and Prejudice became increasingly tiresome....and finally, surely James McAvoy, despite a superb performance otherwise, could have attempted at least the hint of an Irish accent, rather than Scottish! A very disappointing film.

Permalink",False,"Becoming Jane is the latest in the ""Author in Love"" genre, nodding at historical fact but not really engaging it.

Anne Hathaway plays the Regency Romance version of Jane Austen - all witty one-liners and self-important attitude. She also writes, which the film feels obligated to remind us from time to time.

It's difficult to watch a romance about a person we know never to have married. Jane becomes involved with Tom Lefroy, a man determined to show her ""the ways of the world"". Tom has wit, is pleasant looking, and apparently this is enough of a reason for Jane to be attracted to him. Trouble is, Hathaway's portrayal of Jane leads us to believe in her intelligence.

Jane's other prospect is the nephew of the local Weathy Widow. Mr. Wisley is the 19th century equivalent of an engineer personality type, but when Jane stops and jots something down, he's the only one who understands what she's doing.

There comes to a point after things go badly with ""bad boy"" and Jane has an opportunity with ""good boy"" (this is not a spoiler, since we all know Austen never married, so empirically the Tom romance had to fall through). As Austen fans, we go ""wait, I know this one!"" But no - because the film has chosen its historical subject matter, life cannot imitate art.

Writing, to this Jane, seems to be more of a hobby than obsession. But for a woman to be published and accepted as a writer during her lifetime (especially one as short as Austen's), more than a little determination would have to be involved.

In the end, the movie's Jane isn't as clever as Elizabeth, wise as Anne, or prudent as Eleanor, and I went home wanting to reread the real stuff."

Permalink",False,"Jane Austen (Anne Hathaway) is the youngest daughter of a far-from-wealthy minister in rural England. Despite being lovely and very intelligent, with a gift for writing, Jane's prospects in marriage are dim, as she has no dowry. When the heir-to-be nephew of a neighboring lady (Maggie Smith) makes Jane the object of his affections, her parents (James Cromwell and Julie Walters) try to persuade her to accept his proposal. But, Jane wants to marry for love and she has little regard for the man in question. So, she turns him down. There is a man, however, that captures her fancy. New to the area, Thomas Lefroy is an Irish lawyer who will inherit a fortune from an English uncle. Jane, although initially disgusted with his swagger, finds Tom to be a man she could adore and the feeling becomes mutual. However, since Tom's future depends on keeping his uncle happy, will penniless Jane be acceptable as a wife? This is a lovely film, in composition and in character. As the film states in the closing credits, Austen wrote six of the ""finest novels in the English language"" and everyone around the globe, loving her books dearly, wants to know what she was truly like. Therefore, the movie is definitely a window into her world, a world where her circumstances did not limit her imagination, ever. Hathaway does a fine job in bringing the legend to life, as she is beautiful, witty and sensitive. All of the other players, including the man who plays Thomas, are also first rate. As for the costumes, settings, and cinematography, they are very, very nice, recreating the atmosphere of the times wonderfully. If you love Austen's books, you must not delay a showing of this film for long. It will be your most delicious cup of tea ever. But, if you just want to watch a film brimming with loveliness, good values, sharp characterizations, and more, you will find Becoming Jane a nice selection."

Permalink",False,"'Becoming Jane' treats Jane Austen with the same fundamentally naïve assumption as Laurant Tirard's current 'Moliere': that authors invent nothing but simply copy out people they've encountered in life. Again as in 'Moliere' we're told in Jarrold's 'Jane' that an writer's best work is full of real-life charactersso half the fun of the movie is identifying characters who correspond more or less to Mr. Darcy, Lady Catherine de Bourg, and Mrs. Bennet from ''Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Elton from 'Emma', and so on. Again as in 'Moliere', a young writer is involved in a romancebut this time that crowd-pleasing device seems a bit more apropos, perhaps indeed a whole lot more, since obviously courtship, and the issues of love vs. money are so central to Jane Austen's novels that to see Jane, who never married, involved in a troubled love affair early on herself is an interesting idea. Besides which, Jane Austen's novels have so often been put on film even quite recently that this fits naturally into the context.

A French reviewer called 'Moliere' ""Our ''Shakespeare in Love.'"" Well, maybe, if you think it's as good a movie. The same comparison has been made with 'Becoming Jane,' which seems not to have met with a stunning critical reception. Perhaps viewers and critics are exhausted after dozens of screen and television adaptations of Miss Austen's novels. Yet becoming Jane is fascinating in various ways, and is well served by a fine cast beginning with Anne Hathaway, whom we last saw as Meryl Streep's dogsbody in 'The Devil Wears Prada.' Who would have known she had the poise and restraint (and command of an English accent) to make a convincing Jane Austen? But she does. And as her attractive, dangerous suitor-in-spite-of-himself Mr. Lafroy, James McAvoy is very winning. James Cromwell is good as Jane's father, and Maggie Smith is formidable as an elderly lady of wealth and position who's extremely disapproving of Jane's unwillingness to marry her enamored but unprepossessing nephew and heir. Into Jane's provincial world comes Lafroy, a young Irish law entirely dependent on a wealthy barrister relative.

A blogger named Elisha has this to say about the film: ""Went and saw Becoming Jane last night.. really liked it, even if in parts I was like...""they so would not have behaved like that"" (here she inserts a toothy grinning smiley). The guy (think it was James McAvoy) that played Mr Lafroy was so Hot!!!!"" And EdwardianGirl89 wrote, ""I liked the way they separated though! And I was soo aprehensive about AH but from the first 30 seconds I was like THIS is Jane. She was great!"" Well, yeah. . .

It is highly unlikely that the real Jane Austen would have gotten into a romantic adventure like the Jane of this movie. But there really was a Mr. Lafroy. And when the two of them are at the second ball, its soo right that they're involved in articulate, witty conversation the whole time--till they kiss! The reason why this seems ultimately more worth caring about than Tirard's 'Moliere' is that there are real emotions in it, and if Austen didn't get into a mess like this, some of her characters most certainly did. And this time nobody has to tell Jane Austen what kind of novels to write. She knows. The film cleverly saves Mr. Lafroy from being a cad or an idiot even though things, well..better not to reveal the way it turns out.

If this business about how writers come into being and find their material is rather simplistic and absurd in both movies, 'Becoming Jane' is smarter and more emotionally true. It does go so far as to show Miss Austen visiting Mrs. Radcliffe, the wildly successful Gothic novelist, and learning that her life had nothing to do with what happened in her books. Apparently that is a truth NOT universally acknowledgedand hence fun to play around with.

It looks as though critically 'Moliere' is being overrated in this country, while 'Becoming Jane,' which has been generally dismissed, has not gotten a fair shake."

Permalink",True,"I do agree that the choice of Anne Hathaway was a gamble. She was a charming, sweet character yet the fact that she can not hold a British accent becomes painfully apparent.

James McAvoy blows everyone away with his amazing performance of Tom Lefroy. He was charming, arrogant and as clever as he could be. Not to mention extremely handsome, but this is aside from the point.

The movie haunts you as it plays the romantic story that is often too true for the movies. I can't shake some of the scenes from my mind as they echo the play of my own life. My mind continues to replay some scenes from this movie with scenes from my own life playing in the back.

The chemistry between the two is amazing and it makes you forget the rest of the film.

It will make you laugh, smile, gasp and let bitter tears rise up your eyes and a pinch in the back of your throat. In all my years of somewhat wasted movie watching, I have never seen a movie that has played with the heart as much as this. It struck painfully familiar chords and relived long forgotten, glorious moments of the past.

Be warned, this movie is unlike any romantic/sad film that I have seen. Nicholas Sparks has got NOTHING on this film (and he never will). Sometimes, I even wish that I never saw this film as I feel that those moments hit too close to home.

Yet I am still glad that I saw this beautiful movie that tells a true, unfluffed version of life, love and what is lost.

After watching it, I felt disappointed that she did not preform up to her usual standard.

Also, while there was some amazing camera work in this film, I found many parts were jumpy. You could actually tell the camera was moving up and down. But, for the most part, the camera got some great shots.

Lastly, I found it difficult to hear what people were saying at times. If you can't understand it, why bother?

If you're looking a great chick flick, I would try 'Pride and Prejudice' (Keira Kightley, Matthew Macfadyen) or 'Sense and Sensibility' (Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson). These movies are both based on Jane Austen books. And both are wonderful."

Permalink",False,"Hello Moviegoers, Saw Becoming Jane this week, my god what a yawn - TIME STOOD STILL - I should mention that my wife was quite engrossed. I was so bored my toes were curling so I left for a half an hour and talked with the popcorn girl - didn't miss a thing.

Becoming Jane takes place in 1796 and is a somewhat fictionalized biography of Jane Austen. Beautifully photographed in Ireland, but slow, this film makes Sense and Sensibility look like an action picture. It has all these moody shots, I guess I expected a movie about the life of a writer would have a lot of clever dialogue, no such luck.

Will she marry the rich guy and have a comfortable life or will she marry the man she loves and live in penury. This is pretty much the center of the movie and they drag this question out for two longggg hours.

I've loved a lotta so-called chick flicks, The Painted Veil, Miss Potter, The Waitress, but Becoming Jane is just too boring for words.

This is K-PYG

Permalink",False,"What a great opportunity this is. It seems Austen is more filmed in various ways than any other novelist. Why not invent a fictional story that has her in situations cloned from her (only six) novels?

Why not use Ann Hathaway, who was smart and good enough to give the master performance in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" serving as one of the two on-screen controls? She knew there that she had to play a woman who was creating the story she lived in and expected others to. I was really impressed at this, and others must have been as well. This is how an authoress might best be played when the story is her writing of her story.

Why not populate it with all sorts of surrounding texture the way Austen does? It seems all this was decided.

But then the other essential bits were left off. To do this right, you must use the same sort of cinematic vocabulary that she used in writing. We do know how to use the eye this way, something that is unrelentingly curious, deep and ironic in the simple sense she used.

It cannot be ordinary in the BBC TeeVee movie way, that sort of shortcut to watching that is economical to make and watch. And it cannot have those modern racking tricks (where one focal plane is changed to another to reveal a different perspective). Those were actually pretty good here, but wholly inappropriate for the project.

One thing was extraordinary. Toward the end, we see our woman 15 or 20 years later. The aging makeup was very effective. This was a different woman we see, one who has become something that underscores what they probably set out to make and got off track.

One blot is James Cromwell. He's a blot in everything except where he plays the evil lawyer. Are there no other men in Hampshire?

Permalink",True,"It would take someone far more knowledgeable than I am to comment on the veracity or lack of it in this take on the early, pre-published life of Jane Austen so all I can do is approach it as a period piece with an unresolved Beatrice and Benedek relationship as its centre. Again I have no knowledge of Jane Austen's physical appearance, tall, short, plump, blonde, brunette, etc so I take it on trust that Ann Hathaway does have a reasonable resemblance to the real thing and I have no quarrel with her acting ability. Someone, maybe even his own mirror, has clearly told James McAvoy that he looks like a dark-haired Tommy Steele so he pulls out all the stops in a Xerox of that singular Steele combination of cocky full-of-myself arrogance underlying a please-love-me element which is probably an asset if you're an impressionable teen-aged girl but tends to grate on the more mature viewer. On balance this one is head and shoulders above the recent Pride and Prejudice and and there's a nice nod to Now, Voyager, when the spinster Austen befriends the daughter of her love, McAvoy, just as the spinster Vail (Bette Davis) befriended the daughter of HER love, Jerry (Paul Henried); in short; the all-pals-together jobs-for-the-boys television team of writer and director provide a decent bedrock for the actors to play in front of. Clearly a crowd-pleaser.

I had no trouble believing that this independent, articulate woman would behave this way and speak this way. And I like that the guy who won her, seduced her (mentally) with a book! (Tom Jones). This is a much better movie than I expected, and Anne Hathaway (whom I've only seen in comedies ere now) did much better acting than I expected. I'm told that a lot of the script is based on speculation (because there isn't that much known fact about Jane Austen's life), but as an engrossing story, the script works superbly.

Permalink",False,"that's not exactly true. This movie is about a young Jane Austen and the one guy she loved that helped inspire her to write her novels. Jane has a father whom is a preacher and receives an offer to marry from Mr. Wisley, a man whom will inherent his Aunt's wealth. Of course, her family wants the union to take place. However, Jane has ideas of her own. She has fallen for a young lawyer, Mr. Lefroy, and wishes to marry him. Mr. Lefroy depends on his uncle for money to support himself and his siblings. The uncle doesn't approve of Jane and does not give his acceptance of the marriage. This puts Jane and Mr. Lefroy in a pickle. Do they run away and marry and risk being outcasts from their families and having little money or do they find wealthier mates to marry?

Anne Hathaway isn't that great in this role. She's not British and it shows. Also, the story doesn't have a lot of conflict or action; therefore, it moves along slowly.

FINAL VERDICT: OK, but seems like it lasts too long. But, if you like period movies, then you will like this."

Permalink",True,"Becoming Jane was in my opinion the most incredible love story i have ever had the fortune to watch. It was filled with action, despair, heartbreak, endearing characters and of course the real heart-felt emotion of love. When watching this film the sexual energy between Hathaway and McAvoy was incredible. You could almost feel the emotion between the two of them.

I began watching this film with a stigma in my mind of Jane Austen, who she was, what she was like, her personality, what her life must have been like, etc. But as i began to actually view the movie and become engrossed with the characters and the emotions, i was surprised to learn more about her than i had ever thought possible. Yes this is an adaption of just a few simple facts but i feel that this film portrayed her in the best of lights, and she would be proud to be seen in such a way.

You could really take away a sense of every one of her books being portrayed in her life. She was like all great writers, she wrote about what she knew best, matters of the heart. Now we all know she died a middle-aged woman without a husband, so one must have wondered where she dreamed up all of these fantasies, and ""Becoming Jane"" showed the reason Jane wrote about love.

This movie was an adaption of the journey Jane went through to become the independent woman she was. The trials and tribulations she encountered on her way as an outspoken young woman full of ideas.

Becoming Jane is one of my all time favorite movies, although the ending was not the fairy tale ending Hollywood expects, it was truth. She had experienced love, and she would never forget it, ever.

Permalink",False,"I was excited to see this movie, seeing as Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy are two of my favorite actors. Both have done critically acclaimed work (McAvoy in Atonement and Hathaway in Brokeback Mountain), so I expected this to be a tender character study of Jane Austen and her suitor.

And while this movie had a beautiful landscape, it mostly just bubbled on the surface of the matter and failed to dive more into more of the undertones, simply staying on the story of ""This is Jane. She's different. This is the guy that's in love with her. This is the other guy she must marry, who she doesn't love."" It's a very simple plot that has been used countless times, and therefore it could have been about anybody, not just Jane Austen. After a while, I found myself getting rather bored, and by the end I didn't even care what happened to Jane or anybody else.

The actors in this movie were great and tried hard with what little material they were given. Not just Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy, who were the leads and did an excellent job, but all of the supporting characters were good too. The mother and the brother were underdeveloped and underused, and deserved much better than what they were given.

If you're interested in the life of Jane Austen, Becoming Jane will give you a mild, tame portrait of her pastural life, but you will leave feeling unsatisfied."

Permalink",True,"this is absolutely one of the best romance films i have seen in years. i am a huge fan of period pieces, i.e. pride and prejudice, atonement, etc., and i loved the way this movie worked. the first time, yes i was disappointed with the ending not being entirely happy, such as pride and prejudice, but it was the second and third time through that the witty and sarcastic humor and very intelligent script caught my attention. james mcavoy is stunning in this movie. his manners, idiosyncrasies, and personality are perfect for the character. one who has even heard of pride and prejudice would know immediately that tom lefroy could be the inspiration for the infamous mr. darcy.

there are several scenes that moved me nearly to tears. especially, the ballroom sequence in which jane is dancing with a most unfortunate mr. wisley, when suddenly the music picks up and mr. lefroy begins to dance with jane. mcavoy's presence and expressions, as well as anne hathaway's, made me watch this scene over and over. the two paint a beautiful picture of what it means to be in love and yet unsure at the same time.

also, the scene in which jane and tom discuss literature in the masculine and feminine sense, i thought was one of the most elegantly witty pieces of dialog i have ever heard. i thought, ""enough to know your horizons must be...widened,"" was very clever, as opposed to ""broadened horizons."" mcavoy should be commended for his ability to portray this cleverness in such an accurate sense for the times.

also excellent, was the scene in which jane visits London and their hands briefly touch before walking upstairs. it is small insights such as this that make the movie especially touching.

to me the ending is incredible. you know he never truly loved anyone but jane merely by the expression on tom's face at the very end. it is sad, yes, that she never marries, but the depth of the relationship as portrayed by these actors is phenomenal. i will say that overall, mcavoy outshines hathaway in this movie.

the other characters are very good as well, but the two of them are just incredible in this movie. i highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of romance, pride and prejudice, or just great fiction all together!

Permalink",False,"That Jane Austen is one of the penultimate authors of the 19th century is undeniable. Without exception, all of her films have been turned into films. From her lesser known NORTHANGER ABBEY and PERSUASION to her more popular SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and, the crown jewel, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Her characters' romances have inspired writers and made women swoon. But where did Jane get her inspiration? BECOMING JANE tells usin no uncertain termsthat life frequently imitates art. We're shown, however, that Jane's choices were often in direct opposition to her writings. Jane never married, had only one true love, and was shunned by the literary community of the times because of her sex (women who wrote fiction were often considered scandalous).

Connections between her stories and her real life are shoved down the viewers' throats, making true discovery by the movie-watcher impossible (""Oh look. That must be where she got the idea for Mr. Darcy."" And, ""Oh look. That must be where she got the idea for Emma."") The list is long and exceptionally easy. The complexity of her stories didn't match the simplicity of Becoming Jane's screenplay is what I'm saying.

The relationship between Jane (Anne Hathaway, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA) and her one true love Tom (James McAvoy, ATONEMENT) is well played but leaves little doubt about where Ms. Austen came up with her Darcy personae. The ending made this an easier pill to swallow, which also raised my rating of the film (it is in keeping with the times that Ms. Austen grew up and the restrictions placed on those people of money and property, and those without).

This film also points to a sad end for Ian Richardson, who died soon after the film's completion. Richardson plays Judge Langlois who lords over Tom as his uncle (Richardson is known for his amazing TV repertoire ...from BLEAK HOUSE to THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES) Tom (McAvoy) is Judge Langlois' heir apparent, and is forced to do the unthinkable when given the choice between love or money (or family abroad). In true sacrificial fashion, Jane refuses him his sacrifice and, in the end, chooses the life of an unwedded old maid. But she has her writings, and uses them to insert herself into a life she should have lived (living vicariously through her characters).

No doubt Becoming Jane was also Hollywoodized, making Jane's life seem more interesting than it was. Liberties with film will always be taken, though. It just depends on how much that irks you as the viewer. For someone as important to literature as Ms. Austen, it might be more irksome than entertaining."

Permalink",True,"Anne Hathaway, who had done research and a paper in college on JaneAusten, plays the title role. She is shown as a member of a not-so-wealthy working farm family, and who enjoyed a wit and had a knack for writing things. In this account, her meeting and knowing Tom Lefroy had a profound effect on what she became.

Scot James McAvoy is Irishman Tom Lefroy. He aspires to be a lawyer, but is poor. He meets Jane and her family is a forced temporary stay in the country, as a sort of punishment for his wild ways, drinking and fighting instead of studying to become a gentleman.

At first Jane is put off by Tom, but is taken in by his charm. They eventually wanted to marry, but Tom's wealthy uncle, a Judge, was not in favor of it, to the point that he would cut Tom off financially if he went through with it. This would not only affect Tom, but also his family that he sent money to.

So Jane and Tom were not to be a couple, and there is a touching scene near the end, perhaps 20+ years later, where Jane and Tom have an encounter, and Jane meets Tom's teen-aged daughter, who is named Jane and who is a fan of Jane Austen's. So the Janes walk away, with a connection that few appreciated.

A very good movie, as it allows us a glimpse into the life and situations that influenced Jane Austen and molded her writing style.

Permalink",False,"We all know Jane Austen wrote remarkable literature about the social tissue of her Age. Her books place her amongst the greatest writers of all times like Flaubert or Maupassant being more joyful and less mean and pessimistic. However this does not mean that the author's life is equally interesting, or that every period of it is worthy of our attention.

I am saying this because ""Becoming Jane"" covers so little time from Austen's life that can be considered a fragment of a bio-pic. And while some can argue that the beginning of her career should be the most interesting part of her life, I'd say that every period in a writer's life matters. Writers like all human beings evolve and ""idolizing"" them in their youth to discard their elder years looks like giving them a ""celebrity"" treatment, which is unfair, to say the least.

Anyway, here we see how Jane engaged herself in the pursuit of happiness and eventually managed to become a great author. So another problem arises. Great personalities are not what they are simply because of the facts of their lives. Experience plays some role, surely we live and learn, but there are other things, too. The character of Jane here shows no sign of passion and she looks so ordinary and clichéd that ruins the whole movie. It's more like an A+ B = C procedure. But if that could be true for Jane then any woman that passed through marriage problems could be a great author. Thus instead of stressing out the writer's personality this films erases it missing its purpose.

Anne Hathaway surely is a gorgeous woman but lacks the charm her role desperately needs. She maintains a sweet face through the film and shows almost no expression, thing which does not allow us to understand her character's feelings. In all, I am sure somebody like Keira Knightley could do way better job than her. James McAvoy is a brilliant actor but suffers because his Tom LeFroy role is pretty clichéd too and does not offer him a fair chance to demonstrate his talent. His role is like a guide for the young author, helping her meet the joys of life but never shows any charm or wit. Veteran actor James Cromwell adds a fair but sterile performance lacking any tenacity.Maggy Smith also appears, quite predictably, we should add.

There are positive elements too, mostly on the technical aspects. The movie has a rather nice atmosphere, some scenes are well-executed, but boredom prevails... The ending finally gives us a glimpse of Austen's psyche and caps up the whole movie quite nicely but it comes way too late, leaving the viewer pondering whether a focus on the elder Austen could be more interesting and captivating.

In all it's a decent movie that fails to reach into Austen's soul and show us her unique talent and the events that helped her bring it out into the world"

Permalink",False,"This is a lovely movie, filled with excellent performances. Jane Austen, the woman, is pretty much a mystery. She was not widely recognized as the great writer she was until the 1900s, so after she died in 1817 most of her correspondence, that could have given historians a better feeling for the person that was Jane Austen, was destroyed by well meaning, though shortsighted, relatives. I, personally, like to believe in the story of a great love that, for monetary constraints, was not allowed to be consummated in marriage. How else could Jane write so well about love if she had not experienced it?! Granted, one does not have to be a murderer to write convincingly about murder, after all, I think most of us have been mad enough to murder at some point in time. I believe love is different and I accept the idea that Jane and Tom shared a love that lasted their whole lives. I really enjoyed the way the writers had Jane speak the same sentiments, in the movie, that her written characters speak in her books. Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy handled their roles masterfully, were totally believable--my heart broke for them. I recommend this movie and now have my own copy of it which I will watch many times, just as I watch Pride & Prejudice, again and again. I own the 1940 copy with Greer Garson, the 1995 with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth and the 2005 with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. Jane's works are timeless."

Permalink",True,"I am a hard Jane fan and have read about her life also. Have the books the movies even the theater versions. This film was so boring to me I almost wanted to fast forward thru just to see how they would end it. It had so many places where you saw all of her other books and movies in it that it made it seem like you were watching pieces of pride and prejudice, sense and sensibility and at times persuasion and then even mansfield park. It was like they were putting these quirks in for her to me as pieces of her novel heroines or something. I mean change them up a little will you. I was not amused. Then at the end to try and give us a piece of joy by that ridiculous daughter scene. It was as if nothing was accomplished upon. You never really feel any passion from them. If their love was so genuine why did they not portray it more vividly so you could at least feel the lose of it in the end. Or maybe make her seem more smart and not just maybe, just maybe a little romantic. I saw a thrown up passion almost at the end just a hint of it and then it ended. I saw no real even passion for writing. Only thing that I saw was she had different men that wanted her but she ended up with none and died a spinster just like her real life but I am sure she had to feel more love and passion than what they offer here. I really feel this could have been better. I would have liked for her to be more forthcoming in something if not writing then at least in love. There was no ""ump"" to this portrayal. I was very disappointed.

Permalink",False,"I am not a Jane Austin reader, and hold no opinion of her work, good or bad. I can enjoy the odd chick flick-- once or twice a year. And period pieces can also be enjoyable. Something about this movie didn't really grab me or speak to me however, even though bits of it were very good.

Mostly, though, the characters moved around on the screen like people ""acting."" It reminded me of seeing plays produced at Uni, or community theatre type productions. Not bad, but not transparent, either. That is, the professional and paid-by-the-day sense of a bunch of film industry workers were thickly and obviously visible, instead of fictional characters and a story ""come to life."" They never ""disappeared,"" as it were, to allow the fictional reality and fantasy of a genuinely engaging movie emerge and command the audience's attention. Hardly anyone seemed to be a real person.

They mostly seemed to be mere actors employed to read lines and pretend to be real people. There were some bright spots, to be sure-- and Ann Hthaway was pretty good as Jane Austin. But either the chick flick mentality prevented me from suspending my disbelief enough to get into it (BTW, I am not a chick), or the acting was of the ""B"" movie category--- kind of like TV or soap operas. Sort of fake, sort of wooden. The acting technique and theatrical attempts were more obvious than any sense of getting one's self involved in a genuine story. At no point did I forget I was watching a ""produced"" movie with paid, modern employees filling in the supposed historical roles.

Not that this makes it a bad movie. The audience at my showing was all female, and they seemed to ""oooh"" and ""aaah"" at what were, evidently, the appropriate moments. But I was left enjoying the scenery, the old buildings used for filming locations (Question: Did those Georgian era buildings and interiors look old THEN? I think not...).

So, if you're a dood, and you want to take your lady friend or wife to a movie she might like, try this one. Have a couple of pints first, though. One, that'll numb your brain a bit so you can stand it. Two, it'll give you a legitimate excuse to leave your seat in the middle of the show and visit the Gents, without irritating your date. You might be able to score another pint, too, and grab a fag while you're out in the lobby--- plus the bonus of saving your bum from 15-20 minutes of fairly slow and amateurishly done period melodrama."

Permalink",False,"Becoming Jane is an excellent movie, that tugs at your heart and makes you eager to have an enormous love like theirs. The actors are tremendously fantastic, and the love story is a lasting one, unable to forget. All the actors should be commended by there talents, especially James McAvoy, who plays the lead male character. He is simply great and unknowingly steals ever scene he embarks in.

If you are a person that appreciates beautiful scenery and real unforgettable love stories, than this is the movie for you. An if you don't appreciate love stories and not a hopeless romantic, then I suggest, ""Becoming Jane"" is not the film for you. This movie keeps you on the edge, guessing and rooting for the main characters love to last. Its sweet and well acted, and will probably become a classic in the near future of great love stories of all time. ""Becoming Jane"" is a tearjerker you hopeless romantics can't miss!

Not to mention the leads: I had already seen James McAvoy in The Last King of Scotland and I thought he did a great job there. But watching him as Tom here really made me see passion. As for Anne Hathaway, I have always thought her smart and funny, and here she also shows her sensitive side.

Permalink",False,"When the film begins, it is quiet and humorous. Jane is awake before the rest of her family and, when attacked by writer's block, takes out her frustration on the piano and, thereby, wakes up everyone else in the house.

From the beginning you feel like you're walking in in the middle of the film. Important characters go through the whole movie without clearly stating their relationship or names (such as Jane's sister, who is reminiscent of the elder Jane Bennet in Pride and Prejudice and a young deaf man named George who seems to be Jane Austen's brother, although it is never made quite clear.) I felt that Anne Hathaway was an odd choice to play the part of Jane Austen. She has an all-American look, her British accent was only very slight, and she is too modern-looking, in my opinion, for a period film such as this. I'm guessing that she was mainly cast because of her popularity and because she often plays free spirits who are thrown into against-the-odds situations. For me, it was a poor choice. Her acting was competent, but I couldn't get past the fact that I was watching Anne Hathaway playing a part. I loved her in The Devil Wears Prada, but here she stuck out--and not in a good way.

James McAvoy is a cute, mischievous suitor about whom everyone disapproves in the movie. I had seen him The Chronicles of Narnia and in Rory O'Shea Was Here (a great little film if you have the chance to see it.) One professional review I read said that he would have made a great Mr. Darcy. I'm sorry, but I beg to differ. McAvoy is good at playing self-deprecating, rebellious, and scrappy. He isn't dashing, polished, and gentlemanly--the qualities with which everyone associates with Mr. Darcy. Fortunately, he did fit the character he played in this film, so any Mr. Darcy comparisons are irrelevant.

The film's look was competent, but unspectacular. Great actors like Maggie Smith and Julie Walters were given little screen time--much like in the Harry Potter films--and stole every scene they were in. James Cromwell played Jane's father, a minister with a randy side when alone with his wife.

All in all, I would say that the movie was fair, about 3/5 stars. I enjoyed it, but I found myself looking at my watch. I don't need to see it again. I don't need to own it on DVD. Most importantly-- anyone who looks up Jane Austen's life on Wikipedia or anywhere else will discover that the advertised ""extraordinary romance"" does not end in a nice little package, which begs the question, what is the point in showing it?"

Permalink",False,"As a man, I am probably not expected to enjoy the works of Jane Austen, much less a semi-biographical film of her life; yet, as I took my wife to see this in celebration of her birthday, I found myself completely engaged in the story and thoroughly charmed by the acting, music, costumes and settings.

Many have commented about how speculative this film is - whether or not the events portrayed actually occurred. Whether they did or not, it gives one food for thought as to the impeccable detail Ms. Austen gives to her characters, their circumstances and surroundings in her novels.

A fan of action/adventure movies, and comedies, I walked away agreeing with my wife that this was a movie that needed to be added to our growing movie collection when it arrives on the shelves in DVD.

I have seen worse action movies, but not many better dramas."

Permalink",False,"An excellent film, with stunning cinematography, sublime music, a great script, and a superb ensemble cast. Maggie Smith is always a pleasure to watch, but the hero & heroine walk away with this one: both Hathaway & McAvoy are riveting. What's missing? Miss Hathaway should work on her posture: the modern gait (of a young woman used to jeans & trousers of various sorts) & the awkwardly convex shoulders betray a young woman not accustomed to the light, skimming tread of proper young lady of the 19th c., when weeks of concentration were devoted to carrying the upper torso as if it were being served up on a platter -- shoulders lowered and rather square, back flat. Modern women walk from the hips, extending their entire leg in each stride. Women of a daintier age were trained to walk from the knee, in short, quick paces that gave the illusion of gliding over the surface, and hems & skirts were always held in at least one hand, raised up some inches above the ground. Floor-length skirts were only allowed to trail indoors, to reduce laundering needs. But these are details... I was quite surprised by how exceptionally well done this film was. Bravi!

Permalink",False,"This movie could be better, although second half compensates. It's a little puzzling in the beginning, since there were many characters, and relations between them are not reflected enough in detail. Those scenes might have been slightly longer to grab the viewer, I think. Comparably, second half is thrilling, with less and focused characters.

Lefroy (James McAvoy)'s acting is very good. He knows how to show the emotion he likes like he did in Split. For Anne Hathaway, I watched her many times, and this is not the best of her.

In overall, this is a good summary of how Jane Austen came up with Pride and Prejudice.

Permalink",False,"I can't say that I actually know much about Jane Austen, but I know quite well that she was an honorable English novelist that has left a great mark, and that's why I was expecting much more than what I've experienced in the movie. A movie about such a great writer, I think, should be more dramatic, sophisticated and elegant. There is no enough emotion or monologue in the movie to get the viewer into the character as in any other touching biography. In contrary, the movie is a kind of prosaic for me and humorous in a bad way. It would have been better if it was more deep and sentimental as for an admired writer. Personally I don't think that this is an appropriate biography for a remarkable writer; it did not enrich me, and sadly the movie is just light, tasteless, superficial and a kind of disappointment.

Permalink",False,"I absolutely loved Anne Hathaway in this but then again I love all her films. I think she played Jane very well and captured the struggle between love, growing up, family expectations and independence. Jane Austen was far beyond her time and I'm glad that more people will get a chance to learn about her through Anne Hathaway who is so much like her. Only bad thing about the movie was the casting for the male lead. I did not like the actor that played Tom and saw no chemistry between them. I felt that he looked too young and made me root for the rich man instead of ""true love"". I would have even preferred the man who played Henry to be Jane's love interest since they had great chemistry. I would recommend for a Sunday of Netflix-ing but not as a favorite.

With Anne Hathaway, Dame Maggie Smith and Julie Walters all involved you'd hope for a better film than what we actually get.

Slow, dull and all in all not that entertaining, this film manages to provide us with information but seems to be lacking the fun in doing so.

If you want to learn more about Austen I suggest you visit Bath instead. Or better still just read the novels. You can then draw your own conclusions about how Jane became Jane Austen.

A love story of one of the greatest authoress in English, Jane Austen, that I will never though that it could be so interesting like this... But the weakness in this movie, which is also the supremacy, is the conversation they have along this movie... With an unique British accent and so many difficult words to understand, it pretty annoying me, knowing that my English wasn't very good at all... Anne Hathaway herself did a pretty good job as Jane Austen with her accent, her charm, and also her beauty... But what captured in my mind is she didn't fit enough for the role as Jane Austen... In my opinion, Keira Knightley would be the best cast as Jane Austen in this movie... Especially because they have James McAvoy as the love interest of Jane Austen here... I think the chemistry that Knightley and McAvoy already had in 'Atonement' were be great if they doing it again in this movie... But after all, we should gives a thumbs up to Anne Hathaway... At least she's been trying to put some good performances with her own unique accent here but for me it wasn't good enough...

Permalink",True,"I'm glad I didn't watch the movie with some sarcastic companion mumbling about the how it's distanced from the history, or how the lines and costumes in there are anachronistic, because not all of the audience are professionals, inspecting the movie with their pedantic X-rays. There are kids assigned to watch the movie because the teachers want them to be interested in the classic author, there are couples borrowing the DVD because they want to watch something romantic at their date. Honestly, most of the audience open their laptops, expecting a good story. If some ossified dusted scholars want some historical truth, they go to the BBC. So I'm perfectly satisfied with this brilliant piece of work, it's got twists in the plot, fervent love between two sexy intellectuals that make you sign with pleasure, and the demonstration of Jane Austin's admirable character dominated by ration, moral and firm faith in love. It's definitely the movie to go if you are teaching your child what kind of lady you want her to be, instead of Hanna Montana or Mean Girls.

I've read the original version of P&P, it was a sheer torture for a 15-years-old teenager, but when I precede and encounter Mr.Darcy between Jane's gentle touch of pen, I became obsessed with it. I flung two subjects in the semester exam because I was at the part when Elizabeth was confessing her poignant misunderstandings towards poor Mr. Darcy, my heart writhed in pain because Mr.Darcy was what sensible girls always dream of :handsome, intellectually equal with Elizabeth and has a HUGE CASTLE. But it makes the departure of Tom devastating to watch, because the audience and sense the wistful romance in P&P when Jane was torn apart from her man in so disappointing a manner. I can perfectly understand the authors that fulfill the holes in their lives with happy endings, because that's where fancy originated from. In this light, the movie makes perfect sense, because every quality Elizabeth Bennet exhibited, Jane perfectly embodied them, and every thing Jane yearned for, Elizabeth had them eventually.

I will not judge the acting, because it brings out the softest and most beautiful part of my nature. I'll not judge the camera angles, because it's flexible and smooth like the eyes of god. I can't judge the script either, because it doesn't abuse a syllable. If Anne Hathaway is more linear to Jane's appearance, this movie totally deserves a ten.

Permalink",False,"Although I can be considered a Jane Austen addicted, it took me a long time before watching this movie, since I feared it was a melodramatic, sentimentalist and inconsistent pseudo-biography of the English novelist. Indeed, my fears were confirmed when I saw it, the movie proves much inconsistency, and has nothing to do with Austen's life and inner world, as it can be inferred from her novels, since we do not know much about her biography.

Let's say that this story between the roguish Tom Lefroy and her is pure fiction, this man in only mentioned twice in Jane's letters to her sister Cassandra, but no love story has ever been recorded. I think the director and the producer, on the wave of Jane Austen's cinematographic revival and success of recent years, aimed at making a pleasant, audience-attracting movie (and in fact they chose an Anne Hathaway, whose stunning beauty is by itself attractive, but very far from Austen's physical appearance). They made a work of juxtaposition between her literary production and her quite unknown personal life, and interpreted her life according to the plot of her novels, mainly Pride and Prejudice, but again disregarding the true nature of her inner struggles and motivations. This improbable, mainly considering Austen's secluded and never independent life, love story is romantic, seductive, but the complexity of her inner world and the world of her heroines, is totally missing.

In this way, the final product is enjoyable, the always charming English (and Irish) locations contribute greatly to an overall agreeable perception. Whenever I see or visit some English countryside, or mansion, I immediately fall in love with them, that's why I could probably never dislike such a movie completely , but it totally missed the point, and leaves much to be desired, in terms of rendering something vaguely true about the English novelist (but this was not probably the point of the production, as I said before). In the end, the movie can be viewed as a pleasant, amusing, and well acted fiction of a young, beautiful lady, fond of Jane Austen and trying to experience in life what she read in novels, wanting to become Jane but never turning into her."

Permalink",True,"I enjoyed the early flirtation scenes between McAvoy and Hathaway (the fact that they never became Tom & Jane to me signifies to me that the love story was not well done) but was surprised by their sudden profession of love. I thought that a few more scenes in between there were necessary.

And I know that it was intentional, but the direct quotes from Pride & Prejudice were exceedingly annoying. I think that implying that Jane couldn't have written those gorgeous words without having heard them in a real-life context undermines her skills as a writer.

The fact that it was shot in a style similar to Joe Wright's version of Pride & Prejudice was also quite disturbing.

I did not mind the unhappy ending, after all everyone knows Jane Austen died a spinster. It was, however, unaffecting. I wanted the movie to have the same heart-wrenching experience that is Pride & Prejudice (after Darcy leaves after reading the letter about Lydia) or at the very least (to remove myself from Austen, briefly) the feel of the end of The Age of Innocence.

To be fair, it is not the fault of the actors that the movie did not evoke that feeling. McAvoy does quite well at affecting Daniel Day-Lewis-esquire suffering in the last scene... And Hathaway was neither remarkable nor awful.

Permalink",False,"At the risk of sounding ungallant, let me begin by observing that Anna Maxwell Martin, who plays Jane Austen's sister in this film, is a comparatively plain actress, or at any rate photographs as such, and is here made up and photographed to look even plainer than she is; as is Julie Walters, playing her mother; whereas Anne Hathaway, the film's Jane, who is comparatively pretty, is made up and photographed to look prettier than she is. Moreover, Martin and Walters have been dressed to look of the period, or so it appeared to me, whereas Hathaway has somehow been costumed, or her costumes tailored, for a Hollywood costume romance; so that the other two tend to look like her servants. The heroines of other Jane Austen films haven't needed the scales tipped so much in their favor--which is to say, they were better. And here my ungallantry must be qualified, or redirected: Martin, in her plainness--if she is plain--is to my eyes a much more attractive woman than Hathaway in her prettiness--if she is pretty--and to both eyes and ears a much more interesting performer; Hathaway, in interviews, comes across as bland and nasal and dull, and so do her characters on screen, including this one. According to interviews on the DVD Austen was teenaged when the experience here being dramatized is supposed to have happened; Hathaway seems to be in her 30s (except in a final scene where, apart from her want of grey hair, she seems twenty years older than Austen lived to be); according to the interviews Austen was lively, disrespectful, and boat-rocking and that was how the filmmakers wanted to show her--well, they picked the wrong woman to do it, for Hathaway's Jane comes off as cold and hollow and schoolteacherish, in fact as a pill. However, learning of the filmmakers' intent clarifies the title, which I hadn't understood before, since the film does _not_ show Jane becoming anything: she's writing at the beginning, she's still writing at the end, and she behaves identically throughout, with only minor modulations.

I take it that the details of this story, or almost-story, are mostly unknown and were mostly worked up for the film; two of the incidents seemed new and interesting, the rest seemed borrowed, from Austen's novels and from other films. The photography looks as one would expect; indeed, so many of the shots are so exactly what I'd foreseen that for a while I expected a half parody, like Shakespeare in Love. The secondary characters--with the notable exception of a (presumably) real-life Lady Catherine, played by Maggie Smith--are little attended to, especially the lesser males: Leo Bill, who made a likable Edward in the latest Sense and Sensibility, barely registers as the boyfriend of Jane's sister, and whoever played Jane's happy-go-lucky brother is just an echo of Austen's Tom Bertram. The music sounds unaccountably Irish--unaccountably, that is, until one finds out this is an Irish film.

Yet in the end I thought the film worked, in a way, despite its oddities and deficiencies, and despite my having to watch it around the central character (cf. Kevin Costner's Robin Hood). I believe this was due primarily to James McAvoy as Austen's love interest, and secondarily to Laurence Fox as his opposite; they're believable, complicated--largely but not wholly likable--and ultimately sympathetic and touching; and through their eyes, rather than through the actress's performance, I saw Jane Austen as she might have been. The feeling they conveyed was not a sense of great tragedy or blighted romance, more a wistful regret for something that it would have been nice to have but that wasn't practically possible; like a feeling recalled from childhood of having gone to a party at a fancy house and having thought, oh, why can't I live in a house like this?--not the sharp pang of heartbreak but the dull ache of a disappointment known to be unreasonable, the recognition of it, the resignation to it, and the bearing with it, partly in retrospect; and since life is largely a procession of disappointments discovered, accepted, and borne with, both at the time and in retrospect, the film inevitably strikes a chord."

Cinematography, Costume and the line of story is almost perfect. Anne Hathaway Performance as Jane is piece of perfection.

Her anger, confusion and hesitation to make her decision is something you can feel. Her struggle to accept her father's advice telling her 'Nothing destroys spirit like poverty' and facing it when he came back home after running away with Mr. Lefroy is the most dramatic scene of this movie along with the scene when she finds out that Mr. Lefroy's daughter name is JANE and she express her deep, true love of hers just but looking Mr. Lefroy.

The most impressive moment of this movie is when Jane is reading her novel for Mr. Lefroy daughter. She definitely wants her to be her own daughter. It is so sad to have to feel like her for each of us.

Permalink",False,"I now have a fear that this piece will be ignored by the masses. While I love the works of Jane Austen, I do not claim to know much about her life. I've heard of the historical ambiguity of the idea and I will not make any judgments on accuracy.

But, gosh dern it, this made a darling little story.

Here we see a young, pre-Pride and Prejudice Jane struggling with her poor family. It's nothing truly terrible--they get by, big sister Cassandra is engaged, and brother Henry is a soldier. But of course they are always looking for money to get by; once Jane's parents die, she will have no money whatsoever.

But she won't fear. She's an independent woman with the confidence to believe that she could survive on her writing. This isn't a popular notion, and everyone around her would prefer to settle down with the local nobility's nice young nephew. Alas, Miss Jane wants romance! Which impromptuly comes in the form of a penniless law student. Sparks fly and the next thing we know Jane and Tom are head-over-heels in love. It's a cute, fun romance reminiscent of the romance of her own novels--it actually inspires her to write them! Do not forget, however, that Jane is poor and lives in a world where money is necessary.

I honestly did not expect much when I entered the theatre. To be honest, it's not the best. The filming aims for a more artsy side which doesn't always make it through and Ms. Hathaway's English accent isn't quite perfect. There were scenes that many viewers might consider boring. But the characters are determined to make a good movie and they march through to earn some well-deserved applause.

What I think made it work was not only some more-than-decent performances, but a discussion of ideals and reality. Jane gives a marvelous definition of irony that weaves its way through the movie as a motif. The role of the woman is discussed. And then there is the age-old debate of love vs. security. In many ways this is not a happy movie (I cried), but it is honest story-telling, even if not historically accurate.

If you're looking for a good drama and a glance at the possible personality of one the most famous female authors ever, this will be a great choice."

Permalink",True,"I'd like to first make it clear that I enjoyed this film and James McAvoy's charming and sexy performance puts this film on my DVD purchase list. At times it did remind me of Pride & Prejudice 2005, but it fell a bit short, (primarily because this story wasn't written by Jane Austen!).

We truly know very little about the flirtation between Tom LeFroy and Jane Austen, so much of this film is speculation. I had to keep reminding myself that this was fiction and not biography, lest I be offended at the filmmaker's liberties.

I cringed a bit at the sexy bad boy being portrayed as more desirable than the less exciting, maladroit, available suitor (Mr. Wisley), and I felt bad for the nonathletic, socially awkward gentleman (who is made out to be a bad guy so that you don't feel too terrible for disliking him because he's unattractive). With maturity one learns that the ""nice guy"" when given the chance can be just as desirable. Truth be told, when Mr. Wisley talks with Jane by the brook at the end of the movie, and you see that he has good character, you start to wonder why she wouldn't try to get to know him better, since many men who at first seem awkward and unsure, can become exciting and desirable on closer inspection.

There are many funny and charming moments in the movie (even unexpectedly from Mr. & Mrs. Austen), and Anne Hathaway did a fine British accent with only a few minor slip-ups that are completely forgivable.

Tom LeFroy's descendants will probably cringe at the way he is portrayed (although I quite enjoyed it, he's yummy!) but it was hard to see why this scoundrel would fall for Jane. In addition, the story has him deciding to run off with Jane, despite the financial ruin that will come to his own family (they are depending upon him for support), which might make one respect him a little less.

Despite the film's problems, I loved the humor and the passionate, romantic parts and because I am a romantic at heart and was perfectly willing to suspend belief for the sake of 2 hours of entertainment, I did ultimately enjoy this movie.

I thought James McEvoy acted his passion for Jane very well. I was expecting a real Jane Austen Biopic when i first heard of the movie, i'm sure there would have been enough material for it. I would have loved to have seen the REAL Jane and the REAL moments of her life that inspired her novels. I also believe that Jane was plainer in real life and it was her wit, independence and intelligence that marked her out. My only critique of the film is it made every aspect of her life relate to Pride & Prejudice and this was not the only book she wrote. I don't know how much of the film was based on fact, i'm pretty certain she never eloped with anyone, Anyway for a romantic period drama its still worth watching.

It is not a very good period drama either. Cassandra wears a dress that looked like it had just walked out of the 1960's and even the coaches looked a bit to early for this period.

I would recommend it but if you are a fan of Austen, keep well away as it makes her look like a lovesick woman who only wrote to keep her mind off the man she loved.

Permalink",True,"Anne Hathaway plays young author Jane Austen and James McAvoy plays her lover, Tom Lefroy, in this fanciful version of the author's early life. Lefroy is dashing and sophisticated, and makes quite an impression on country girl Austen. His motives are sincere as it turns out, but he has difficulty persuading his proto-fascist uncle (Ian Richardson) to go along with the plan. Meanwhile Austen is caught up in a plan to get her married off to the son of a rich woman (Maggie Smith). Her parents (James Cromwell and Julie Walters) are worried about her future prospects and don't really believe that she can make a living as an author.

The film bites off more than it can chew really, but might have been decent if not for the fact that Hathaway and McAvoy have absolutely no chemistry on screen together. They just are not an appealing or believable couple, at least after their romance begins outright. McAvoy in particular has his talents wasted in a somewhat one dimensional role. The whole resolution of the conflict towards the end seems arbitrary. Also Maggie Smith could have played a more interesting character, instead of a caricature.

I blame the director mostly, because there are a lot of decent elements here and it should have at least been a passable film instead of a waste of time. There just seems to be no focus to all the proceedings. Everything comes together in a very haphazard way, with basically an endless stream of ""chance"" meetings between the two lovers comprising the middle portion of the film. The script is not very good either and could have used severe trimming. For example there's a scene where Austen visits Ann Radcliffe (Helen McCrory) to get some pointers apparently on being a female author. The whole scene feels completely functional and has no real place in the narrative; I almost cringed when the idea of them visiting Radcliffe was awkwardly brought up at the tail end of an important dinner scene with the elder judge and the lovers. If I had a copy of the script I suspect that line would be in pencil.

This film might satisfy some fans of period films who are mostly interested in the nice costumes and scenery, and the actors in the film mostly carry the film to the extent that it's not quite as painfully obvious that the script is a turd. If Jane Austen's novels had been as obvious and as lacking in charm as this story, nobody would remember her.

Permalink",False,"As a fictional movie, this movie was visually appealing with good character development and very good acting. I am tempted to give it 9 out of 10 stars.

Unfortunately, the main fault with this movie is that the story is completely fictitious and there is no attempt to ensure that the audience knows that. Yes, Jane Austen had a brief flirtatious romance with Tom Lefroy, and did dance with him, but that is about it. Jane liked him very much and he later in life admitted he had loved Jane in a ""puppy love"" sort of way. However, the movie puts Jane, as a devout clergyman's daughter, in situations that she never would have consented too. Tom himself was known to be deeply religious, highly principled and devoted to his goal to serve in the Irish courts. Additionally, at the time he met Jane, he had had already established a connection of sorts with Mary Paul, whom he married two years after his brief flirtation with Jane.

The final four inaccuracies that bug me: 1)Jane was not writing First Impressions (Pride and Prejudice) when she met Tom, she was finishing up Elinor and Marianne (Sense and Sensibility.) 2)At the time, her cousin, Eliza de Feuillide was being courted by Jane's brother JAMES, not Henry. (Years later Eliza did marry Henry and he was Jane's favorite brother.) 3) Although Jane did have an older mentally disabled brother named George, he did not live with Jane and the rest of the family. As was custom in that time, George lived with a different family in a neighboring village who cared for him. Jane and her family had little contact with him. 4) The film leaves out her brothers James, Edward, Francis and Charles, who were very involved in her life.

Bottom line: Good movie, but not much bio in this biopic."

Permalink",True,"There is absolutely no information given us for why JA and Mr Lafoi fall in love. We know only that he is penniless and she wants to be a writer. But there are so few scenes between them that I couldn't fathom what basis there was for committed relationship, let alone passionate love! The writing and character development are so thin as to be non-existent. They start off repulsed by each other and there is nothing shown as to why they suddenly want to run off together. Much as I like Ms. Hathaway and Mr. McAvoy as actors the material given is so lean and lacking substance that neither can pull it off. As my wife said, "" if you've seen one Jane Austin movie you've seen them all!"" I don't quite agree with that, but Le me put it this way, If Jane Austin herself had seen this dull piece, she would have been mortified! They would have been better off creating a fiction, since this movie doesn't come close to any of the JA movies heretofore released. In sum,a waste of time and not worth renting.

Permalink",False,"18 February 2008. The serious dramatic look at the real Jane Austin is directed for its integrity. What's fascinating is the production's raw look at the period of the early nineteenth century and how it deviants from Jane Austin's more idealistic visions of her famous novels. This carefully crafted movie, avoids the more sweeping polished mainstream look and goes for the gritty period movie effect. What's interesting is its avoidance of the traditional period era presentation and its use of more directed script that is almost a look behind the varnish and polish and yet avoid a scathing look at all the dirty laundry as if keeping with the times. Unfortunately, this balance between a contemporary look at the time and the attempt to incorporate the authenticity makes for a less than spectacular movie. It's difficult to weigh in on Ann Hathaway because she's both good and distracting. It she had gone the way of Nicole Kidman in THE HOURS with a more drastic make-up presentation, it would have been more clear about her role. The emotional chemistry and the moral/ethical dilemma of women during this time is well portrayed and captured here. A decent quality production without flaws, yet it doesn't quite have the bite of a true classic. Seven out of Ten Stars."

Among the issues addressed, focused on that historical period, we find the difficulty of combining literary work and family for a woman, the economic and social importance of marriage for the rich class people, the intellectually restricted role of women.

It's not enough to have British accents and some period clothes. You need good writing and a compelling plot. Mildly diverting to see how they tried to show the sources of various Austen characters, quotes and plots, but really not art.

Watch any BBC or Hollywood production of an actual Austen masterwork again rather than this. It's rare that I stop watching a movie and I really wanted to like it, but it was not good at all. Austenland was more fun if you want an Austen-related but not Austen movie.

Permalink",True,"As ever the old adage holds true. No matter how good the cast a film will fail if the script is weak. This was. Despite a stellar cast (and one of the great Ian Richardson's last appearances). This was not so much a biopic as a drama constructed from various scenes from Austen's novels.

Yes, the lady wrote from life, from her own intimate world but she observed acutely. Of course her characters are based on people she met, knew, or watched but to flagrantly take scenes from her novels and imply these were events in her life takes things just too far.

And how on earth could they shoot a film about Austen entirely in Ireland? Where was Bath? Austen lived there for five years and her father is buried there!

Permalink",False,"I remember seeing Pride and Prejudice many years ago, it is a beautiful film and I am told that the book is even more splendid. This film about the author behind that and other books in the genre is a very rich tale of love, class, nobles and the mob :)

It takes place in the country and London, but mostly far away from anything, so the scenes are very vivid and full of color and natures brisk attitude. The acting is like taking them out of an old book and especially Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy do a splendid job, but the rest of the cast and crew have worked hard to make the personalities, with quirks, errors and lovely characteristics stand out.

I was entertained, having read nothing of her works and knowing little about her other then the name, well I had nothing to cloud my impression.

Permalink",True,"As a Brit I feel a certain guilt at not being very conversant with Mss Austen's work in contrast to so many Americans who seem to know how often she changed her socks. When I was at school in the 1950s she had not yet come back into

fashion and Virginia Woolf was the token woman in Eng Lit. So how much of ""Becoming Jane"" is fact and how much fiction I can't vouch for. Miss A.Hathaway plays her as a clever young woman,but not clever enough to disguise her intellectual superiority to all the men in her circle,which would have left her little option but to have sought work as a Governess had she not been able to translate her intelligence and wit into that relatively recent phenomenon the novel. By using much of Miss Austen's own words,the film risks being labelled - rather like ""Hamlet"" - as OK but too full of quotations. However that is not the problem I have with it. ""Becoming Jane"" is,unlike it's subject,rather tedious. Mostly played on one note,with supporting parts played firmly acted in BBC bodice - ripping period style and only the wonderful Miss Anna Maxwell Martin showing any individuality. Miss Hathaway does fine but I suspect Jane Austen would have sounded rather less Oxbridge and more Ambridge. As we all know Miss Austen never married the impact of her being dumped by Mr Lefroy is slightly less than startling. The scenery's nice,the lighting and sets are good...but the whole thing seems a bit.. I don't know...pointless?

Becoming Jane is a speculative portrait about a young, love struck (pre-fame) Jane Austin and centers around the romance she had with a penniless Irish Lawyer.

At times I felt like I'd seen this all before and while I should have been all caught up in Jane and Tom's ill-fated romance I was kinda meh, whatever about it. Although that formal dance they have together was something else (its all in the eyes.)

It is a good movie and the entire cast is fantastic; James Cromwell, James McAvoy, Joe Anderson, Maggie Smith and I really got a feeling of being transported back to 1795. What a frustrating time to be a woman. 01.18.14

Permalink",True,"The movie shows the life of Jane Austen before she became a writer, her relationship with Mr Lefroy and her struggles with her family. The movie deserves and A for effort. The costumes are good, the scenario's perfect, the set accurate, the supporting roles great. But those are not enough to make you over look the main problems: -The story line is confusing at some points as the love story's development is sudden and out of the blue. -The performances of the leading actors are bad. Or maybe I was destructed by the luck of accent. Jane has no English accent, or a bad one at least, and Tom, well, he supposed to be Irish, but he sounds more like a Londoner. - The make up is bad also, there soon have been made a better work especially with the on the future scene. - The story gets boring after the first arguments of the characters. So 3 out of 10, because it was in the mood of the Jane Austin films, but that just wasn't enough.

Permalink",False,"It wasn't that I expected a historically accurate film. Enough time has gone by since its release that just about everything that could have been said on that score, already has been.

No, it was the two-dimensional feel of all the characters that disappointed, as though they didn't quite believe in themselves or this story, and they seemed almost ghostly by comparison with the wonderful characters in Jane's novels. I expected much more from a BBC movie.

The scene was beautifully set and very accurately depicted, and could scarcely be faulted but because the plot was so thin and the characters so unconvincing my attention kept wandering. I even dozed off for a moment or two at one point. I was glad I was watching a DVD as I had to backtrack a couple of times.

If you like historical froth this movie is OK but I honestly think Jane Austen would have disapproved of it, and not because of its content concerning her brief involvement with Tom Lefroy but simply because she would not have recognised herself."

Permalink",False,"Today Jane Austen is recognized as one of the greatest writers in the English speaking world. Not so in 1795 when this story takes place and she's a young woman who wants to marry for love something unheard of in those days.

Jane's middle class parents have a suitable match for her. Dull Laurence Fox who has some family connections to some of the landed gentry in the Great Britain of George III. But Jane sets her sights on James McAvoy, a wild Irish lad and both the wild and the Irish are objected to in equal parts by parents James Cromwell and Julie Walters.

Anne Hathaway who does a wonderful job playing all kinds of bright and eager young women is a bright and eager Jane Austen. In an age when women tended to the sewing and weren't supposed to have opinions, she has them by the wagon load. No one, least of all her parents will tell her whom she is to love and marry.

As for McAvoy, he's a lawyer and a wild child who likes to have a bit of fun and delights in slumming at the grog houses and even getting into prize fights. Those matches were long before the Marquis of Queensbury set down any rules as you'll see.

The passion does burn bright between the two, but as we know Jane never did marry and died relatively young. Why is what you see the film for.

Hathaway and McAvoy will charm you as Hathaway goes on her life mission in Becoming Jane."

Permalink",False,"This is an imagined semi-biographical story of Jane Austen. It's around 1795, and Jane Austen (Anne Hathaway) is a rebellious young woman before her great works. She forms a combative relationship with rogue Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy) while her family wants a more aristocratic match in Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox) and stability of money.

It's very doubtful that this has much relationship to reality, but it's still a very good movie. Hathaway and McAvoy are great young actors, and they have magnetic chemistry. It's really an interesting way to create an Austen-like story by using her own life. And I do like the ending and the depressing tone no matter how little it has to do with her true life. We must allow for poetic license. I do wish for a faster start to the drama. Once it gets started, there are great performances such as Julie Walters as Jane's mother in addition to the two leads. I like to think of this as a Jane Austen novel that she never got to write herself.

Permalink",False,"Boy did Hathaway look like Audrey Tautou - the first I've never been a fan of and the second I adore. When I saw that Hathaway was the lead I almost slammed the laptop lid down (I doing my eveningly search for a pre-bed movie). But I gave the film a shot anyway, and I'm actually glad.

Probably because of her Princess Diaries stint, I found that she reminded me at times of a Disney princess, but despite my qualms at having her act the part of Austen, she managed her britishness surprisingly well.

The film wasn't astounding, but for someone who enjoys Jane Austen or just needs a period (drama) fix, Becoming Jane hits a spot. It has some really intelligent quirks that helped too, that narrowed the divide between our ""self-indulgent"" social present and our ""rigid"" social past; bringing the audience in (I loved the coach scene). However, these were intermittent.

I am an avid, crazy fan of Jane Austen (even as I was watching I was consumed by the desire to crack open one of her novels, but sadly they're all at my dad's while I am not. :( ) I sobbed like a freak'n child and I rarely cry at movies! This is what got me to crank the score up to seven and even deliberate an 8 (but my sanity intervened).

The story is imagined, fan or not keep this in mind. But I was swept into it because of my love of J.A. If you are, and aren't going to be pedantic about the nerve of those men and women who dared to channel their creativity into the creation of something fictional, then you may enjoy this.

I personally thought that the banter felt forced, not so much in execution (which could have been done better by the leads) but it seemed the writers were aiming to get too many four syllabled words into too small sentence perimeters, and thus the intended wit fell short of being powerful.

Beautiful shots, pretty costumes, pretty people. A fictional ending I really connected with and that made the movie worth the watch for me (I was dragged along with the happy couple through the forest, tears streaming down my face in the knowledge that Jane never marries DRAGGED *pulls face* ).

On a real note though, the premise was very... simplistic. They were short on facts to fabricate and lack creative initiative. The title ""Becoming Jane"", in collaboration with this premise, insinuates that Jane the writer was a result of some very sad, impossible love (and, as was mentioned in another review, the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice...)... Though mildly irritating that she has been reduced so, many films are made with the same tried and tested ingredients, not pushed to some new level. Lucky for no one, I had enough imagination to pull my way through the film and enjoy it.

Very pretty and nothing excruciatingly wrong with it except the reduction of Jane to this event in her life. Nothing entirely special, as it is a reduction, and a very easy peasy one at that. It's a serious period (drama) fix for those who like costumes and peeks into the past, and Austen.

I thought director Jarrold's choice of locations excellent; the atmosphere of mid- to late eighteenth century England was lovingly recreated through use of light and shade; the performances on the whole were well drawn. As the action unfolded, however, I felt that BECOMING JANE lacked originality; it seemed to include every single cliché associated with the heritage film. There were scenes of coaches arriving and departing from historic buildings; panning shots of oh-so-verdant landscapes accompanied by soft violin music; Jane Austen (Anne Hathaway) took a walk in the forest accompanied by the Darcy-figure Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy); not to mention the frequent ball-scenes in which Jane flirted with Lefroy and rejected the unwelcome attentions of Wisley (Laurence Fox). Not to mention the presence of Maggie Smith and Julie Walters, part of the Great Pool of British Acting Talent, in the supporting cast. With all this visual display at his disposal, it's not surprising that Jarrold's narrative unfolds in a slow, leisurely manner. In the canon of Austen-related adaptations, BECOMING JANE is a minor entry."

Permalink",True,"Events from the life of the author Jane Austen inspired this romantic historical drama,Becoming Jane which speculates of a romance that may have had a significant impact on her life and work. It depicts the early life of English author Jane Austen and her posited relationship with Thomas Langlois Lefroy. Anne Hathaway stars as the titular character,Jane Austen while her romantic interest is played by James McAvoy. Also appearing in the film are Julie Walters, James Cromwell, and Maggie Smith.It was directed by Julian Jarrold.

Twenty-year-old Jane Austen is the daughter of Rev. Austen, a minister who looks after a flock in a small rural community in Southern England with his wife. While her older sister, Cassandra, is engaged to be married, Jane resists her family's efforts to match her up with Mr. Wisley, the wealthy but dull nephew of Lady Gresham, a minor member of the British nobility. Jane has the heart of an artist, and hopes to distinguish herself as a musician or a writer, though her parents don't think much of her prospects. When Jane meets Tom Lefroy, a young man her own age, she's intrigued; while he scoffs at her writing style, he clearly sees she has talent, and is eager for her to learn more of the larger world by exposing her to more daring literature and modern pastimes such as boxing. As Tom begins to court Jane, she finds herself increasingly attracted to this poor but keenly intelligent man, though she soon realizes her own ideas about love and marriage are sometimes at odds with the conventions of the society in which she lives.

Anne Hathaway gives a radiant performance as a young, love-struck Jane Austen in the witty and engaging movie.With a spot-on accent and altogether charming performance, she makes another convincing statement that she has grown, as a woman and as an actress.And with her performance,it is an enchanting and imaginative film you'll fall head over heels for.

Permalink",True,"Having grown up near Steventon, I have to confess I'm not familiar with the mountainous terrain that appears in parts of this film. Luckily I'm sensible enough to recognise that this isn't attempting to be a wholly accurate biographical work. It uses elements of Janes life, people, places etc. in a fairly loose way to construct a plausible work of fiction about how things might have been. Ultimately, unless you were expecting a detailed biographical work, the success of this film isn't about how accurate or inaccurate the depiction, its how well it works as a piece of drama. In my view it worked very well. So well in fact it's difficult to pick out the flaws. It was in the construction of this films Jane, that I think things didn't quite work. The critical factor in determining her future was where this would leave her and her parents financially marrying Lefroy or alternatively marrying Wisley. For some reason this critical and monumental part of the story failed to carry anything like the same sort of weight it might do in an Austen work. It almost got there in several places - the scene where she screams something about ""are there no other women in Hampshire"" I thought was particularly good, but instead of building and building the drama, here and in several other points throughout the film, things just sort of dissipated. My other criticism (and this may be just a male thing) was the sheer beauty of Anne Hathaway throughout. She is a fantastic actor, her performance and accent were flawless and I believe she deserves to appear in work with far greater artistic merit than generally seems to be her lot. In this role however, and I think largely due to artificial constraints of Jane's characterisation rather than Anne Hathaway's acting, she just wasn't quite ordinary enough. That may seem a strange thing to say about a fictional depiction of one of the greatest writers the world has even known, but it's not about Jane Austen's extraordinary gifts that I mean, its about how mediocre much of Austen's life was, that crucial part of the back story was insubstantial and, possibly because of the characterisation of her parents, not quite believable.

The film is based on a true story of Jane Austen's life and resulted in me wanting to know more about her and the life she has lived. Her story is fascinating, and the other movies that I've seen based on her books were wonderful. Austen is a strong character and she is worth knowing.

I first watched this film a little over a year ago, but after seeing it for the second time a couple of days ago I fell more in love with it.

This is a must see film! You will not regret it.

Permalink",True,"The movie itself is very light, loosely based on Jane Austens's life, because no one knows exactly if she had such a romance as we see in this movie, as her sister burned all her letters after her death (Jane's death, not the sisters).

It's a love story and we understand from the beginning this will not have a happy end, so fans of tragic love and sadness, rejoice! Jane is poor, the love of her life is poor, plus he's got a lot of brothers, sisters, poor parents and a rich tyrant uncle which does not approve of Jane. Conclusion: Jane gives her love up so that they don't end up poor and unhappy. I do have to say that this conclusion is a very mature and sensible one and seldom seen in movies, where usually no matter how many problems there are, the hero and heroine walk away into the sunset without a care in the world.

So the story is pretty thin. The cinematography is nice, British landscapes and nice houses, pretty dresses and all that. Anne Hathaway is OK, but I expected more personality and wit from her character, being Jane Austen. I'm much more fascinated by her cousin, who being rich can afford to marry her lover, the penniless soldier. She's independent and has a sharp tongue. The real treat of the movie is James McAvoy,who's a nice eye candy, plus his performance is not bad at all, his inner conflict between love and duty depicted very well, shining eyes and flushed cheeks. I think the scene where he just runs and kisses Jane in the forest will make a lot of women hearts beat a lot faster.

A nice period drama-chick flick, enjoy it, but don't expect a masterpiece.

Permalink",False,"For a fan of Jane Austen and such, this movie was incredibly made and has many perks and conflicts to which we young women can relate to. Jane Austen was an amazing character in herself as she, while living, may not have known. I would have like to have been there with her in her process of writing, though she kept most of her works secret and under other male names rather than her own for the sake of literature. But, she also had many romances and love stories of which we may not have known.

This movie covered me with joy and love. Anne Hathaway was a very good advocate for such circumstances in a film. She uses her emotional and witty female side that most of us don't know we have. I have always looked up to Jane Austen as an influence in my life, not just through writing, but through independence and individuality. She gave her all into doing what she loved. This movie portrays Jane Austen just as it should have. I should think that it would make more money. In my opinion it was Phenomenal! After watching it, I went into a fiery frenzy of writing and listening to classical era music, such as the movie soundtrack (also phenomenal). Please, if you are a Jane Austen fan like me, watch this movie!"

Permalink",True,"I watched this movie for help with my coursework (Austen's life) and as it happens, the movie is less than 25% fact. It's generally assumed that Thomas Lefroy was her inspiration behind Mr. Darcy and most of her male leads in her works (quite understandable).

Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen, wasn't bad, considering how much she DID try and succeeded to some extent in molding herself in the classic author's character. She wasn't perfect, of course. (I doubt anyone can be a perfect Austen especially when it's Austen fans doing the comparison). Hathaway played the English-nonconformist considerably better than Kiera Knightly did in Pride and Prejudice. Sadly, however, where the whole cast fits perfectly in that era, Hathaway seems very out of place in some parts (and I'm talking of more than just her accent), and well, it's like she's playing two people. Her body language is not that of a witty, observant lady (who soon becomes the author of time-honored works).

James McAvoy, on the other hand, fit very well in his role, the time period and among the cast. The first time I watched the movie, I knew McAvoy from Narnia only, and i was skeptical if Mr. Tumnus will be able to play a convincing 'hero', who'd leave you yearning for a happier ending for Jane; but arrogant, impertinent, smart, bold, dashing and even tender, McAvoy was perfect as the male lead. In some places, his acting even over-shadows Hathaway's. The library scene and then the final ball, for example.

Overall, the movie is worth watching if you are prepared to overlook some minor flaws here and there AND are also prepared to feel not a little, but thoroughly sorrowful. Unlike Austen's works, the movie goes from merry to tragic (which although is explained in the movie by Jane to Cassandra, is pretty unexpected for those who do not know about the life of Jane Austen). The soundtrack is pretty good too.

Permalink",True,"It is a bit odd to say this, but I only remembered it was a biography about Jane Austen halfway through the film, from director Julian Jarrold (Kinky Boots). Basically 20-something Jane Austen (Ella Enchanted's Anne Hathaway) was an emerging young writer of novels, seeing the world beyond class, convention and constraint, and she also does not see the point of marrying, unless it is for true love. Her parents: father Rev. Austen (James Cromwell) and mother Mrs. Austen (Julie Walters) are looking for a wealthy suitor, they like the look of Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox), nephew of Lady Gresham (Dame Maggie ). Jane however has met Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy), who at first she may be annoyed by, but they soon have a spark, but they cannot marry, otherwise thy risk their friends' and families' fortunes. In the end, Jane became one of Englan's most famous novelists, writing seven successful books, including Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park and Emma, and she and her sister Cassandra 'Cassie' (EastEnders' Anna Maxwell Martin) never married. Also starring Joe Anderson as Henry Austen, Lucy Cohu as Eliza De Feuillide and Ian Richardson as Judge Langlois. Hathaway sports a good English accent, the supporting cast do well in their time, it may not be the most entertaining film ,but it s a good old-fashioned costume period romantic drama. Worth watching!

Permalink",True,"In this film starring Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy as Jane Austen and Tom Lefroy, respectively, the premise is one that is sure to intrigue anyone who has ever read an Austen novel.

Basically, ""Becoming Jane"" explores Jane Austen's early love life and how she came to meet the dashing Tom Lefroy, a would-be lawyer with a love of partying and women. I wouldn't say he's a womanizer, in fact, his laid-back personality only gives him the illusion of being care-free. Truthfully, Tom is indebted to his uncle (a sour sort of fellow)and his entire family back in his hometown of Limerick, Ireland depends upon him for their welfare.

""Becoming Jane"" has its flaws, yes, but the film has a few redeeming qualities that will undoubtedly give it a great following of fans. There are moments of great wit and subtly from the parts of Hathaway and McAvoy, and the film boasts some lovely cinematography, though it, on more than one occasion, seems to draw inspiration from Joe Wright's 2006 adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice."" This is shown in the dance scenes as well as in some of the dialogue, which, to a lover of that film, seems to be in poor taste.

I had a few complaints with the film upon watching it twice:

1) Anne Hathaway didn't seem to embody the striking and headstrong persona that was Jane Austen. Her accent slipped at times and I felt like she was poorly-casted. However, she obviously tried and her delivery of lines was good. My BIGGEST complaint, however, about her was the pitch of her voice. At times she would while attempting a British accent, go far too high in her voice. She seemed to be squeaking at McAvoy half of the time. (I still love Anne Hathaway, though)

2) Some of the dialogue was obviously placed in for humor and sounded cheesy and corny. Also, the mock-Austen dialogue where they tried to embody the way of speaking in Austen's books only works when McAvoy speaks.

Which brings me to the HIGHLIGHT of this film: JAMES MCAVOY! Oh, my goodness, he is excellent in this movie. He portrays the part of conflicted Tom Lefroy with such conviction and you cannot take your eyes of his character. He steals every scene; I am not kidding! I have written about another one of McAvoy's films and that review shares many of the same sentiments, but I promise you that I am not an addicted fan-girl, rather an appreciator of film and of good acting. Anyways, McAvoy brings dimension to a character who, played by anyone else, would have been flat and static. You really feel as if Lefroy loves Jane and his eyes burn with passion and regret in the later scenes.

On the whole, ""Becoming Jane"" is an average film with a heart-felt ending and a few excellent characters. It is a great showcase of McAvoy's talents as well as a vehicle for a new generation to become familiar with the always lovely Jane Austen.

Permalink",False,"'Becoming Jane' is quite stunning to look at. The sets, landscape locations and cinematography are wonderful. It is quite a well-crafted film. But, it's supposed to be a movie about one of the most respected writers in English literature and does it do right by the one and only Jane Austen? Well, the movie isn't entirely based on facts (as is the case with most Hollywood films) but what surprised me is how Jane is portrayed. Rather than being a rebel in this movie who became a feminist and writer and out of passion, writing is merely a backup option for Hathaway's Jane in case she doesn't marry the man she loves. I don't blame Hathaway for playing Jane that way (the blame goes to the director) because she's actually quite good even though at times a little confused and doesn't get the accent right in a few scenes. It is one of her better performances. James McAvoy shines yet again owning each one of his scenes. While talents like Julie Walters, James Cromwell and Maggie Smith are associated with the cast, they are utterly wasted as space fillers but I liked Anna Maxwell Martin as Jane's sister Cassandra. Jarrold's film also is influenced by Austen's own 'Pride and Prejudice'. Think of 'Pride and Prejudice' without a happy ending. I thought that was an interesting look at Austen's life and how she may have drawn inspiration from her own life to write a classic. Even, though 'Becoming Jane' arguably isn't factually accurate, I think it's an intriguing take on the life of one of the greatest writers."

Permalink",False,"This is a very moving drama which pretends to be true but is only partially true. The film aims to re-create a mythical world, if something which did not exist could be said to be re-created. The exteriors were shot in the beautiful Wicklow Hills of Ireland, which bear no resemblance to Hampshire in England. Anyone who has been to Jane Austen's village of Chawton knows that her house (which is open to the public) did not abut a huge ancient forest, and that there were no magnificent and grand sweeping views of hills and coombes there. In the film, we see Jane living in a rectory which is isolated in the depths of the country, whereas the real Jane would not have been able to avoid bumping into all her neighbours the minute she stepped from her door. The real Jane's life was thus claustrophobic, whereas in the film she seems to live on the verge of being wild and free, when she is not slopping the hogs (which it is doubtful she ever did herself). It was audacious to cast a girl from Brooklyn as Jane Austen, though the actress who calls herself Anne Hathaway (!) clearly has Anglophile leanings, and does a very good job. She manages to speak English, which shows remarkable talent and, frankly, is amazing. James McAvoy as Mr. Lefroy is very energetic and impassioned, and does a very good job. He looks very like my friend Charlie Anderson, though not as good looking. I think Maggie Smith over-acts in this film, or am I imagining it? Julie Walters, a great favourite of mine, seems barely there, and was probably miscast. James Cromwell is very effective indeed as the father. What one thinks of this film depends entirely on whether one wants historical truth or historical myth. Here we have more myth than truth. It seems hopeless ever to expect a historical film to be accurate, as the manufacturing of myths is the basic business of the film industry, where truth is a rare and despised commodity. The theatre has been described generically as 'lies like truth'. One might describe the cinema as 'lies like lies'. In film, illusion is everything. There is no use looking for reality on any screen, as it is not there. But then, there is this problem about real life as well: since most people live their lives based upon fantasies which have little connection with reality (false or demented notions, ludicrous ideas, crazy beliefs), and their actions are largely dictated by subconscious urges which they do not understand and of which they rarely even have the slightest conscious comprehension, what is reality, after all? If life is a dream, what is film? A double-dream? A dream thrown back in our faces? Films are imaginary, but how real are most people's actual lives? And this brings us to the question: how real was Jane Austen's life? She lived cooped up in an oppressive, ritualised, highly conventional society which would not allow her to have freedom of movement or behaviour, and she fled into the realms of the imagination. What is real about that? I suspect that Jane Austen, if she is out there somewhere and has seen the movie at The Aethre (a possible name for that great cinema in the sky) must have had a hearty laugh and must still be giggling. A girl from Brooklyn with a Shakespearian name swooning over James McAvoy in the Wicklow Hills? Why not? In fiction, anything goes, even attempts at pastiche biography. If it makes you laugh and cry, it must be OK. Let's say this film is a lovely experience and leave it at that."

Permalink",False,"This is the story of how the young Jane Austen (Anne Hathaway) lost her heart to a young Irishman Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy), and how the social complexities of the times impacted on their lives. It is filled with fine performances from a host of great character actors like Julie Walters and James Cromwell (as Jane's parents), Ian Richardson (as Lefroy's Uncle) and Maggie Smith (as the local wealthy Duchess).

Two shining minor performances to look out for: Jessica Ashworth as the pouting teenage girl who develops a crush on Lefroy and - more briefly - Helen McRory as novelist Mrs Ashworth, who is visited by Jane on a trip to London.

This is not the most original film ever made, but it is well-done, and worth watching for the performances and period detail.

Permalink",False,"This movie was amazing! It was full of love and romance and that's what makes a movie great. It was great! I love how they picked Anne Hathaway to act as Jane. Jane is calm and sweet and when I watch a movies with Anne I feel she is calm and sweet. Anne pulls me into the movie and when ever I thought I had figured it out I was wrong. I also saw a connection between the two main characters and I like when that happens. I saw the preview for this movie and I wanted to see it because it takes place in ""old times"" and the love story. I really like movies that take place in the old days. I think it is cool to see how people were then. It's also odd to see people back then, because they had forbidden marriages and there were arranged marriages. Now that doesn't really happen a lot. Not in this country any way. I just thought this movie was amazing and I recommend this movie to anyone who likes love stories.

Permalink",False,"Julian Jarrold gave us Kinky Boots in 2005, and now helms something I thought of as more solemn in tone with the biographical tale of literary legend Jane Austen in Becoming Jane, starring Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy in yet another period dramatic piece since Atonement. Here, they play star crossed lovers who get embroiled with the rigidity of class, honour and reputation back in Old England, with him being a legal student, and she, a budding novelist, where at the time isn't a career choice (if at all) for a female.

Sounds like Pride and Prejudice? Yes. If the movie is to be believed, then the love and life of Jane Austen served very much as the basis and seed for the premise of that novel of hers, and for an audience, probably ample opportunity to soak in the scenes that ring a bell, and compare Hathaway's performance as Austen to Keira Knightley's performance as her created character Elizabeth Bennet. The two characters couldn't be more alike, with one being almost an autobiographical account of the life she's facing as a single woman of marriageable age, and what more, being wooed by a Mr Darcy equivalent in Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy).

Also, the tale moved along quite similarly to that of Miss Potter, which tells of the story of the creator of Peter Rabbit, where we're plunged headlong into the critical crossroads of their professional life as well. Or like that of Finding Neverland, yet another adaptation of the life and times of JM Barrie, who gave us Peter Pan where inspiration is as chronicled in the movie.

I thought Anne Hathaway finally got a meatier, more mature role here, and what more, starring as a legend too in Jane Austen. However, I can't deny that her faux pas English accent was found somewhat wanting and proved to be a distraction of sorts. She did manage, though, to bring out the pain that Jane had to go through in having to hold out on love, find it, lose it, like the adage says, better to have loved once and lost than never at all. James McAvoy's performance here is a notch below that which he delivered in Atonement, probably because it's something that has already been done to death (not another Mr Darcy clone!).

The last 10 minutes was a kick too in seeing how visibly aged the characters become, thanks to wonderful make up. Other than that, sit tight for a romantic drama which as I mentioned, had much ado about Pride and Prejudice, that at times you might lapse into thinking it is that movie that you're watching."

Permalink",False,"Becoming Jane is a nice movie, but it could have been better. First of all, I think that it is a HUGE mistake to choose an American actress to play the leading lady who is unable to pronounce words in the English accent. I like Anne Hathaway and I believe that she is a great actress, but she was totally unconvincing in the role of an English girl. Because of the way she was pronouncing the words, they sometimes came out rather unclear. She did not portray the role as she should have done. She did not show Jane Austen's rebellious side of her nature. However, there was a strong chemistry between Hathaway and James McAvoy (Tom Lefroy).

When it comes to Tom Lefroy, I think James McAvoy did a splendid job. He portrayed Tom Lefroy's character wonderfully. He was full of charm and energy. He is a very talented actor with a great ability to play romantic characters.

All in all it is not a bad movie, but it could have been MUCH better.

Permalink",False,"Although, I don't put this at the top of my list of favorite chick flicks; Becoming Jane defies Hollywoods original blue prints of a romance story.

Usually in any love story, you have the person(s) who bump into each other and completely hate each other at first, but secretly really like each other. Then they keep seeing each other; a few obstacles get thrown in their way and at then they proclaim their love; get hitched and THE END! Not so, in Becoming Jane. Even though a lot of it is Hollywood fiction, it still paints a wonderful story of two people who fall in love with each other. The events that follow completely draws out it's own map on the lovers journey to keep the watcher's attention.

Becoming Jane is a spellbinding movie that will forever stand independent. It is a must see for anyone who is looking for a love story that's ""different"".

Permalink",False,"I haven't read her novels before watching film of ""becoming Jane"", so I express my views only for this film .

Wealth and emotion , which should we select for our lives? How should we balance them when they conflict ? Jane insisted on her belief that she would marry with the person she loved in deep heart ,not price higher. People with love are not always together at last as Jane and her lover.

I remembered Jane's mother told her that life only with emotion was not enough and wealth was indispensable to life . Jane said I could live with her pen .She believed people also could live happy even if he or she was not possessed of wealth ,but at last She realized responsibility for family was also important for people except emotion . so she gave up and said goodbye with her lover .As what she said, she lived alone with her pen . Her lover married with the other and his eldest daughter was named also as Jane.

I was puzzled why women could be single forever to love someone though they couldn't live together but most cases of man were on the opposite. Maybe women was born on emotion and man was born on sense."

Even worse, this movie starts with a social commentary advertisement. There is an anti-smoking leader with a street scene singer who had throat cancer.

Permalink",False,"I came out of this film wanting to find out more about Jane Austen, because I was incredibly puzzled by the references and her actions in this film. I have read all of her novels, but nothing about her specifically. Well, I'm on the hunt now. As I have Googled the film now, I've come upon ""not accurate, but still a likable film"". So in general people seem to like the looks of it and are happy to disregard the rest. Which I always find hilarious because the viewer and the critic are engaged in a film more when the powers that be, the ones that get the big bucks, put in the effort to do their homework. I really can't understand releasing a film with loose ends and inequalities etc...etc. Be that as it may. I hope this got viewers interested in reading Jane Austen's novels and reading more about Jane herself.--2/17/08 I just read a book on Jane and another film ""Miss Austen Regrets"". I was mistaken. There are no real facts about Jane Austen. Well, the majority of letters written by Jane were lost/destroyed. And the rest of the info is written by extended family that may or may not recall information selectively and prejudicously. It's all conjecture. No wonder people fantasize that her books are about her and that she had these ""loves"" in her life. So, forgive me dear filmmakers - you HAVE done your homework. Viewers - Please see this movie, but only after you've read a bit about Jane herself and follow it up with Miss Austen Regrets. As Becoming Jane is the beginning, Miss Austen Regrets in near the end of her life. Thank you"

Permalink",True,"This is a lovely account of Jane Austen's life and provides a nice insight into her romantic nature. You do wonder if it is a simple remake of Pride and Prejudice, but things turn out rather differently in the end. Personally I found the language a little overwrought at times, where they were trying a little too hard to convince us this is the 18th century. Though it does remind you when you read older literature and in particular diaries that our language has changed so much and actually our vocabularies have reduced by just as much. It is a joy to hear how beautifully they express themselves compared with your like average like teenager today not. James McAvoy is just as striking as in Atonement, that perfect blend of larrikin and cute little puppy that must be trained. Anna Martin as Cassandra (Jane's sister) has her every present slightly vulnerable and very sweet presence as I remember from Bleak House. Overall I recommend it for Austen fans or anyone who enjoys quality period drama.

Permalink",False,"Although Becoming Jane is a biography in nature, it is not entirely accurate. There were accurate details included in the film mostly involving the dynamics of Jane Austin's family. Jane Austin did have an older sister who never married, a brother in the military, as well as a brother that was hearing impaired. Her father was a minister and supportive of Jane's writing as the movie portrayed. As far as Jane's suitors are concerned, the movie embellished their characters greatly. Mr. Wisely cannot be confirmed to be a real person, although she did have numerous unnamed suitors. Mr. Lafroy was part of Jane's life, although the extent of the attachment was unknown. He did name his eldest Jane, but he could have named her after his mother Jane. Becoming Jane had an informative plot that helped us get to know this famous author. Unfortunately, there was a lot more to the story than what was able to be shown on screen, causing the film to lose continuity and simplicity. The weak plot caused audience to lose interest in the overall story. For example, there was no true climax, and the characters were very static. The acting was average; actors did a fine job portraying their characters but it seemed that they didn't go the extra mile to make the characters jump off the screen. Overall we found the entertainment values of this film to be poor, due to the weak plot and un-captivating characters. Throughout the film there were two main themes of being independent and being sensible. Jane showed this by living by her writings and by turning down opportunities to be independent of men. She proved that a woman could think for herself and live a complete life. Jane proved sensible by weighing out her decisions. She realized that life can't always be what you want, Jane had to sacrifice her happiness for the betterment of others. The film often equated money with happiness. It's amazing to think that because of the lack of money she couldn't marry the man she loved. But despite this she proved independent, and achieved what she wanted to become: a writer."

Permalink",False,"It is like someone bottled all the magic from Sense & Sensibility, Pride & Prejudice, and Persuasion and channeled it into this modernized tale of Jane Austen's life. Admittedly, Hollywood has its hand in the story line as well as the casting. Anne Hathaway, a marvelous actress to be sure, is too gamin faced to be playing a Regency Character. I was not sold on her attempt at an English accent, either. However, that being said, the chemistry between Miss Hathaway and Mr. McAvoy makes willing suspension of disbelief more than worth the effort. Mr. McAvoy is supremely wonderful in the role of Tom Lefroy. He delivers the role with his usual alluring sincerity.

**Spoiler**

One of my favorite scenes is when Jane is at a party, dancing, and not quite managing to surreptitiously look for Mr. Lefroy. The chemistry between them when she finally sees him, and dances with him, is so palpable as to completely captivate us and make us wish for a different ending. However, because she wrote her characters with such nobility, I am glad that this Jane Austen didn't throw propriety to the wind.

I very much enjoyed Mr. Johnston's music. The music is so heart achingly beautiful, I believe it's one of the reasons this movie haunts me. I see that the movie is already out on DVD in the UK. Let's hope they get cracking to release it here in the US."

Permalink",True,"I absolutely loved this film. The acting, the drama, the sets and clothing indicating that era. It was everything I loved in a costume drama. Filled with tear worthy scenes and brilliant scripting, it kept me gripped from beginning to end. Anne Hathaway gave an Oscar winning performance as the young novelist Jane Austin who finds true love with Mr Lefroy, but finds that life as a funny way of panning out. This was a worthy watch. Thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming as well as sad in parts I would definitely recommend this being watched, especially by Jane Austin fans as this gives us a bit of a glimpse into the life. This is definitely a film I can watch again and again.

Permalink",True,"This movie is fascinating in the sense that it takes the characters from the author's novels and writes them back into an imagined (largely) story of herself. This is not difficult because Jane Austen wrote about the world she lived in, accentuating the plight of the financially dependent woman. The closest resemblance is to ""Pride and Prejudice"", except that while Jane Austen found true liberation in becoming truly financially independent as a popular author, Lizzie Bennet's liberation is only partial, in finding happiness with a ""good"" husband. Comparison with the latest version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (2005) easily identifies almost identical characters: Donald Sutherland and James Cromwell playing the understanding and supportive father, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith playing the icy, autocratic upper class woman. Tom Lefroy, unfortunately, is not Mr Darcy as in Jane Austen's own story, not only the woman, but also the man, is financially dependent.

An interesting theme that we find only in ""Becoming Jane"" but not Jane's novels is: how does a woman author with so little experience (in life, and some of its ingredients such as sex) go about writing a novel that is convincing? Mrs Radcliffe, a successful author that Jane visited, suggests using a lot of imagination. Tom Lefroy has more a practical advice: go and acquire the actual experience. As this is easier said than done, Jane resorts to the next best thing: reading novels written by people who purportedly have experience, for example, ""Tom Jones"".

""Becoming Jane"" can be viewed as one of the steps for Ann Hathaway to becoming a major actress to be reckoned with. From the rodeo girl turned frustrated wife in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (where she has shown good potentials) she moved along to a major role in ""The Devil wears Prada"" in which she has to play against both formidable Meryl Streep and show-stealing Emily Blunt. Against those two, is it very difficult to hold your own and she was generally considered to have made passing grade. With ""Becoming Jane"" finally comes her chance and she comes through. Rarely seen on screen is such freshness and sincerity, bringing life to an imagined Jane Austen. Here she also has a partner who complements rather than rivals her. James McAvoy, who played so well against award winning Forest Whitaker in ""The last king of Scotland"" (2006), has fantastic chemistry with Hathaway, bringing out the best in her.

My last comment is quite inconsequential but I can't resist making it. It is one of the opening shots, showing Jane Austen's parents (James Cromwell and Julie Walters) in bed, just waking up in the morning. In the course of a conversation about perfection, Mrs Austen says, ""I've shared your bed for 32 years and perfection I have not encountered"". Without missing a beat, Rev Austen says ""Yet"". The next thing we see is the gentleman ducking his head under the blanket, moving towards the lower portion of the lady's abdomen, and then an expression of pleasure on her face. The movie makers surely know how to make the audience pay attention right from the beginning of the movie.

Permalink",False,"I found Becoming Jane very moving. It shows JA as an intelligent young woman who is also warm and loving. Even though much of the plot is fictionalized, it contains many real details from JA's life skillfully interwoven so as to make the suspension of disbelief quite easy.

The performances of Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy were both outstanding, hitting the right emotional key at all times. Hathaway could make your heart break for her. I believe she will win awards for this role.

The musical score is superb, something I have not seen even discussed in any 'professional' review. But then, most 'professional' reviews are written to display the cleverness of the reviewer with words rather than to fairly describe a movie's strengths and flaws.

Permalink",False,"This is a film that is rough around the production edges. The lighting in two of the outdoor scenes are harsh and contrasty; the shadows block up and there is a distinct blue tinge to the colour values.

Perhaps it was the print we saw, but the sound was often muffled - again particularly so in the outdoor scenes and the crowded scenes.

And that is a pity, because it interfered with hearing some of the exchanges between the characters.

And yet..

I liked this film very much. It got through to me. Instead of every last drop of period authenticity being wrung out of the scenes in order to show the film's mastery over them, the essential honesty of the emotions - love, naivety, experience, pain - is there.

There is great interaction between the lead characters."

Permalink",True,"I recently saw this film and truly enjoyed it. I did have to do one thing: forget almost everything I ever learned about Jane Austen.

Miss Austen is said to have hidden her chapters under letters when people came in and she was unlikely to have been quite so much like Elizabeth Bennet. The idea of her writing most of Pride and Prejudice in a single night, well.

But the story was lovely and it brought home one of the main focuses of Austen's works, which is that, like Mrs Austen says, ""Affection is desirable. Money is absolutely indispensable"". The difficulties, responsibilities and obligations of being a less wealthy member of the gentry make Austen's life a sad one, and the knowledge of how her life went kept me just a little bit sad throughout the courtship.

The actors were great (the cast was full of famous British (and one American) actors) and the chemistry between Hathaway and MacAvoy was stunning.

Permalink",False,"I went to see movie - Goodbye Bafana, but because the show was a charity show I had to select another movie to see. I selected Becoming Jane. I knew that this movie is a love story in historical British setting, and it is inspired from a brief love affair of Jane Austin.

The story is about well known British author Jane Austin (Anne Hathaway), during her early younger days. She being one of the two daughters of a poor clergy in rural village is sought after by the rich Lady Gresham's (Maggie Smith) son. But Jane finds love in one guest Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy). Jane is forced to accept Lady Gresham's offer to marry her son, but breaks it to run away with Tom Lefroy only to sacrifice the love in the end. The movie ends with unmarried Jane meets Tom who introduces his daughter named Jane.

The format of the story is very clichéd and while viewing it you would feel Déjà vu  of seeing it a thousand of times. In Bollywood this theme is so over exploited that for an Indian like me the whole movie was a sleeper. Said that, let me mention there were five saving grace of the movie. First, Anne Hathaway (Devil wears Prada)  she looks and acts brilliantly, and her eyes are so beautiful. Second, the cinematography by Eigil Bryld. He uses brilliant locales, lightings, camera angles, scenes and images to capture the canvass with beauty. Third, the editing by Emma Hickox, who inserts and uses very good images, closeups and long-shots in the narrative of the movie. Fourth, James McAvoy  again after The King of Scotland, delivers a spontaneous and lively performance with romantic ease. Finally the fifth is the one that made me rank the movie a bit higher than usual  the last half an hour of the movie, the finale. I think it was scripted and handled without cliché.

Overall a good attempt by the TV Director Julian Jarrold, who even though chooses to use run down story line to depict Jane Austin's life  delivers an enough polished version to make women feel goose-bumps while seeing this romantic love story of Jane Austin. No wonder that in IMDb males rate this as 6.5 while women at 8.5.

I rate it at 5.5 not because I am a male, but because I have seen this story so many times that for a few things mentioned above, I have to rate it higher.

Permalink",False,"Any of us who packed art houses back in the 1980's to see the new Merchant-Ivory productions of Elizabethan/Edwardian period costume dramas will relate to this film strongly. The story concerns a young Jane Austin (Anne Hathaway who glowed in Brokeback Mountain), in the years before she published her first novel. In an era where Women had their lives planned for them by staunch society, Austin was a rebel for her time by resisting against the ""pecking order"" mentality of the time. The films also gets some nice work from the rest of the cast as well (including the always welcome on screen,James Cromwell---last seen in 'The Queen',opposite Helen Mirren). Although this film is unfairly being chalked up as just another chick flick,is what I would call the perfect date film (provided,your date is versed in European social history,or 19th century English literature). About the only quirk I have with this film is the somewhat dodgy sound (a good deal of the dialog is spoken in whispers,making it somewhat hard to understand at times--and I have no problems with my hearing---plus other folk in attendance had the same problem that I did). Apart from that one tiny quirk, I would recommend this film to any & all open minded cinephiles."

Permalink",False,"Becoming Jane is a fiction. What historical drama is not? I'm always fascinated by the range of response to artistic license when exercised by others. Perhaps it helps sometimes to go in with less knowledge and fewer expectations so that the movie can be viewed on its own merits.

As a movie period piece, Becoming Jane has a lot to recommend it. The cinematography had some brilliant moments. The dialog is possessed of some truly humorous and acerbic irony. The actors work as an ensemble and individually. Anne Hathaway is unquestionably lovely and captivating. Jennifer Ehle is still my favorite from the various Austen-style movies, but Hathaway charms me consistently.

And Becoming Jane has a dark turn that presents the very irony admired by so many in Jane Austen's novels. I confess to liking sweet and romantic movies, but a bit of pathos can work wonders. Other personal favorites are An Ideal Husband, The Whole Wide World and The Last of the Mohicans. Becoming Jane is more cerebral than Michael Mann's Mohicans and less dark than Tarzan's author. The dialog is not as witty as Oscar Wilde, but Jane has its moments. Each of these offer interesting ties back to literary favorites. Jane worked on every level for me and is not a poor cousin to these fine movies.

There was even some fun or sport in translating the depicted life experience into the implied inspiration. As I know Jane Austen more from the recent movies than from the original books the game is not that different from finding an homage in other movies.

I took my wife and college-age daughter. We all gave it a 5-star (out of 5) ranking and enjoyed an evening of discussing what we liked. Bottom line we found an engaging story where we cared about the characters and could empathize with both their triumphs and tragedies. Becoming Jane is a visual treat with some depth in its own right. The immersive theater experience makes it easier for me to suspend disbelief or the inner skeptic. Perhaps this is a movie that requires that suspension of disbelief. If you know too much about Jane Austen the accumulation of fictions appears too much to bear for many, as evidenced by other reviews. If you are simply inclined to romantic dramas, you may react as I did. I fell in love and will watch this one again, probably several times."

Permalink",False,"I love costume dramas and am a sucker for Jane Austen's work, so I was delighted to hear about this movie. I just don't understand the negative reviews I've seen; when Mansfield Park was made into a movie a few years ago, there were raves because the screenplay incorporated some of Jane Austen's real life into the story. This movie sort of does the same thing in reverse, and doesn't it make sense that some of the events included in her novels may have had some basis in fact? I thought the historical attention to detail (such as wardrobe, etc) was very nicely done, and truly, I didn't find this to be ""too"" slow moving. Yes, it moved at a slow pace, but I thought it fitting to the subject matter. I didn't find it at all predictable, despite the fact that I did know that Ms. Austen never married...so anyone the least bit familiar with her life would also know what was coming, to some extent.

Anne Hathaway was marvelous as Jane, and James McAvoy was also a treat as her love interest. Both of these young actors have matured in recent years and I'm impressed with their choices of roles as time marches on.

I recommend this to people who enjoy this kind of movie. Obviously, if you usually enjoy adventure movies, there are lots of other choices out there for you."

Permalink",False,"I really must point out that the generous 7/10 rating is only there because of the beautifully enchanting opening sequence and simply perfect ending. Unfortunately the rest of the film was not exhilarating.

It is a fictional story of the life of Jane Austen one of the world's most beloved authors having written six best selling novels. There is not much difference to the story than one of the many, many films adaptations of her actual books. It follows the basic premise of Pride and Prejudice with an overly impertinent mother desperate to marry off her daughter Jane to a wealthy man. It is even more similar when Jane refuses a generous offer from one such man, and tension with her mother ensues. Jane meets a man, Tom Lefroy, who is young, attractive, and different most of the stiff and proper men she is surrounded by. As she falls for him and he for herwell you probably already knowthey are unable to marry because Tom does not have any money. He is completely reliable on his Uncle's allowance for support, an allowance that will be taken away should he marry Jane. As they try to figure a way to marry and be financially stable a secret is revealed and the story comes to surprising conclusion.

I am sure Jane's life was an inspiration for her novels but this fictitious tale seemed to similar to the umpteen adaptations we have seen of her stories to make it interesting enough. Also the film is called 'Becoming Jane', I assume meaning Jane Austen becoming a famous author, but I felt like the story never really showed much of her writing and coming up with the ideas. There were occasions that this did happen but not enough for my taste. One enjoyable thing, like all Jane Austen movies, is the locations and scenery are always breathtaking and a pleasure to watch.

Anne Hathaway plays the young author very convincingly, and James McAvoy plays Tom Lefroy with an intense captivating energy. The wonderful supporting actors, which include Maggie Smith, Julie Waters, and James Cromwell, all do wonderful jobs but are heavily underused.

Overall a movie that uses the same things over again to many times. I still am sticking to my original 7/10 rating because of the ending which is just so remarkable and also the skillfully timed and edited beginning."

Permalink",False,"One can count on a good performance from the likes of Maggie Smith who adds a light air to this stoic English flick. James McAvoy brings forth his role admirably and adds to his portfolio another A level star. However, one can only guess why Anna Maxwell Martin, who won a Bafta Award and critical acclaim (along with Gillian Anderson) for Bleak House,was left to such a minor insertion. Saying she was underused is really an extreme understatement especially in light of the fact that all these actors have talents that far outweigh the range of Anne Hathaway. Anne does not have to be ashamed of a decent performance but given the acting lot you have to notice that she was miscast. There are several actresses who could have taken this to the stage of a masterpiece given the status of her co-stars.

In any event, this film is worth seeing but I can render it only a 5 out of 10 due to a lengthly and mis-directed production and the use of Hathaway. However, the film is under wide distribution so it seems there has to be some give & take to get anything of quality out in the mainstream cinemas these days. See it for what it is--a nice walk through the English countryside with some very solid performances.

Permalink",False,"This film, from an artistic/writer's point of view, teemed with powerful emotions. I found the actors paid homage to deep, gut-wrenching emotions with their expressions and subtle body language. I am convinced this film was a Director's dream - working with such actors. The dance scenes and encounters between the two main characters were played out like the quote from the novel Tom Jones depicting the birds mating in flight,falling to their death (perhaps) as the female let out one loud climactic cry. EXCELLENT! The film also excelled with color-filled, beautiful landscapes as well as the choice of wardrobe color and fabrics. Not only was the script embedded with literal humor, there was much unspoken humor, such as the ""take a walk in countryside"" scene, which turned out to be more of an unpleasant experience than a wonderful walk with nature. Additionally, the desperation was as sharp and keen as the humor was subtle. This emotional roller-coaster led me to a resolved kind of despair which still lingers. Yet, I recommend this film to all romantics and lovers of literature and would see this film over and over again.

Permalink",False,"""Becoming Jane (2007)"" was directed by Julian Jarrold. It stars Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen, and James McAvoy as Tom Lefroy, a young Irish law student with whom she falls in love.

Most viewers will know that Jane Austen wrote novels that are full of romance and, ultimately, marriage. The film explores the possibility that her novels depict actual events in her life, and events that she wished had been in her life.

The acting is excellent, as is true in so many British period pieces. The countryside footage (mostly filmed in Ireland) is wonderful, and we get many scenes of elegant dances as well as the requisite rural folk, their customs, and their animals.

Julie Walters is excellent as Jane's mother, as is James Cromwell as her father. Maggie Smith, one of the world's greatest actors, is perfect as the very rich and very selfish Lady Gresham.

The restricted role in society occupied by genteel women is rarely mentioned, but obvious throughout. Even the most admirable woman could hope for little more than a ""good"" marriage. Also ignored is the fact that, although Mrs. Austen complains about having to dig her own potatoes, these women do not really work. Surrounding them are faceless, nameless people who are lower in the social pyramid. Although the Austens recoil from the prospect of drudgery, drudgery is the lot in life of the vast majority of women and men around them.

This is a fine movie and definitely worth seeking out. The only problem I could find with it is that Jane Austen is too perfect, and that Anne Hathaway is too beautiful. In the movie, Jane is a superwoman--compassionate, loving, charitable, witty, brilliant, athletic, and attractive. She certainly must have been brilliant, but it's doubtful whether any human could have all the other characteristics as well.

The camera loves Anne Hathaway, and director Jarrold must love her too. Jarrold places Jane in virtually every scene, shot from virtually every angle, wearing virtually every possible flattering costume. The camera lavishes all its attention on her, and the other characters in the film fade away. Still, it's a movie about Jane Austen, and Ms. Hathaway looks wonderful in late 18th-Century costumes. Who can blame Julian Jarrold for his choices?"

There are many possible moments when the end could have occurred, therefore this film does seem to drag at the end and interest in the story can be lost!!

The film stunned me and I enjoyed every second of it, even if it did feel slightly long. Whilst the film does not focus so much on Jane's writing, it does speculate about her life and the 'romance' between her and Thomas Lefroy. Although I discovered that the film is not historically accurate, I would still recommend this to anyone who enjoys a love story. In fact, due to the inaccuracies of the story, I would even go as far to suggest to just forget it's about Jane Austen and watch it as any other film! I left the cinema feeling thoroughly miserable! But only because the film did its work so well, and I found it refreshing to watch a love story that ends a little more realistically (the girl does not always get her man).

Overall I enjoyed the acting of all the cast, but I must make a special point to express how fantastic James McAvoy was! His portrayal of Thomas Lefroy was absolutely heart stopping; the only downside was that he was playing an Irishman, but did not have an Irish accent. This is the first film I have seen Anne Hathaway in, I felt that she could have perhaps have made her character Jane be a bit stronger, but she did the whole 'smitten' part superbly.

This is not my normal type of film, and I rarely enjoy romance dramas, but I'm afraid I turned into a proper girl on this occasion and was completely touched by the story. I think the main thing to bear in mind is that if you don't concentrate too much on what the story is supposed to be about, it's a cracking film. If you want it to give a credible tale of Jane Austen and her life, you may not be so lucky.

But if you are the average jane austen fan, you will be greatly disappointed and even insulted at this thinly veiled attempt to create a copy of pride and prejudice for the 2007 generation. it was trite, predictable, followed the pride and prejudice script almost verbatim, and had none of the wit, irony, and brilliant writing that accompanies a good austen novel. too bad. because it did have some good acting and cinematography. but they were completely over-shadowed by the poor writing.

Than, a friend told me about this movie and I've decided to see it, because I love Anne Hathaway. I loved every second of it, and after I finished watching it, I watched it all over again, and again, and again! I've never watched one movie four times in one day! I was so touched by the story of Jane Austen, that that very night I visited some online shopping sites and ordered every Jane Austen book I saw. I've read them all and now she's my second favorite author on the world! I think that this movie should be seen by every aspiring author, too see some crucial writer abilities (and, yes, I know that everyone's different, but there are some values that every writer must have).

Permalink",False,"This film is a fictional account of Jane Austen's romantic entanglements with a poor but charming lawyer, and a rich but cold nobleman.

""Becoming Jane"" has an interesting plot that does not follow the overdone Hollywood romantic film formula. There are more ups and downs than usual, which is a refreshing change. I am impressed by Anne Hathaway's acting, she conveys subtle emotions with much ease. And yet ""Becoming Jane"" fails to capture me. The pacing is far too slow for it to be engaging. I really hoped the filmmakers had made the dialogs faster paces and trimmed down the pauses, which would have paced the film much better. I am glad though, the film's final 20 minutes picked up, became more interesting as Jane has to make important decisions.

Overall, ""Becoming Jane"" is an adequate film. With a faster pacing, it would have been very enjoyable.

Permalink",False,"Obviously, you should not watch this movie if you are into the smashing, slashing kind of films. It can be deeply moving if you give it the chance.

Simply put, this movie is not perfect. You already know the ending to begin with, because it is well known that Jane Austin died a ""spinster."" I read up on the plot line and found that the events aren't even true (or at least proved). In my opinion, Anne Hathaway is slightly awkward about the British accent, but that may be due to the fact that well, she's Anne Hathaway. As you have to remember, they only have a certain amount of time to crunch in a bunch of events, so you don't get a lot of time to see how Jane Austin fell in love. It literally seemed like the relationship developed entirely on looks (James McAvoy is about the only good-looking bachelor in the entire film) or on a love-at-first sight nature. Which is by all means fine, but it is hard to believe that such a love would effect someone for their whole life. Again, to enjoy this movie, you have to believe in true love and not mind a slow-moving movie that shows a lot of moping.

On a good note, it has a good message behind it. It's something to watch on a rainy day or if you're looking for a movie that will match your depressing mood. James McAvoy's performance is absolutely flawless, and although I don't like her accent, I liked Anne Hathaway because she was able to convey emotions very well with her gigantic eyes. I liked this movie because unlike every other romance out there, their relationship is not based on sex or intense sessions of making out. Their love is innocent and conveyed without any of those things.

I recommend this for moms and fans of Jane Austen. To everyone else, I recommend you at least rent it so you get a piece of history while enjoying a beautiful movie."

I will definitely watch this again and recommend it to others. I was laughing and crying and racing for them to finally be together. It was a great romantic tale that was both funny (at times) and it was frustrating, it was a well rounded emotional movie, and my heart ached for the characters (Jane and Tom) . The film basically had all of the emotions, and it was everything a great movie should be. Movies that grab all of the emotions are the best in my book , and this was one of them.I will also be checking into more movies with James McAvoy as I thought he was brilliant. Kudos!

Permalink",False,"I've seen good work done by both Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy. So I watched the film with really high expectation. But I was quite disappointed at the end. I think the main fault is probably the script is just not engaging enough even I tried hard to love the characters. Also, I can't help but compare this film to the films made base on Jane's novels. E.g. Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and the Pride and Prejudice (both the 2005 film and 1995 TV mini series). Any of these films are much better choice than Becoming Jane.

Again, I don't think it is the fault of Anne Hathaway or James McAvoy. I might be wrong but I think the script can be much improved. If I had watched the film with a much lowered expectation, I might have been able to enjoy it a little bit more.

Permalink",False,"Really marvelous, and somewhat reminiscent of Miss Potter. I went into the theater with what I would call average expectations; they were quickly exceeded. I thought this film was casted very well, the costumes were wonderfully authentic as was the dialogue, the soundtrack was lovely, and the locations were fantastic. I found the plot to be clever and captivating, and in addition, the growth and emotions the characters display seems quite genuine. In general, I rarely admit that I become entirely engrossed in a film, smirking at comical remarks and particularly romantic scenes; likewise, I found myself feeling rather curious and rebellious, often mirroring the emotions that Jane feels. Truly, I felt as though I had fallen into Miss Austen's Hampshire forest and become a part of the story. The cast was superb, all of the characters brought passion and sparked life in a setting that some would describe as stuffy and dull. Although, Hathway is an American, I completely felt as though she more than lived up to the role's high demands (her accent being rather passable); she gives the character of Jane a spirit and life that is easily identified with by young women in audiences. But of course, how could I forget the delightful, and attractive, Tom Lefroy. James McAvoy melts into this role so smoothly and effortlessly, and honestly, who could deny his stellar looks and charm? All memory of him as a faun in the Chronicals of Narnia being pushed from thought, he has morphed into a charming British Dandy that is sure to flutter the hearts of adolescent girls as well as the rest of the general female population that is not blind. The chemistry between Hathaway and McAvoy does much more than bubble and simmer, it boils. In addition, Maggie Smith is a familiar face that once again works its magic (no pun intended with Harry Potter), Julie Walters (who also plays Mrs. Weaseley in Harry Potter) was simply fabulous, as was James Cromwell. The movie was brilliant, beautiful, witty, romantic, artistic, and real. Most of all real, which I believe Miss Austen would have greatly approved of: ""My characters shall have, after a little trouble, all that they desire."" --Miss Austen."

You could see bits and pieces of her own story that made it into many of her own books. I thought Ann Hathaway did a great job playing the role as well as the other characters. Worth seeing........however, sometimes the English language of the 18th century is difficult to understand especially when the actors are speaking low or too quickly.

Permalink",False,"""A woman especially if she has the misfortune of knowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can."" Jane Austen

Fortunately, Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen in Becoming Jane doesn't conceal her character's intelligence by her bearing and occasional quips, which are barbed missiles most of us supposed ""intellectuals"" would have been wise to avoid 200 years ago. Before her famous period, Jane Austen met a young Irishman, Tom Lefroy, and this rendition does the docudrama approach to imagine what happened between them.

With the exception of an exchange about Fielding's Tom Jones, most of the action in this pleasant biopic is probably fiction but based on Jane's character as it is filtered through Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, for instance. That a young girl of limited circumstances, such as a parson's daughter, should marry well is axiomatic in rigid early 19thcentury England. That a roguish young barrister who relies on a rich uncle to live a comfortable life should look for a wife among the wealthy is also de rigueur.

By falling in love, after the caustic interchanges that usually lead to affection in film and literature, Jane and Tom swiftly become as characters out of an Austen romance. Where the film disappoints me is those moments, such as with the Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith), where Jane backs away from a smart retort out of deference, undoubtedly proper activity at that time but unsatisfying dramatically since we have at the table one of the greatest communicators in the English language.

When she does argue with Tom's uncle, Judge Langlois (Ian Richardson), about the meaning of irony, like the film critic Ego's candid analysis of his trade in Ratatouille, the ""irony"" argument opens up new thinking about an old topic, just what you'd expect from a brilliant author. I need more of that and less realistic convention. A docudrama should try hard to reveal the genius of its subject.

But the story rightly turns on marriage and the conventions that could derail even a transcendent author. As Mrs. Austen reminds us, ""Affection is desirable. Money is absolutely indispensable!"" So Jane's life is determined by rigid class proprieties while her novels will force them to begin their downward slide for the next 200 years. Such is the irony of life."

Permalink",False,"Anne Hathaway is a great actress, but NOT Jane Austen, but that she convinces us that she is, is greatly to her credit. Her accent is generic modern upper class English. JA was educated, but rural, she would have had a 'local-yokel' accent. This is why Gweneth Paltrow does British so well. She is alert to the fact, that every 10 miles in the UK, the accent changes. In 1800, nobody spoke so 'nice'.

It is a great idea, well elaborated on with witty, and from the heart dialogue, the wit and relevance of the speeches are essential to the story of JA. The clothes are perfect, not too flashy, as becomes the daughter of a poor parson. But she would have been whiter, and ALWAYS worn a hat and gloves. The sets are also just right. The continuity of the seasons is lacking, winter and spring flash in and out of sequence. The acting cannot be faulted and all 3 gentlemen who play JA's admirers are outstanding in very different characters. The whole goes at a slightly uneven pace. But all in all, a really ENJOYABLE film. Non Jane Austen fans will enjoy it more than her fans, who will always be looking for 'hints' to stories she was to tell, and testing their vast knowledge of her life against the screenwriters.

Permalink",False,"I have to begin by saying that James McAvoy was mistakenly cast. He was supposed to be charming, handsome, a lady killer, a fighter, a lover. Indeed you cannot judge a book by it's cover, however you can certainly do so when someone tells you the book is green with yellow writing and what you see in front of you is a red book with purple writing ... You kind of notice that this isn't what it's supposed to be, right? So it is with McAvoy ...

As for Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Jane Austen I consider it to be tolerable, even surprising at times, however the accent was absolutely terrible ... why is it that it's so easy for the British to fake American accents (look at Hugh Laurie in House) and yet it's obviously an ordeal for Americans to fake a British accent? That kind of unsettled me, the part with the accent I mean. Other than that it was alright.

However, James McAvoy as the lead male character clearly drowns the more interesting parts of the movie ... No offense ...

Permalink",True,"What's the least productive way to waste your time if you like period movies? Watching a Jane Austen movie. What's the worst thing you can do next to going through an excruciating series of chores? Watching Becoming Jane. This movie reflects exactly why Austen became the overrated author she is, the reason why all of her characters seldom have any difficulty leading their prosperous lives. Being in financial difficulty, her family endeavors to convince her to marry a wealthy gentleman called Mr. Wisley, although she falls in love with Tom, a humble, yet honest lawyer with a bad reputation. Jane is stuck between choosing a perfect and rich life, and true love, the movie keeps swinging between the two relationships, but Jane follows her heart and grows fond of the poor lawyer who could be a perfect match for her, but at the end, she abruptly chooses the rich guy she NEVER gave a damn about, save for her financial troubles, in poor words, she ruins the message of the entire movie, and her life, by turning it from ""follow your heart"" to ""who cares about it, just get married with money"". Quite an unforgettable life lesson, right? I'm pointing my finger to the abundant English teachers who praise Austen as an author, and a human being. Austen taught girls that life should be weighed solely on money before Disney even taught them that the only for a girl way to change a man's life is by making use of their only available asset, their sexuality. Austen doesn't go against the flow, she pretends to, but at the end of the day embraces the social norms without providing any effort to display any agency whatsoever. She's clearly a mockery compared to female authors who truly contributed to FEMINISM like Charlotte Brontë, and doesn't deserve any respect. Austen is the mother of silly rom-coms, and that's all there's to it. Boring, dull, predictable rom-com plot. I still don't get why she's widely known in the world, despite being one of the worst authors I have ever read, and the worst female author for sure.

What an unusual concept: Make certain the actress playing a British woman can actually speak with a true British accent. Anna Maxwell Martin should also have been the choice as the real Jane was average looking - not drop dead gorgeous. What else can I say. Oh, yeah, The plot is completely inane and Jane's love interest (at least at the beginning, I didn't watch the film all the way through) is an irritating annoying little boy.

Permalink",False,"""Becoming Jane Austen"" was a sensational title when I first saw it, wondering how could a scenarist name such a mighty and impressive name-Jane Austen. Was he not afraid that he could have given readers over high expectations? Was he not scared the great novelist is easy to become a controversy issue? At first, I questioned. This is a story about the life of Jane Austen, depicting in a dramatic way. As a simple-mind girl lived in countryside of England without knowing outside world's affairs and writing was her only interest devoting wholeheartedly. Days passed by as common as water in rivers flew in the past twenty years. One day, a fashioned man, Tom Lefroy, came from London, all town admired this modern gentle man except Jane. Because when the first time they met, Lefroy criticized Jane's work, mocking that Jane was narrow-minded therefore she would have written such awful work. Jane was furious for saying so. After having several contact with Lefroy, Jane found they had fallen love with each other. They went away to London, overcame difficulties and almost got engaged, however, things went wrong. Jane went home alone, hearing Lefroy engaged to someone else, misunderstanding love didn't last and promising another engagement. In the shadow of the engagement, Jane wandered in the forest and Lefroy appeared. They decided to run away without anyone's agreement and get married. During the journey, Jane found that Lefroy had to raise his family and all the payment came from his uncle. In another word, if they got married, Lefroy's money would be cut off. Jane made up her mind and return to her hometown. After many decades, they met in a concert. Lefroy's daughter, also named Jane, asked Jane Austen to read the book for the public. Story ended with the plot of Pride and Prejudice. I think the story is familiar to Pride and Prejudice. Or maybe Jane had already wrote the story of herself. Ann Hathaway's acting was so fantastic and also did James Acvoy. They entirely expressed the feeling of hatred, love, pain and enduring. It is easy to give over high expectation to the so-called classic movie. But this one is a exception!"

I really don't like to compare actors/actresses to their previous films. I don't think it's fair, since movie themes come in a variety of genres.

I love Jane Austen, and I own every one of her books and even wrote a paper in my English class at college as one of my favorite authors. (her biography online is quite interesting) I dearly love films that take place between the early 300's a.d. to the late 1800's. I specifically enjoy movies whose subject matter takes place in the 1400's to the late 1700's because of the history, and the fashion of dress.

I feel Becoming Jane is an example of how life in that era was simple, laid back, and full of chivalry, honor, and relationship. Jane's novels reflect her views on the unbalanced practices in social classes.

I think her choice to live a single life was her ultimate statement and even political stance against a male dominated culture."

Permalink",True,"Stop with tales of Jane Austen already. They are constantly boring with everyone spewing forth his own philosophy.

Obviously, this definite period piece tries to overdo the mannerisms and tenets of a long bygone era. As the players say, they live in a period where it is believed that a wife who has a brain is dangerous.

James McAvoy, the lover of Austen, played well by Ann Hathaway, is too young for the part. He has that boyish look which seems inappropriate. It is only at the end of the film, when the years have passed, that he seems to come into his own.

As the erudite, manipulative and crusty old aunt, Maggie Smith gives a gem of a performance as this fine character actress always does.

Jane Austen never married. Let's keep it that way and not do anymore movies on a spinster who lived in a different era.

Permalink",True,"Another movie I missed in the theatre but caught up with  and thoroughly enjoyed - on a TransAtlantic flight. Becoming Jane is a pleasant, if not exactly groundbreaking movie, which explores the possibility that Jane Austen (and I have to put my cards on the table here and admit I'm a big Austen fan) took her artistic inspiration from a thwarted and doomed love affair in her youth. The best comparison I can give is with Shakespeare in Love.

Of course it is all wild speculation. Quite possibly Jane Austen was just an incredibly astute reader of other people's emotions and didn't necessarily need to have experienced a broken heart herself to be able to write about it. But she certainly understood the economic and social pressures of the time which often dictated people's choice of marriage partner. Love was an afterthought, and if you found it, you were lucky.

Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy give engaging performances, although I must admit I thought Ms Hathaway was perhaps a touch too beautiful for the role. However I can't fault her as an actress. I just have a feeling at the back of my mind (possibly quite unfounded) that had Jane Austen been as beautiful as Anne Hathaway, she would not have stayed unmarried, and, being saddled from then on by pregnancy and child-rearing, would probably not have given us those literary masterpieces.

James McAvoy seems to be in everything I watch at the moment, from Starter for Ten to Last King of Scotland to Atonement to ..and on and on. Some of those movies I've enjoyed more than others, although on the whole I have enjoyed McAvoy's performances in them. He seems to have come from nowhere, but looking on his IMDb profile I see that in fact he has been around for well over 10 years, working solidly. Much as I like him, I think he needs to avoid becoming over exposed too quickly, or we will tire of him. Anne Hathaway seems to be picking her roles carefully, and I think she too will be around for a long time.

Permalink",True,"I Love This Movie. I watched it so many times. I have told everybody about. Tom Mcfory is so cute and he is romantic and sweet and loving. I wish we had that type of men here. Gosh. I cant believe my eyes when i watched this movie. But the thing is i wish they ran away together and lived happily ever after. I thought that it was kind of creepy but sweet that he named her daughter after her. I couldn't believe the ending though, i was stunned at ever little thing. I wish they were together. I wish their ways, were our ways. AMazing movie, every one needs to watch this great movie. I am also reading the book of the movie. Anyway, great movie.

Permalink",False,"A fine movie which touches on the dilemmas of educated middle-class women between conventional marriage based on status and money concerns and the demands of love. This extremely common-place situation is portrayed in the context of the early life of a gifted individual- in the case of the movie that of Jane Austen who wrote about love and money and was very much appreciated by the English-speaking reading public.I do not know if the plot corresponds to the biographical details of Ms Austen's youth but it is a vivid visual description of the age and its' mores, life-styles and general ambiance. It is a very pleasant to watch movie and I think the actress that portrays Jane Austen has succeeded in capturing her witty and audacious personality which we suppose she had according to sources of the epoch and the flair of her novels.

Permalink",False,"In part due to the mediocre IMDb rating I had low expectations for this picture. I expected a movie picture fantasy about Jane Austen. What I got was an entertaining film that managed to be true to her work. The story has an actual historical basis and vividly depicts the harsh environment out of which Austen's work came. All of her fans, at least one time, when facing injustice, adversity, personal errors in judgment, or difficult decisions, have asked themselves what would Jane Austen have done? Her characters rely on reason and, well, character to get them through life's slings and arrows. Her work is keenly concerned with the consequences of actions. She counsels doing the right thing in spite of immediate adverse consequences because the alternatives lead to worse consequences. Austen instructs in the efficacy of grasping the nettle. All of this is captured in the film. I have a few quibbles, but given the film's accomplishment at getting Austen right, they are not worth mentioning.

Permalink",True,"Set in England around 1795, this film depicts a romance in the early life of Jane Austen. This particular summer romance may have been pivotal in Jane Austen's career as a novelist. The film is very well-done by the BBC and brings its characters and their times vibrantly to life on the screen. The plot moves forward at a nice pace. At no time did my interest sag. There are no car-chases, explosions, or special effects, so already it's way ahead of most of today's films. Of course, that also classifies BECOMING JANE as a Chick Flick. So, if you like romances -- and especially one based on historical fact -- I recommend you see BECOMING JANE.
