Permalink",True,"This is a movie that draws audiences through its great character portrayals that run the gamut from the joy of rediscovering love, to potential and actual tragedy and heartache, as well as anger.

However, some may find the pace a tad slow while Costner-bashers (and there are many) will remark that he has finally found a role that suits him. Not that he shines here but the character he plays is a reflection of his actual life - a has-been who has seen better days and is clinging on to fame and celebrity by the skin of his teeth.

Regardless of what you think or feel about Costner, it is shocking to see him deteriorate so much physically as the effect of middle age has fully come home to hit him in the gut (pun intended!).

Costner's ability to fit into a family initially thought to have lost its husband/father figure to a mid-age love affair to an ex-office staff, only for the shocking truth to be revealed later, lifts the movie.

The great interaction between four daughters and an angry wife with Costner's father/suitor role does not come across as sickeningly sweet and is handled deftly by the players and good direction as the plot unfolds.

If you can spare a couple of hours and want a quiet movie that does not shock with violence or ridicule with over the top humour, this may be just the one to while away a rainy day with. Not Kleenex box at hand material, but sufficiently absorbing and engaging enough.

Permalink",False,"I've always admired Kevin Costner's laconic screen presence, in BULL DURHAM, TIN CUP, even DANCES WITH WOLVES, JFK and PERFECT WORLD. Now no longer leading-man handsome, he's developed into a first- rate character actor, and as a washed-up, alcoholic ex-baseball player-turned radio talk-show host, Costner offers company and comfort to Joan Allen as a drinking buddy in the bittersweet THE UPSIDE OF ANGER. Mike Binder's superb film about an abandoned wife of four teenage girls should qualify as one of this year's best films. But because it was released so early, did only respectable business, and isn't a vehicle for an over-hyped box-office attraction on magazine covers now, it will probably only get the respect of word-of-mouth. I saw this engrossing, deeply wonderful film when it opened last winter, and made up my mind that I would have to have the DVD as soon as it became available.

Joan Allen, as Terry Wolfmeyer dazzles us in a performance that is both comically and dramatically masterful as the drunken mother seemingly at war with her four beautiful daughters. Terry's rage over her husband's abandonment of her and their children, is a mean-spirited rebuke to her daughters, who try with great patience to survive their mother's theatrical bitterness. But mama has given them the gift of her humor, and I think it's what saves these girls. There's a look that Joan Allen gives when one of her daughters is doing exactly what she doesn't want them to be doing. What it is they are doing to upset their mother is always in doubt because she's never really making rational sense. She's only filtering her displeasure through the rheumy eyes of her last cocktail. There's a scene at the family dining room where Hadley, her eldest daughter (the ever fascinating Alica Witt, who should be starring in her own movies), announces she's pregnant with her second baby. Allen was none-to-happy that her daughter opted for marriage and motherhood over a career, and her beady- eyed stare at her daughter's latest announcement of her grand-motherhood is a comic masterpiece. But when Allen finally can no longer avoid facing her crippling anger, Allen breaks your heart. Having never had an outlet for her comic abilities, she's surprises you with her skill. That she walks this fine tightrope between both extremes says much for her talent as an actor.

Finally back to Costner. Denny Davies might have been a dangerous character for Costner to revisit. Afterall, he's played washed up or played out sports characters before. His career has suffered a very precipitous fall following the media-created debacle of his so-called grandiose ego in WATERWORLD, and the opportunities have been few and far between since then. But Denny is a rich character any actor would love to sink their teeth into, and Costner embraces Denny's humanity with consummate ease. Discovering his neighbor has been abandoned by her husband, Denny offers to keep her company while they drink. They warily circle each other during these boozy afternoons of watching television, drinking and not saying much to each other. And when that changes, you see the transition from friend to lover mainly through the eyes of Denny. When she first proposes they sleep together, it's Denny who chickens out at the last minute. But as their relationship develops, you see Denny reach out to Terry's girls in a way that is sympathetic but also gives them room to accept and then love him in return. This is a terribly important test for Denny. So when the youngest of the girls finally asks him if he plans to marry Terry, Denny comes to understand that the girls have welcomed him into the family. Costner is sensational in this film, but he keeps it all so low-key, always keeping the focus on Allen's character, and he ends up giving her the film--and rightfully so, I think. This is a gift to Allen. Costner recognizes this, and I think the movie is all the better for his act of generosity. This is a performance that people will talk about for years to come. Like Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, Costner is one of our best screen actors, and it's great to see him in a role that is truly worthy of his fine talent.

Each of the daughter's is skillfully rendered by Erka Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russel and Alicia Witt. These young women look and act like siblings. Auteur Mike Binder has given himself a role as Denny's radio producer, who is romancing one of the daughters, much to her mother's disgust. He's funny, pathetic, and just a bit creepy as a Romeo with romantic ideas way above his station!

Binder's fine script gives this ensemble film the ballast that keeps you laughing and crying. He's found the emotional core in these character's lives, and the pace of the film, which clocks in at just under two hours, provides a sense of completeness.

Ultimately it is Costner's generosity as an actor that so disarms the viewer. In every shot, Joan Allen's Terry is the riveting center, with Costner playing to her every moment without stealing attention away from her. That earns my whole- hearted respect.

THE UPSIDE OF ANGER should be seen and savored by anyone who cares deeply about moves with something to say about the human condition. Binder's adroit direction makes this a film to set beside TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, and Lasse Hallstrom's vastly underrated SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. Finally it's such a pleasure to see two pros such as Allen and Costner hit it right out of the park!"

Permalink",False,"Life doesn't come with an instruction manual or a script to follow, it's basically improv on a daily basis, and as it plays out people and things often are not who or what they seem to be on the surface. It's reality, as opposed to the way you expect, hope or want it all to be; truth, as opposed to an individual perception of truth. That's life. And ""The Upside of Anger,"" written and directed by Mike Binder, explores some hard realities that differ drastically from expectations and perceptions.

The film opens with a funeral, a somber note which in a sense prepares you for what is to follow, after a flash back of three years, at which point the story begins. Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) is at loose ends because her husband has run off with his secretary, leaving her and four daughters behind to fend for themselves. Angry, distraught and a stone's throw from bitter, Terry turns to alcohol to deaden the effects of what has been a life-altering experience. Luckily-- or maybe not-- Terry has a neighbor, Denny Davies (Kevin Costner), an ex-pro baseball player turned radio talk show host, with whom to share a drink and commiserate. Her daughters (three teens and one in college) are supportive, as well-- to a point. But they are each in their own way also struggling to understand why their father deserted them. By all accounts, this was in no way a dysfunctional, angst-ridden family, so the actions of their father is a mystery to them all. Naturally, it's a pivotal point in their lives, and before any of them can move on, especially Terry, they have to know why he did what he did. In the meantime, with or without this needed closure, life is happening to and around them.

Binder (who also appears in the film as the producer of Denny's radio show) displays an astute knowledge of human nature with this film, and how random the myriad twists and turns of life can be. He holds your attention from the opening scene (who's funeral is it, anyway?), and just when you think you know where the story is going it takes an unexpected turn. And he is in no way attempting to manipulate his audience; rather, he is giving you a reflection of the way life so often simply does not go the way you think it's going to. It's a succinct look at relationships, and of how fragile-- as well as resilient-- we all can be.

As Terry, Joan Allen sets vanity aside to create her character and turns in an Oscar caliber performance in doing so. When she gets up in the morning she looks like a middle-aged woman with insufferable problems and a hangover, a woman in the throes of coping with a traumatic experience who is desperate to reconnect with a life she no longer has and who will do anything within her power to hang on to what she has left. She's walking a tightrope over a deep abyss and she's understandably on edge, so when one of her girls tugs the rope and compromises her control and security, she quite naturally lashes out, proving the old adage you always hurt the one you love. There's a scene in which a grieving Terry draws her hands to her breast and, head lowered, utters a cry, and anyone who has ever known any kind of grief or loss in their life will at that moment know exactly what she is going through. It's a terrific piece of acting, a performance that is altogether affecting and memorable.

And, as performances go, Kevin Costner, too, puts vanity aside to create a character that is entirely convincing. Denny Davies is paunchy, his hair is thin and most of the time he looks as though he's had one beer too many. Still, he's engaging, and you get the feeling there's a complex individual hiding behind an external simplicity that perhaps helps to mask his true feelings about a lot of things in his life, including his career on the diamond. Why, for example, does he refuse to talk about baseball on his sports talk show? In it's purity, this is arguably Costner's finest performance ever.

Top notch performances are turned in, as well, by Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt as Terry's daughters, respectively, Andy, Popeye, Emily and Hadley; and by Binder himself as Shep. In the end, ""The Upside of Anger"" is an involving, memorable film that celebrates life and leaves you with a sense of hope, that no matter how bad things get we all have the capacity to get through it and somehow find the light at the end of the tunnel. And that's the magic of the movies."

Permalink",False,"Among the many pleasures that ""The Upside of Anger"" offers, Joan Allen and Kevin Costner's performances are very much at the center of it. We are used by now at Joan Allen's marvelous gallery of characters. Here, she reaches very high, creating a character that moves through highs and lows with overwhelming power. It is a performance so entertaining, apart from everything else, that you are really compelled to go wherever she wants to take you. Kevin Costner, however, is the biggest surprise. I'm even tempted to call it a revelation. He carries the soul of the character in his sleeve with disarming charm and humanity, not a single false note. I believed him, I loved him, I want to see him again. Mike Binder, the gifted writer director of this film, unfortunately, outstretches himself a little bit. He gives too much room to his character and instead of allowing it to grow with the famous less is more formula, he concedes himself a couple of extra long and repetitive scenes that slow down the proceedings in a rather dangerous way. If I had been the producer I would have fought like crazy to eliminate the supermarket scene. But I'm not going to dwell on it. The film is a triumph for the two leads. Thank you Joan Allen and well done Kevin Costner. I'll see you again at Oscar time."

Permalink",False,"I saw this when it premiered at the Sundance film festival (although the director & actors didn't bother to come to our screening), and I enjoyed it. Kevin Costner plays a baseball player, but the movie is not about baseball; it deals with the anger the lead character feels when her husband disappears, along with his secretary. Joan Allen plays the wife of the missing man, and is the mother to four daughters, played very well by Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russel, Erika Christensen, and Alicia Witt. Joan Allen was marvelous. We laughed many times when she glared in anger at different characters in the movie (and we were glad she wasn't mad at US! LOL...) I have not been a big fan of Kevin Costner in recent years, but thought that he did a great job as the man who helps Joan Allen's character pick up the pieces. The writer/director also has a role in the film as an older man who dates Joan Allen's daughter. I thought the message of the film was delivered well, and it was an entertaining story. There is a twist at the end that I truly did not see coming. I don't think it spoiled the movie, it was just unexpected.

Permalink",False,"""The Upside of Anger"" showcases many good performances but make no mistake about it, this movie's clearly the Joan Allen Show. And what a show she puts on.

About an hour into the film, Allen's Terry Wolfmeyer bursts into a room unannounced. Her reaction lasts just a few seconds, but they're priceless. Writer-director Mike Binder keeps the camera on Allen and what we get is a moment of sheer brilliance, one that should be shown to all acting students.

Binder does something awfully bold in this film. He lets his story revolve around two seemingly unlikable people - Terry and her neighbor, Danny Davies (Kevin Costner). They're two self-destructive, terribly selfish, occasionally boorish people who wallow in their own pity. Terry's furious and hurt because her husband left her for his Swedish secretary, while Danny's a former Detroit Tiger who now spends signing baseball memorabilia and running a radio talk show where he refuses to talk baseball.

They find solace in each other, not because they particularly like each other, but because they each need a drinking buddy. But thanks to two very fine performances, they're likable.

Much to Binder's credit, he doesn't simply settle his story on Terry and Danny. Wisely, Binder lets his story take its time. We get to know Terry's children, too. There's Andy (Erika Christensen), who's dating an older lech Shep (Binder); Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood), the youngest and budding filmmaker; Emily (Keri Russell), who feels unloved; and rebellious Hadley (Alicia Witt). These young women have their own personalities and spending time with them makes the story richer.

Costner is awfully comfortable playing Danny. In fact, Danny is Crash Davis, slightly older and a bit more cynical. Danny doesn't like clinging to his baseball past, but he knows that's all he's got. It's nice to see Costner in these roles. He plays them better than most and it's a loose, relaxed performance that never goes over the top.

But the movie really is all about Allen. It's tough turning a self-destructive and pitiful alcoholic into someone we want to spend time with. But Allen simply sparkles in the role. She's smart, quick-witted and fraying at the edges, trying to keep her wits about her. We not only understand her roller-coaster emotions, but also find them believable. Performances like hers are truly rare and Allen does nothing wrong here.

Had this film been released last year, Hilary Swank might very well not have walked away with her second Academy Award. Not only does Allen deserve a nomination for her remarkable performance in this film, she also probably deserves to win it.

What surprising about Binder's story is that despite all its warmth and humor, there's still a very nice and unexpectedly dark edge to it all. It's refreshing to see a film where the characters and the situations aren't exactly all that rosy. And even moments that could have easily been played for their melodrama are brilliantly underplayed and toned down. They work much better this way, than having characters resort to histrionics.

The film's voice-over narration, on the other hand, gets a bit preachy. And a revelation at the end is a bit questionable. Astute viewers would figure it out because that's really the only rational way to deal with it. Binder sort of lets us in on it very early on in the film.

We never get to see the title's real meaning in this film. That, presumably, comes after the end credits and all these characters get on with their lives. Nevertheless, ""The Upside of Anger"" is a good film studded with a great performance by one of today's finest actresses."

Permalink",False,"The Upside of Anger was a wonderfully written script. The perfect blend of humor and sadness, consistent in real life. Each character was developed uniquely, with many different layers. Each character was matched by strong up and coming and veteran actors. Joan Allen as usual is a gem and proves that mainstream Hollywood is missing one of the great female leads of our time. Kevin Costner sticks out and steals the show. He's quirky but real and perfectly lovable. All the girls, although they did not get enough screen time, were capable, exceptional, actors with a bright future in front of them all. Especially the youngest daughter played by Evan Rachel Wood. This is a rare comedy that must be seen. Although the average American may find it slow with it's absence of car chases and sword fights, one can only hope that this movie will find it's audience and grow enough to fall into the laps of the average and broaden their minds.

Permalink",True,"SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE.

I can't understand anyone loving this movie. I can't understand the high rating it received.

Her husband is gone, and the wife assumed he left her without saying a word. What about his car, or his usual means to get to work? What about his office? What about him not packing a suitcase, or taking a thing? She should have called the police to report his disappearance, in case he was somewhere injured -- which he was! Even if he wanted to hurt his wife in the worse way, there was no indication that he wanted to hurt his daughters that way.

I hope the wife threw up because she realized what an idiot she'd been to assume he'd left her. I hope she's haunted by the idea that he might not have died instantly, that if she had called the police, and if they had investigated, he might have been found sooner, perhaps even alive. Even if he hadn't lived, maybe he could have said goodbye to his daughters.

If I were the DA, I'd charge that idiot wife with something!

Permalink",True,"Mike Binder both wrote and directed this searingly important film; important for its concept, for its ensemble acting, and for performances by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner that are now the gold standard for the year by which all other award quality performances must be judged.

Anger, and how it paralyzes our emotional outlook and alters our perception of reality and works to destroy those around us, is the harsh subject of this examination of a well-to-do family of husband, wife and four teenage daughters. The story is narrated by the youngest daughter Lavender 'Popeye' Wolfmeyer (Evan Rachel Wood) and never were the words 'out of the mouth of babes' so pertinent. The mother Terry (Joan Allen) is introduced drunk, constantly in her nightgown with glass of vodka in hand, and she pretty has spent her days in that manner since her husband Grey 'left her with his 22-year-old Swedish office girl' without a note, a call, or confrontation with his family. Terry is consumed with anger, self pity, loathing, and barely manages to maintain a household, completely relying on her four daughters to cook, clean, shop, etc while she finds reasons to berate them for every act and motivation the girls show. Hadley (Alicia Witt) is the oldest and enamored with a boy Terry considers a waste of time. Andy (Erica Christensen) doesn't want to go to college but to become a reporter instead - a fact Terry refuses to consider. Emily (Keri Russell) prefers to follow her dream of becoming a ballet dancer and attending an Arts College that, of course, Terry refuses to allow. Popeye, the youngest, is hungry for belonging and wants desperately to be noticed by not only her mother but by boys, etc.

A neighbor Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) is an alcoholic ex-baseball hero who now has a cheesy but popular radio talk show produced by his buddy Shep (Mike Binder, yes, the writer/director!). Denny has been friends of the Wolfmeyers for years and shows up drunk, warmly offering himself as a drinking partner to Terry. The two spend their time drinking and watching television and watching the daughters each arrive at crises: Hadley gets pregnant and announces her engagement to Terry after everyone else knows: rage from Terry and an embarrassing scene at Hadley's announcement dinner. Andy gets a job at Denny's radio show only to fall into bed with the lothario Shep: rage and a public fight from Terry. Emily somaticizes her career frustration and ends up in a hospital with an ulcer: self-pity and depression from Terry. Denny slowly works his way into Terry's bed and become a surrogate father/lover to these five father/husband-deserted women. The ending is a shocker and cannot be revealed because it would destroy the fine story line of the film. But it begins as it ends and that is the part that leaves the audience aghast that they didn't suspect that turn of event.

Binder's script and direction achieve the impossible: he is able to create a family in disarray, deal with every aspect of anger, desertion, family ties, mother/daughter love (though severely tested), the needs of the 'victim' and how they can be tended. Amazingly he does this with a large does of comedy, acerbic dialogue, restrained responses, and a keen grasp of reality that makes this a film about a tough subject one that is engrossing and never off-putting.

The entire cast is pitch perfect: each of the actors who portray the daughters is exceptional. But the brilliance that radiates from the screen is the triumphant performance by Joan Allen. She inhabits Terry and despite the fact that she has every reason to make us loathe her character, she manages to keep her portrayal so sensitively nuanced that we stay close to her in this journey. She is simply amazing in her body language, her understanding of alcoholic behavior patterns, and her internalization of her needs at the expense of her ever-surfacing rage. Much the same can be said for Kevin Costner who gives the finest performance of his career in a role that could be pathetic and negative in the hands of a less capable actor. His comedic talents shine, but not at the expense of his enormous sensitivity to the five women with whom he ends up living.

Alexandre Desplat has once again created a movie score that has perfectly beautiful passages of music while always underlining the story appropriately. The cinematography by Richard Greatrex finds the perfect vantages that seem like windows in the hearts of each of the participants in the story. Highly Recommended.

Permalink",False,"Once every so often a movie comes along that hits all the right notes with its audience. It has just the right amount of each element that makes a great film and then kicks it up a notch with more.

Mike Binder has done all this with his new film, The Upside of Anger. Upside of Anger opens at a scene from the end of a movie; a scene that stays in the audience's mind, making us trying to guess its cause all the way through the movie. We meet Terry Wolfmeyer, a middle aged woman with four daughters who is trying to keep their and her own life in balance. Terry's husband has just recently left the family causing Terry to spiral into alcohol and bitterness. Along comes Denny Davies, an ex-baseball player, current radio show host, and Terry's neighbor. He too, is a fan of the drink, and strikes a friendship with Terry along with a fatherly role for her daughters. At its root, it's Terry's story about how she deals with the continuous growing of her relationships, of her daughters, and of herself.

Mike Binder, the writer and director, has a great way of showing the lives of all his characters. He is able to make this movie just as life really is; its funny, depressing, uplifting, bittersweet, and sometimes tragic. He seems to be able to capture real life on camera and display it with all its truth and realism. The writing is completely intelligent, hilarious writing is mixed with scenes of great emotion. Binder never relies on action or dialogue that will cue laughter or tears; it comes naturally through the writing. It works differently for every person in the audience.

Joan Allen is fabulous as the angry mother, Terry. Her performance contains each the real emotion of a mother with all that she is dealing with. She plays it with vigor that strikes that fear in us that we all know mothers can emit, but we also see her lighter funny side. Kevin Costner does very well as Denny, who, surprise surprise, is a baseball player. His performance is hilarious as the washed up player who beams an empathetic hippie attitude. Costner, in his first good and well-written role in a while, is a relief to have. Also hilarious is Director, Mike Bender's Shep, Denny's radio show producer. The four daughters also add four different personalities to the family that interact very nicely.

The Upside of Anger is a wonderfully acted movie, and what's more, it is superbly written. It captures a true essence of family life. And, while its hilarious, it's a refreshing kind of humor that is very mature and not based on the stupidity that many people think we want to see. Mike Binder is successful at making a movie about the characters and about life that actually does a good job at representing both things. Upside of Anger gets 5 stars (out of 5)"

Permalink",False,"After her performance in ""The Ice Storm"" it is no surprise that Joan Allen could carry a movie like ""The Upside of Anger"". Nor was it a surprise that she and Alicia Witt could beautifully play off each other in their confrontational mother and daughter roles. What did surprise was that the film featured equally strong performances from the other members of the cast. Even writer/director Mike Binder does a fine ""on-screen"" job as a slimy but not entirely unsympathetic radio producer. Kevin Costner would be wise to stay with this type of role (and with comedy) instead of big-budget epic stuff.

The casting of Witt with Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, and Keri Russell as the four sisters was inspired. It was refreshing just to see a film family that looked enough alike physically to actually be related to each other. Since Christensen looks so much like Julia Stiles they could have even added a fifth sister although their resemblance is so strong that it might be confusing. All the subtle birth order distinctions felt right. The oldest (Witt) was the most connected to mom even though it did not appear so on the surface. The second (Christensen-who absolutely glows on the screen) was determined to be different than her older sister. The third (Russell) was the most connected to the father, missed him the most, and had the least understanding of the mother. The youngest (Wood) was way ahead of the curve and the most perceptive character in the film. Watch for all this stuff because it is there, and watch how no matter how down the mother becomes she continues to monitor the welfare of her daughters.

Binder gave into the temptation to use cheesy special effect gimmicks several times (the explosion at the dinner table, the neighborhood transition from summer to winter, the ballet fantasy, and the daughters growing older during the funeral scene). Although done well they seemed out of place. Also Binder should review the Kent State shootings, there were four students killed-not six.

There is a spectacular shot at the wedding. Beginning as an over the shoulder shot of Hadley (Witt) sucking in her ""plump"" cheeks, the camera pans slightly right and moves toward the wedding party as the focus changes to bring them out of a blur.

The film's ironic twist in the last 15 minutes is borrowed wholesale from ""Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice"". I particularly liked Wood's beautiful narration which helped clarify the title and theme, necessary (or at least helpful) after this ironic story line twist. She managed to sound both detached and involved, it is actually the voice-over for her broadcasting class project. When we are suddenly forced to reevaluate everything that has gone before in what we thought was just an interesting comedy, Wood steps in and steers us to internalize the theme. They go out on a shot of Wood looking up from her Mac and smiling. Amazing.

This is the best of Binder's writing: ""Anger and resentment can stop you in your tracks. That's what I know now. It needs nothing to burn but the air and the life that it swallows and smothers. It's real though, the fury, even when it isn't. It can change you, turn you, mold you and shape you into something you're not. The only upside of anger then, is the person you become, hopefully someone that wakes up one day and realizes they're not afraid of its journey. Someone that knows that the truth is, at best, a partially told story. That anger, like growth, comes in spurts and fits and in its wake leaves a new chance of acceptance and the promise of calm"".

""The Upside of Anger"" is one of those rare films that I believe everyone should make an effort to connect with, doing so will make you a better person. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

Permalink",True,"Sort of a Role-of-a-Lifetime thing for Joan Allen, who, after having spent years in the supporting-role trenches, probably deserves it. So, the inevitable question: is the movie built around her worth watching?

Eh, not really. But before I move on to the movie's structural faults, it's worth considering that another of the movie's faults just might be Allen's scene-stealing, scenery-chewing performance. Perhaps ill-advisedly encouraged by writer-director Mike Binder, Allen -- the actress -- behaves just as ungenerously to her fellow actors as the matriarch behaves towards her fictional daughters and other satellites like Kevin Costner's easy-going codependent neighbor. This is a shame, because the supporting cast (Evan Rachel Wood, Erika Christensen, Alicia Witt, and Keri Russell as the daughters, along with Costner and Binder) are quite charming and good in the film: they deserve better than to primarily exist as scratching-posts for the matriarch's petulance. Allen's character, while successfully conveying the distracted apportionment of care-giving and overall rearing to each of her kids (each of whom are pretty individualized, within the script's cramped parameters), is on the other hand too domineering to make us really like her. (Evan Rachel Wood continually narrates that her mother used to be a sweet-tempered person, but any evidence of sweetness left over from the past 50-odd years is lacking.) And LIKING her, it seems to me, would be a prerequisite in a movie like this, which, after all is said and done, is little more than an upscale *Lifetime* movie with a sprinkle of Woody-Allenian angst over it. Otherwise, we'll feel too encouraged to cheer when Costner breaks down her bathroom door after enduring one of her typical lacerating monologues. We'll perhaps feel a little too triumphant when Binder's character -- a sleazy radio talk-show producer egregiously dating one of Allen's daughters -- lays out to her in no uncertain terms why he's bedding the kid instead of her. (Allen, defeated, skulks over to the bar and falls off the wagon.)

But, after all, *The Upside of Anger* comes from the mind of *The Mind of the Married Man*, the aborted HBO comedy show that has become almost legendary for the misogyny cloaked under its middle-brow sophistication. Misogyny and middle-brow sophistication are certainly among THIS movie's problems. Binder's final insight seems to be: menopausal women can be grouchy! -- but they might get over it after awhile, as long as there's a non-threatening doofus (e.g., Costner's former jock) around who understands which one of them is wearing the proverbial pants. I suspect men will like this movie far more than they'll admit to, as it confirms their own opinions about uppity middle-aged rich broads. Imagine dating columnist Maureen Dowd! -- every man's worst nightmare. Clever women will probably glean what Binder's up to and therefore will not be fooled.

A final thought: Binder clearly doesn't know anything about the milieu of which he writes. You'll note that Allen has no lady-friends in the film: there are no socials at the country club; no Friends-of-the-Library gatherings; no slightly-Left-of-Center political Meetups. She's utterly without society, apart from her daughters and newfound drinking buddy Costner. This is all rather unlikely for a suburban duchess living in the genteel outskirts of Old Money Detroit. Even more unlikely, of course, is her nervous breakdown upon discovering that her husband has dumped her for his Swedish secretary. Quite apart from the knowledge that any divorce proceedings would be a slam-dunk in her favor, her new liberation would be far more joyful than Binder's ""married mind"" suspects. (Or fears.) In other words, it's not entirely clear what the hell this woman is so angry about: gorgeous house; four beautiful daughters; obliging hunk; lots of money. Given the current circumstances of the world, the problems presented here amount to a really small hill of beans.

The only likable character might be the radio DJ Art. Kevin Costner is running on fumes. Joan Allen is good, but you can only act like that for so long in the movie.

Mike Binder should have stuck to a couple of characters to work with instead of trying to squeeze something out of everyone of them. Better luck next time.

Permalink",True,"I adore Joan Allen, and was rooting for her. However, watching her, I'm reminded of a one-line review of Robert DeNiro in 'New York, New York' : ""DeNiro plays a saxophonist like a clenched fist.""

Inciting incident: offscreen, a husband allegedly runs off with his Swedish secretary - to Sweden, of all places.

Angry, hard-drinking wife cancels the credit cards. That'll show him.. If he was dead, then there'd be no husband-related balance changes to their bank accounts. The very dullest of intellects might notice the lack of withdrawals.

If he was dead, then where's the alleged Swedish secretary? Why didn't she come around? Why is there no missing-persons search? And where'd the rumor that they ran off to Sweden come from?

Terry says that she heard that her husband ""wasn't talking about it to his co-workers"": if he wasn't at the office, he couldn't talk about it, true, but the tiny point that he wasn't at the office at ALL didn't seem to make it through.

Kostner lets himself be filmed with unflattering stubble and body fat, gets to act slightly drunk most of the time, and looks like he enjoyed himself thoroughly. Although why he's attracted to Allen's spiky, completely unlikeable Terry character is utterly unexplained.

The four daughters were definitely all photogenic and each has fragmentary subplots.

Number One, the eldest, is preggers on graduation day and gives Mom the news that she's getting married. Exit stage left. We only see her again at the end, pregnant again. No babies in evidence.

Number Two is a wannabe dancer with stomach-aches and lots of conflict with Mom, which lands her in hospital, life in danger, oops, it's 'only' stress related, let's go to the ballet where Mom Will See It My Way And Let Me Live My Dream.

Number Three Doesn't Want To Go To University (way to rebel!) and instead gets involved with a sleazy radio producer, Denny's old friend.

Number Four, the youngest, tries repeatedly to seduce a moronic kid whose only topic of converse is bungee jumping, and it turns out he doesn't even do that, like Peter Sellers, he likes to watch. Oh, and he's gay.

Number Four daughter also carries the heavy-handed task of providing subtext, in the form of a stupid computer video (""..a CLASS assignment, Mother"") about conflict and warfare between the sexes, which gives us too-often-repeated visuals of people hitting each other from old silent films, and gives her all too many opportunities for portentous voice-over crimes against this already crippled film.

Director/writer Mike Binder writes himself a role where he gets to entice Terry's juiciest daughter with a dream job, and then becomes her lover. He's the only one that ever tells Terry how hateful she is, getting slapped for his trouble. Kostner's Denny character, knowing full well what a sleazebag Binder's character is, goes ahead and gets Binder and Daughter Number Three together anyway. Sorry, aging male fantasy time.

The big revelation near the end of this film was a complete bust. The fiction was that Terry's husband had run off with his secretary and had no contact whatsoever.

But hey! He's been dead in a hole all this time!

For a few minutes after the big discovery-in-the-woods, I thought it was possible that Terry had killed him and hidden his body in the 80 acre wood behind their house.. now, THAT would have been a reversal worth waiting for, and would have explained Terry's total lack of interest in her departed husband's whereabouts. But it would've undercut the purported reason for all that vitriol.. but we could've re-understood it as guilt and anger at herself.. ah, the wasted opportunities.

But no, we get a long-delayed funeral, where Denny's finally wormed his way into the family. And of course the big, heavy-handed irony is that Terry's three years of good anger was wasted.. Oh, All The Damage She's Wrought.

Permalink",True,"Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!

You call this anger??? You call this Transformation??? Anger is paying 8 bucks to see a film about the transformative power of anger and sitting for two hours watching Joan Allen give a stupefying performance as a boring, self-indulgent housewife. What an utterly pedestrian take on anger!

First, as far as anger goes, Terry seemed angry in a way only identifiable to a very sheltered WASPy class of people. I did not come away from this film understanding anything more about WASPy anger, or the social pressures of conformity felt by upper class women, or the challenges faced by women sheltered by marriage. What I did understand was that it's apparently quite easy to shock and offend people in Bloomfield simply by being snappish and socially inappropriate. Wow, how outrageous! Oh, that crazy, angry Terry Wolfmeyer! How absurd!

Secondly, the film's fatal mistake was opening *after* the Wolfmeyer's marriage had apparently dissolved and Terry was already angry--or grouchy, as the case may be. Terry's transformation through anger--the entire premise of the film--was left entirely to the pithy narration of the daughter: ""My Mom had always been the nicest person, really."" Really??? How so??? How did she change??? How was she different by the end of the film??? Give me something to go on!! Narration is not a substitute for plot--it's a weak cop-out. Just tell the audience the story instead of actually developing a script that demonstrates it.

Thirdly, I have to take issue with the way in which Shep--the only really noble, honest character in this film--was shabbily dismissed. Denny, who had hooked up with his friend's wife *a week* after the marriage broke up, physically attacked his friend Shep for making the most ambiguous possible pass at Terry weeks after she and Denny had split. What a hypocritical plot device! Shep was raked over the coals throughout the film for being an older (and unattractive) man who liked young women--Ohhh, how disgusting! How vile! What a bad, bad man! Bad to whom??? Shep was honest about who he was and what motivated him and he didn't care what people thought about him. And, he was the only character in this film who consistently stood up to Terry's whiny, childish behavior. He should have slapped her! She deserved it!

I supposed by the end of the film, the audience was supposed to share Denny's righteous anger--but truthfully, Denny just came off as a possessive, hypocritical lout. I thought liking Kevin Costner's character in a film was too good to be true--and I was right.

Basically, this film seems to have been made exclusively for an audience of highly repressed, self-involved, suburban middle aged women. There was a really annoying *wink and a nod* quality to the dilemmas faced by Terry--something I felt completely alienated by.

The only ""Upside"" of this film is the fact that it'll make a great contribution to the Lifetime network's menu of pithy, suburban drama. But I'll take real anger, thank you very much.

Permalink",True,"This is quite possibly the worst movie of the last decade. Six hateful, spiteful characters with nothing to teach us, no wisdom to share, no insights to illuminate. Just vitriol and anger.

Do we really need to see 130 minutes of Joan Allen snipping at everyone that gets in the way of her ""broodfest""? Don't we get that she's bitter and resentful after the first few scenes? Don't we understand the level of her bitchiness is deep, and the repercussions for trying to bring her out of her dark place are severe? So what if her husband left her for a Sweedish dish, why do I care? I never cared. Quite frankly, I would have left her for an ugly Romanian char-woman.

I've never seen a story filled with more rudderless losers. I think you could go to an AA meeting and have more fun. Hell, a funeral would be a comparative hoot.

What's worse, however, is that this movie tries to pass itself off as some sort of social commentary on the human condition. It thinks it knows something, or has something to say. Unless that message is: ""people are bitter, angry people, that suck, and when bad things happen to them they suck even more, and can't pull themselves out of a death spiral even after three long, boring years of drinking and hatred"" then fine, I guess it has a message.

Worse still, is that a lot of people are buying it. (Look at some of the comments on this site.) So let me help you... it's crap. Don't pretend it's something that it's not. Dark films with points have their place, but this isn't one of them. This is a dark, POINTLESS, film. ""Full of sound and fury..."" and all that.

The characters, too, don't have any pearls of wisdom to offer us. They walk around, drunk, high, or stupid the entire time. They don't even have reasons for doing what they do- they, all of a sudden, just do things. For example, when Joan's character gives up drinking (for a brief moment). Why? No explanation. Or when Costner's character confronts writer, actor, doofus radio producer, Shep, about sleeping with Allen's daughter and says ""I should have stopped you earlier."" (Oh, wow, how powerful.) Yeah, but that would have made you interesting. And who would have wanted that?

But, don't despair, all is not lost. Some fun can be had if you are drugged and forced to go see this... abomination. You can try to spot the hundreds of continuity problems. Here are a few to get you started: a dog that appears out of nowhere, a bedroom that gets a makeover halfway through, characters that appear and then disappear for no reason, seasons that change on a schedule unfamiliar with the pattern established over the last hundred million years or so... and, my favorite, a man who can fall into a hole, die, and while dead, cover himself up with boards. Nice.

The bottom line: if you waste your money on this film, there will be one more angry person out there and there is no upside to that.

Permalink",True,"I can't believe this movie was actually enjoyed by other viewers.

There were so many holes within the story.

The film begs us to have the impression that before her husband disappears we are to believe that she is an outstanding mother...yet we are not given any clues to that. She does a lot of yelling at her daughters and using alcohol as crutches for the grief she is feeling.

The mother has several exchanges of dialogue with eldest, second, and third daughters...but did mother and youngest daughter ever have a conversation?

The scenes that show relationships between mother and daughter are weak and unfulfilled. There are some moments that stand out...typically the ones with Kerri Russell.

The relationship with Denny seems awkward. And how is it that he can enter into her bathroom after a few scenes. And she does not throw him out? That is forced and unrealistic.

The following scenes are gratuitous:

when we see Sheps head explode at the dinner table (that affect was lost on me- I can understand her anger- it is built up esp. from the slurping- but really....couldn't the money spent on that have been put to better use?

The scene with Shep and Terry in the grocery store...I understand it was used to re-introduce Denny back into Terry's life...but I think it was another waste of time.

At the BBQ- we learn of another baby to be born to Hadley....where is the first one? We never see or hear about the birth!--Weird....

I think that more could have been done with the scene where husbands body is found. And here is the only time I thought- Well here we have a story.....but it was left flat and not developed more....that was a disappointment.

All in all, I would not recommend this movie to another viewer.

I have enjoyed the actors work in other projects, and I enjoy their efforts in Upside of Anger, I think it is a shame that there wasn't more to the script and/or direction that could have made this film better.

Permalink",False,"The upside of Anger is a movie with a lot to say about many things, in addition to anger. So many movies today have nothing to say...and become so easy to forget. This one was memorable. The movie spoke of relationships, emotion, perseverance, humor, tolerance, and of course anger. This movie was a near masterpiece, really. The performances were terrific by all the females, especially Joan Allen. The script was terrific and the directing was top notch too. Kudos to Mike Binder!!

All people have shitty things happen to them...that's a fact. The lesson in the movie is that the important thing is, how do we deal with those shitty things. We can choose alcohol, we can choose anger, we can choose to hurt those we love. But eventually, we will chose happiness, despite all the mayhem life throws our way. Happiness is a relative term. I loved the fact that there were many things about Terry (Joan Allen) that I didn't like, yet, I still liked her enough to be sympathetic towards her. I don't cry that easily during movies, but this one brought the Kleenex out, twice. I am a guy and I am aware that tears are very therapeutic. A good cry is awesome..if it's real. Many things have been said about the ending, but watch it for yourself. I have no problems at all with the ending. See this movie, I dare you not to like it."

Permalink",True,"If you are a man and were not offended by this movie you are probably gay.

Everything wrong with women's attitudes towards father's and men are showcased in the two hours this movie plays. Let me explain.

Husband of 30 years goes missing. Wife assumes he's a cad. Doesn't report him missing. Doesn't call police. Doesn't even call his office. Has an affair with the next door neighbor. Poisons his children into believing her horribly wrong assumption. Destroys his reputation by telling everyone she knows what she wants people to believe he did to her.

She is so self-centered she doesn't even know if her husband exists. She slaps her daughters boyfriend because her trust issues run so deep she has uncontrolled violence towards men. The man didn't strike back, which was a joke.

The romance with the neighbor is a joke. The woman is so vile, no self-respecting man would go near her. She offers absolutely nothing. She disrespects every male within hearing distant.

She is a contradiction. She wants her children to go to college but doesn't bother asking them. She is so self-centered, she couldn't possibly care about her children.

The worst moment in the film was when she lead her children to announce they hate their father. And worse yet, the kids (all girls) readily accepts this garbage. I guess father's rank right up there with dog poo.

The second worst moment in the film was after the funeral the witch and her brood are sitting at a picnic table with the witch's boyfriend, and they start laughing and smiling all gay and happy, confirming the father was indeed dog poo. Yes folks. Not a tear in site for dear old dad, who died and was forgotten quicker than they could get our of the funeral attire.

The men are dog poo, the women are self-centered, self-righteous, witches, and the children are dumb as logs.

So if that sounds interesting to you, then watch the movie. It pretty much ruined my day and makes me wonder if my wife and children actually care about me. Jaws was much better. At least all I have to do to avoid getting eaten is stay out of the water. How do I avoid gender discrimination and bias?

Permalink",False,"""The Upside of Anger"" is a crass imitation of ""heart warming family drama."" There are a couple of lines of dialogue that ring true, and a couple of scenes that work really well, but the true moments are awash in a movie so crass, exploitative, and phony it made me cringe.

Mike Binder, the filmmaker, earned a lot of brownie points for making a movie about a woman over forty, starring an actress over forty: Joan Allen.

But Binder is sure to surround Allen with a bevy of young beauties. Somehow this woman had four daughters who always look like they are posing for the cover of ""Seventeen"" magazine. Every one -- one a blonde, one a brunette, one a redhead -- is, in every scene, provocatively dressed, perfectly coiffed, and without a single zit. Tell me, in how many families with that many teenagers can you find not a single pimple or kid who's too skinny or too fat, or too shy or too loud, or who moves awkwardly? Feh.

Joan Allen bears about as much relation to a real woman over forty as Mickey bears to a real mouse. She drinks alcoholically, and yet never has puffy eyes or sallow skin. After relying on alcohol for months, she just, one day, quits, with no addictive kickback. I don't think so.

Oh, and the day her husband disappears, an incredibly attractive man -- Kevin Costner! -- throws himself at her. Oh, yeah, this happens to every newly single woman over forty with four kids. In Fantasyland! And, after her husband disappears, she never does a thing to attempt to contact him, but, somehow, his money continues to support her lifestyle, which is just a bit short of a Donald Trump style life. Where is all that cash coming from? Sure, this is a movie, and movies aren't supposed to be real. But this movie advertises itself as a film that takes on tough problems. There should be a word for this -- advertising your film as a film that addresses alcohol abuse, the loneliness of an abandoned, older mother, suddenly finding oneself single -- and then lies about every one of those important issues.

there are a couple of good scenes that just make everything around them look more like drek. An older, nebbishy character (Mike Binder, the filmmaker, also plays a small part in the movie), tells Joan Allen exactly why he chases younger women. His point is a valid one, and that scene deserves to be in a better movie.

Throughout the movie, Joan Allen plays a self absorbed ice shrew who deals with life and loved ones by pouring herself a stiff drink, sitting around in her negligee, and refusing to speak, while shooting death rays with her eyes. This is never believable, because we all know and love Joan Allen, and she's the star of the movie, so we keep waiting for her to show what a great gal she really is at heart.

Kevin Costner, though, reaches a point where he won't put up with this any more, and he emphatically tells her, ""I'm tired of being your bitch."" This is an electric scene, and it very much deserves to be in a much better, braver, grittier, funnier, tougher movie.

Finally, the last act offers a surprise ending that makes everything that came before it cheaper and utterly unbelievable.

Given the great cast here, and the good intentions, somewhere, in here, there is a good movie dying to get out. Sadly, it never quite does.

You almost want the cast to reassemble at some point in the future, and try again."

Permalink",False,"THE UPSIDE OF ANGER

""Classic melodrama"" was the old-fashioned term used to characterize family dramas where women struggled with their situation or gave voice to once- repressed desires. More often than not, these films focused on the bourgeoisie, where stifling urges and desires for fulfillment is endemic. Galvanized by a great and witty script, and powered by truly remarkable performances by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner, Upside of Anger is a welcome and inspired revision of the classic genre. Writer/director Mike Binder deserves all the kudos he will likely receive for this superbly rendered comedic drama, which is at once traditional and iconoclastic and as absorbing and entertaining as it is appealingly human.

The story is set in motion when the alcoholic matriarch of the well-to-do midwestern Wolfmeyer family discovers her husband has disappeared and left her to raise four headstrong daughters (all in various stages of young adulthood) on her own, without any clear means of support. Her drunken rants fuel her already combative parenting style, and the situation really erupts when a middle-aged neighbor makes a play for her attention. The stellar cast, including Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell, and Alicia Witt, makes this portrayal of a family's emotional transformation one of the most pleasurable and surprisingly unpredictable romantic dramas you'll see this year. Geoffrey Gilmore

Permalink",False,"Terry Wolfmeyer (Allen), wife and mother of 4 daughters, has to face the life after her husband suddenly disappears, apparently with his secretary, to Sweden. Left alone to raise her daughters, she quickly discovers the comfort of Gin & Tonic, in company of her next-door neighbour Danny (Costner), a once-great baseball star turn radio DJ. The drinking buddies slowly evolve into a relationship, becoming her source of strength in overcoming her husband's defection and concentrating on her daughters again.

While the performance of Costner and Allen are pretty convincing, the story fails to deliver at many points and we are left wondering why we should care. Rich people with rich people's problems. Both Terry and Danny are way too financial secure to convincingly convey any empathy and the most interesting and likable characters, the daughters, don't have the opportunity to fully develop. Even the surprising twist-ending ultimately fails to deliver.

In short it's an absolutely forgettable movie, a lost opportunity. The only highlight is Kevin Costner who has never been so good at being so ordinary."

Permalink",False,"I never would have believed Joan Allen could give a bad performance...until I watched ""The Upside of Anger."" The main culprit was not Joan but the horrendous dialogue she had to work with in this wretched film.

What a shame since the cast was excellent! At some point the writer Binder should have decided whether this film was to be a comedy or a drama. As it turned out, there was no grounding in reality and no credibility in the scenes, situations, and dramatic moments. All of the actors drifted through this film on auto-pilot because of the incoherent screenplay.

In the main family, there were four sensitive, well-mannered, and mature daughters and a mother who could well be classified as insane by any standards. It made no sense that the daughters would not stand up to their mother during her bouts of bad behavior. It stretched credibility as well that Kevin Costner's character would want to spend a minute of his life in such an unhealthy atmosphere as his neighbor's home.

Joan Allen's character was so self-centered and mean-spirited that I had to go back in my mind to a film called ""Beaches"" to find an equally repellent screen matriarch. In ""The Upside of Anger,"" her character kicks her drinking habit. Unfortunately, there was no reforming of her shrewish, narcissistic personality.

This was the film that would never end!"

Permalink",True,"This incredibly smart witty movie stars Joan Allen and Kevin Costner in roles that far exceed any of their other performances. Kevin Costner entered a new dimension in his career, playing a seedy, over weight has-been with a large heart and incredible patience, with a woman who doesn't deserve him. Joan Allen plays a complex troubled, terribly thin (but that is not a story line) neurotic but sympathetic mother of four who apparently loses her husband to his Swedish secretary.. but maybe not...

Written and directed with humor, poignancy and incredible insight by Mike Binder, I hope this 2005 Terms of Endearment lives long enough to be considered for the 2006 academy awards. Films that open in March seem to be forgotten at the time that it matters. Kevin Costner and Joan Allen should be acknowledged..

Permalink",False,"Paranoia could be viewed as supreme egotism: why would everyone follow you? Why would they waste their time? Most things happen for reasons that have nothing to do with you. One thing I liked about this was it placed ""normal"" people in unusual, stressful situations and showed how they might react. Unfortunately, we often don't get a chance to work out our reactions in advance, as characters in a script. But it would be helpful not to strike back unless attacked. Maybe the point here was that anger can be useful, but ineffective if used indiscriminately. As dramatized in this family, there is a difference between ""speaking your mind"" and anger. Interesting plot twists, some implausible to some viewers. The ending summed up the message for me: why am I angry?

Permalink",True,"This must be the worst movie ever made! The story line is not even remotely plausible. A husband and a father of four daughters (ages from young teenager to early twenties) disappears one day. His wife automatically assumes that he took off with his Swedish secretary. There is no attempt to contact him. There are no family inquiries. No missing person report with the police. No investigation, or even curiosity as to what might have happened. The only reaction to his vanishing is that his wife turns practically overnight into a jaded drunk (""she used to be a very nice person""). When in the end (3 years later..) we find out that the man fell to his death into an abandoned well literally yards from his house, it feels like an insult to the viewer's intelligence. As preposterous as this scenario is, it does not stop Mike Binder from peppering the dialog with the pearls of his pseudo-wisdom about the human condition. This is a shallow and pretentious movie that leaves you feeling angry that you got duped into wasting 118 minutes of your life. I guess the upside of this anger is that I will never want to see another movie by M. Binder.

Good performance by Kevin Costner.

Permalink",True,"For the most part this movie was absolutely horrible. Joan Allen's acting is completely unbelievable and her character is incredibly annoying (although that is kind of the point). The whole plot is rather disconnected, things move from one thing to another without any real sense, all of the actions, emotions, etc (even with the daughters) don't have any real basis, you have no idea where these feelings or attitudes are coming from. Also, given that they know about their mothers' propensity towards anger, drinking, embarrassment, etc., they seem to continuously give her fodder....for example, at one daughter's graduation, they tell the mom that she is engaged to a boyfriend that she has never met, and then invites her to dinner with the fiancé and his family. Shockingly, she embarrasses them with her drinking and inappropriate comments--exacerbated by the fact that she is just hearing of something the other family appears to have known for a while. Or when one decides to have sex in her bedroom in her mothers' house (while she's home), or smoke weed in their bedroom. Not to mention the fact that none of the daughters seem too bothered by the fact that their father has apparently abandoned them. I will say that most of the acting by the daughters, and even Costner to a degree, is well-done, but unfortunately they are usually acting opposite of Joan Allen, so the scenes are destined to be horrible--but I think that the script itself may be unsalvageable (although I think even a Michele Pfiefer--a la ""deep end of the ocean"" or Meg Ryan--a la ""when a man loves a woman""--may have been able to make it more tolerable).

Permalink",False,"Certain films like ""The Upside of Anger"" resonate with IMDb contributors. In fact, the only reason we watched it was because of a kind friend's insistence in lending us a copy of the DVD. Mike Binder's film is not one of the worst things around, but if one really examines the basic premise about the head of the family's disappearance and never contacting his family in three years, it is just absurd.

What could have been so bad between Terry and her husband? True, he might have found another woman in his work place, which usually is the case, but to go away without ever contacting, at least, his daughters, doesn't make a bit of sense. Then again, what if he might have suffered an accident, or foul play was involved, why not go to the local police? These things are not explained in a movie that concentrates in how Terry, the wife, is left behind to drown herself in self pity and the vodka she seems to enjoy. We only see Terry getting on the phone to try to contact her former husband in Sweden, but she never completes the call.

The only valid excuse for watching this film is Joan Allen. But haven't we seen her before do other angry wives? While basically most of the comments are favorable for the film and her acting, this is a movie that doesn't deal with reality. The ending of the film proves how this family neglects to deal with it, especially Terry, who should have known better, but doesn't act on what should have been her primary concern about getting to the bottom of why the absent man leaves home without a trace.

The film is a variation of those Lifetime movies based on a supposedly true stories and targeted for women. Kevin Costner, who some people have praised to the high heavens is aging badly, as shown here and in ""Rumor has it"".

The movie defies the laws of credulity."

Did that scene with the two cars at the crossroads not feel entirely contrived ? Spoiler follows...

The spoiler is: if he really did die on the property that would mean his car never left -- don't you think someone would have done at least a cursory search of the grounds ??????

Permalink",False,"For some, The Upside of Anger will be little more than a beep under the radar. I guess part of the blame belongs to New Line Cinema's marketing campaign. With the prolific cast on board this doesn't seem too hard of a task (Or has Kevin Costner still not been forgiven for Waterworld?). Anyways, for those who do have the chance of seeing the film, they might find themselves enjoying the low-key romantic comedy. It's rather surprising a man directed The Upside of Anger, as it is more than anything else about female companionship. Director Mike Binder's look at these five women ranges from the ordinary (a character who has the ridiculous notion she's repulsive and fat) to the confusing (an utterly confounding where the women start laughing while a guy sits as oblivious as me). In a way, I feel like Kevin Costner's character- not always fully comprehending, yet oddly compelled.

Joan Allen plays Terry, a mother who suspects her husband is fooling around with a perky Swedish secretary. She finds comfort in the company of a retired baseball player (Kevin Costner) that she drinks with. It doesn't take too long for their relationship to turn physical and then something deeper yet. Terry has four daughters. The eldest (Alicia Witt) wants nothing more than to distance herself from Terry after college. Emily (Keri Russell) is a dancer workaholic who Terry is worried doesn't eat enough. Andy (Erika Christensen) is hired as a production assistant by the lowlife producer of Costner's radio show. And the youngest Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood) has a crush on a new kid.

Although it doesn't stray too far from the conventions of the genre, the film does try new things. Perhaps most notably, the Upside of Anger is a romantic comedy where the two characters rolling in the sheets (so to speak) aren't two attractive twenty-year olds. Also, while Terry and her daughters share a close relationship, they're rarely confidantes. A number of times they aren't even friendly to each other.

Also, Mike Binder effectively underplays the film. Something as mundane as a character slurping soup becomes an exercise in tense feelings. And the underplayed and relaxed nature helps draw attention to the performances. Kevin Costner's character could be imagined as the character in Bull Durham or Field of Dreams once the magic has gone. Although he's a drunk slob, he is also a kind and likable guy. All four daughters (particularly Evan Rachel Wood) give good performances. This movie however belongs to Joan Allen. Somewhat paradoxically with the film's underlying message, Allen's best scenes often draw from anger. In one scene, she catches Andy in bed with the producer and unable to say anything, she huffs off in Olympian fury.

For most of its one-hundred-thirty-five minute length, The Upside of Anger is a pleasant romantic comedy with something to say."

The twist was also a joke. I mean if someone left they would obviously take there most important documentation and still use credit cards or bank cards etc, so how the wife didn't know her husband really ran off was beyond me.

Also movie claimed to have comedy aspects, but it wasn't funny at all.

Actually Kevin Costner is a great actor/guy in this movie, but it seems unrealistic that he would be interested in the horrible character 'Terry Ann'. Even in the movie he explains his attraction to her despite the tension in the house etc. It wasn't believable.

It seems to me that the director was trying to put too many different facets of emotion in the film... abandonment, grieve, anger, despair, self pity, humor, hatred, cynicism. As a divorced mother of six, some of the lines ""hit too close to home"" so that tells me that the essence of the pain was captured. I am still thinking about the ending which really surprised me. I can't even begin to imagine how a wife who felt as she did could handle that. All in all it was a good movie, and I recommend it to anyone who has lost control of their anger in trying to deal with disappointment and resentment.

Permalink",True,"Joan Allen plays a woman with three teen-aged daughters and one finishing college. We learn that her husband has recently left her and we witness how she copes by drinking and neglecting her children. She becomes reacquainted with her neighbor, played by a doughy Kevin Costner, an aging former baseball star that now makes his living doing a lousy radio show and by selling his signature on baseballs. They become drinking buddies and sex partners. The mother turns her love and attention to vodka rather than the children that were also left behind. She does absolutely nothing to find her husband (aside from calling directory assistance in Sweden and Googling that same nation) and so the husband pays no child support and isn't divorced. Interestingly, we see no attempt for Joan Allen's character to support herself and one has to wonder after a later scene when a daughter is hospitalized how they still had any health insurance. Instead, we see Joan Allen's character drinking, driving through the neighborhood too fast and sleeping with her neighbor ... while we are told that she used to be very sweet, that the anger of being left changed her into this.

I found none of the characters to be especially likable on any level. And, why should we care at all about the daughters if even their own mother doesn't care? This felt more like a bad, made-for-Lifetime TV movie rather than something worthy of this decent cast that was completely wasted.

I would recommend this movie.

The most clever aspect of this movie is the use of black humour. There are a number of scenes in which Joan Allen's character is over reacting or angry and the moments are both upsetting and hilarious at the same time.

Permalink",False,"With 'The Upside of Anger,' Mike binder makes another stab at trying to be the Woody Allen of yuppie angst. Binder's last attempt in this genre--the exasperating 'Mind of the Married Man,' HBO's first and shortest-lived male-oriented take on 'Sex and the City'--was undermined by a pathological cynicism about the nature of love and the institution of marriage. The protagonist of that program (portrayed, in true Woody Allen style, by Binder himself) seemed constitutionally incapable of being satisfied with his enormous good fortune--great job, beautiful, intelligent, sensitive wife, newborn baby, etc. The show seemed to suggest that even the most picture-perfect of marriages is always on the brink of oblivion.

In 'The Upside of Anger,' Binder skips the brink and heads straight for the oblivion. Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) wakes up one morning to find herself abruptly abandoned by her husband, who has disappeared, presumably with his Swedish assistant to start a new life, leaving Terry in the lurch with their four precocious daughters--one in college, one a recent high school graduate who has elected not to pursue higher education, and two others still in high school. Terry immediately sets about drowning her sorrows in an endless flood of vodka, and almost instantaneously commences a combative flirtation with Denny (Kevin Costner), a washed up former baseball star who lives around the block, supporting himself with a sports radio show in which he refuses to discuss sports and by selling autographed memorabilia. We are assured by the girls (the film is narrated in voice-over by the youngest, 'Popeye,' played by Evan Rachel Wood) that Terry was once a sweet, caring, unassuming suburban housewife, but for the duration of the film she is a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown, swilling more vodka than a Russian sailor, picking fights with everyone from her daughters to Denny to the old guy down the street who chastens her for driving too fast through the neighborhood.

Allen's performance is typically superb, and it's fun (for a while, anyway) to watch her play against type. Costner--borrowing heavily from Jack Nicholson's turn in 'Terms of Endearment'--is refreshingly relaxed, likable, and humble (he put on 20 pounds for the role) as Denny, a has-been lush with a good heart who sees in Terry and her family a way to restore some meaning to his purposeless existence. Binder appears again, this time as Shep, Denny's sleazy radio producer, who seduces Terry's daughter Andy (Erika Christensen), which provides the catalyst for the film's most visceral confrontation (Shep gets his comeuppance, and while he deserves it, it's hard not to feel as if Binder is offering a sort of twisted mea culpa for the crime that was 'The Mind of the Married Man').

The girls all acquaint themselves well enough, but there isn't enough room in the picture for any of them to really resonate. Terry is most at odds with Hadley (Alicia Witt), the eldest, but beyond the natural mother-daughter tension, it's hard to see where the conflict stems from. Andy's dalliance with Shep gives Allen some great material to freak out over, but Andy seems almost to be just an excuse to get Binder's character into the mix. Keri Russell is lovely and appealing as Emily, whose ambition to be a ballerina is stifled by Terry's controlling pragmatism, and Evan Rachel Wood's Popeye is a pleasure to watch, even if she seems a bit excessively insightful and eloquent for 14--but with so many subplots hovering around a central plot line without a whole lot of acute tension, Binder's efforts to develop all 4 girls leaves the picture feeling muddy and unfocused.

And, of course, after all of the kvetching and public outbursts, Binder wraps everything up in a neat little bow with a surprising but highly unlikely twist at the end, so that everyone gets to live happily ever after. Most problematic is that the twist--which I won't reveal here--ends up undermining and effectively erasing the significance of Terry's emotional roller coaster, around which the entire picture is structured. There are other problems as well: why doesn't Terry have any friends, or, at the very least, any neighbors other than Denny checking in on her? Wouldn't one of the daughters at least try to contact their father, for Terry's sake if not their own? How much money do these people have, and where's it all coming from? With her husband gone, Terry seems to do nothing but drink with Denny and go to the grocery store--what did she do with herself before her husband disappeared?

The dialog is witty and urbane, and it's fun to watch charming and attractive actors populating the pristine suburban environs (the film is almost worth watching just for Terry's kitchen and dining room), so the film has its pleasures. It merely fails to achieve the sort of profound insight it seems to be grasping for. This is, in essence, the fatal flaw of Binder's style: despite all of the wit and neurotic humor, in the end, he wants us to get 'the moral of the story.' He is perhaps a bit too eager to tell the audience what it's all supposed to mean, and that, by god, this is important stuff. I mean, really--how seriously can we take the neurosis of a woman who lives in a million-dollar home, has extensive funds and no need to work, four gorgeous and intelligent girls, and a hunky good-time-Charlie around the corner who smiles and strokes her ego when she vents her spleen at him? Binder would be much better served to do away with the trite, pedantic narration and put his trust in the talents of Joan Allen, who, even as a bitter alcoholic, transmits the kind of wisdom and insight even the finest of writers are rarely capable of on their best days."

The reason it didn't get more stars out of me is because my expectations were so far off that it made it hard to enjoy it for what it was.

Permalink",True,"I suppose Mike Binder (or maybe the film's producers) thought that ""The Upside of Anger"" was a provocative name for a movie. The problem, however, is that it has nothing to do with the movie. OK...Joan Allen is bitter and angry the entire movie. She doesn't grow, she doesn't evolve, she doesn't change. Fine, but don't call this movie ""The Upside of Anger"" then.

Also, how were these 4 girls ""sisters""? I think they were all pretty much the same age. Indeed, I think 3 of the girls are in high school. We know that Evan Rachel Wood is the 15 year old. But little reference is made to Erika Christenson or Keri Russell. Neither look very much like High School students anyway. I saw that Erika Christenson's brother was in the cast...me thinks that's why she signed onto this film.

Real and meaningful topics (alcoholism, teen angst, etc.) are glossed over with trite answers and actions, and we're supposed to be impressed.

""The Upside of Anger"" tries to be deep, thinks that it's deep, but is actually rather shallow.

Almost everything in the film happens according to movie convention, except for a surprise near the end, which I found ludicrous. (P.S. I thought Kevin Costner was good. I think he made me laugh without squirming on one occasion, though I can't remember which, at the moment.)

Permalink",True,"The Upside of Anger epitomizes bad direction. The pacing was off, the music was distracting and the voice overs were needless and lazy.

I am hoping that the movie is re-edited before it actually hits theaters. This movie is about a somewhat quirky mom and her four quirky daughters and her quirky neighbor. One of the reasons for poor pacing is that the movie tries to tell individual stories about each of the four children in addition to the main story, but it is only and hour and a half long.

Almost all of the character choices made are heavy handed. Alicia Witt looks as though she was told to look sardonic at almost all times. Let's make Kevin Costner into something of a pig. But wait, let's make him into kind of a lovable pig.

The movie seems to be very aware of itself as a movie. It seems like there are points put in as obvious foreshadowing, but not in a good way - they stick out like a sore thumb. Since the opening scene is at a funeral (not really a spoiler since it is the first scene, but since they will hopefully remove that first scene, it may turn into one), every time you see someone in a car or someone on a bike, the question became ""Is this the person who dies?"" When does it happen, when does it happen?

And seriously, a girl named Popeye? Really?

Permalink",False,"If one had set out to make the worst movie possible, it couldn't be this bad. A movie this bad must come from a confluence of factors beyond human control. And what makes this movie even worse, is that Costner is good and so is his friend ""Shep"". It is extraordinary that a movie with anything good, can turn out so bad -- it's like Kobe scoring 50 and the Lakers still lose. Everybody else must have REALLY been terrible. This is an ""Ordinary People"" derivative but there are no ""people"" in it. The movie violates several key ""rules"". First, it tries to tell the story of about 7 people and that's just too many characters. The characters thus lack development. Second there is no back story created. Third the story is ""told"", rather than ""shown"". So the story jumps from one random event to another and each ""character"" responds to the events equally randomly. Nothing that happens makes sense and nothing anyone does makes sense. You could say, ""yes, but isn't that what life is really like?"", but the answer has to be ""No, that's not what life is like, actually""; and it's certainly not what good movies are like. This movie is inane and banal beyond words. I just have that feeling if we knew the story of the making there's some explanation like, ""the writer quit"", the director was going through a cancer treatment or the studio insisted they change the script the day before release because it wasn't testing good with 13 year old boys."

Permalink",True,"Those expecting to see your conventional Hollywood romantic comedy will instead have a chance to view a film that refreshingly doesn't apologize for flaws the characters demonstrate and for the most part shy's away from most story contrivances. Story is about Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) who lives with her four daughters and is still feeling the incredible pain of her husband abandoning them. Terry drinks and lounges around the house watching coverage of the Iraq war on television as her daughters cook the meals and generally keep the house running. One day Terry is visited by her neighbor Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) who drinks a lot also and the two of them end up hanging out together and eventually starting a romance that leaves them both unsure of where it will lead.

*****SPOILER ALERT***** Denny is a sports radio host and former baseball player who never made much money and spends his time at home sipping Budweiser beer and autographing memorabilia to sell to fans. Terry is having trouble with her daughters such as Andy (Erika Christensen) who starts dating Denny's producer Shep (Mike Binder) who is in his 40's and also Emily (Keri Russell) who wants to be a dancer but ends up in the hospital. Terry also has to deal with Hadley (Alicia Witt) who unexpectedly announces she's pregnant and is going to be married, and also her youngest daughter Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood) who is in high school and is having a relationship (of some sort) with a boy who's gay.

This is written and directed by Mike Binder who plays Shep in the film and I think he does an admirable job of making sure that his script avoids the usual romantic comedy clichés although some critics lambasted him for the plot twist at the end. I personally didn't dislike the ending but I do feel that the film could be received just as strongly (or even more) without the revelation about Terry's husband. Binder's script asks the viewer to absorb a lot especially with all the subplots involving the 4 daughters and this does give the film's structure a sloppy appeal as it wanders back and forth from comedy and drama. The story in some ways is reminiscent of something James L. Brooks would write as the film gives the opportunity for it's characters to show both their humorous and serious sides and Allen is very much like Shirley MacLaine in ""Terms of Endearment"" as she struggles with family issues. Allen is very strong here and gives an unflinching performance as she allows her character to be very flawed and very human and the way Costner's Denny reacts to her is both realistic and poignant. I'm not one of those who walked away thinking I saw a very special film but I do think I viewed something that (for the most part) remained true to what the characters were really about and avoided the usual Hollywood contrivances.

Permalink",False,"When you take time out to see a movie, it is always a great blessing when the film is cleverly written, seamlessly executed, and wonderfully acted. Such is the experience you take home when viewing ""The Upside of Anger"".

One might have described the genre as a classic melodrama years ago when the term was used to characterize family dramas where women struggled with their situation or gave voice to once- repressed desires. However, I would describe it as a comedy-drama with a wonderful mix of characters, plot, and extraordinary flow.

Galvanized by a wonderful and clever script, and stimulated by truly incredible performances by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner, ""Upside of Anger"" is a welcome and inspired account of a family struggling with the unexpected abandonment by the father of four girls. Writer/director Mike Binder deserves all the tribute the fans and critics will likely bestow upon him for this superbly rendered comedic drama, which is at once traditional and iconoclastic as well as absorbing and entertaining, as it is essentially human. It is a perfect blend of humor and sadness, consistent with real people that anyone can identify with. Each character is uniquely and expertly developed into several complex layers, each of which is interesting in its own right.

The tale commences when the alcoholic matriarch of a well to do Detroit family discerns that her husband has abandoned her thus leaving her to raise four determined daughters, all of who are in various stages of young adulthood. She feels lost being on her own, without any obvious means of support. Her angry, drunken rants fuel her already combative parenting style, and the story kicks off its comical meandering through a complex familial matrix when Costner, as a middle-aged, quirky yet real and perfectly lovable neighbor, makes a play for her attention. Mike Binder, who also is the director of this film, skillfully plays a character that at first you have to laugh at, later despise, and finally sympathize with as well as laugh at once more. The supporting cast, which includes Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell, and Alicia Witt, skillfully facilitate this exquisite interpretation of a family's emotional transformation to become one of the most pleasurable and surprisingly unpredictable romantic dramas I have seen in a very long time.

This clever and rare comedy should not be missed. Although the average American film-goer may be disappointed with it's absence of car chases and gratuitous violence, the fine quality of the acting and the superb story may ultimately speak to the culturally deprived and vacuous mentalities that may hopefully mature and broaden their fertile minds."

Permalink",False,"This movie was horrible, the acting was good, but it was the same scene over and over again. The actors never grew or changed, the plot never grew. There were many mini plots that were never developed, the plot as a whole was under developed. This movie had potential to be a very good thought provoking interesting film but fell far short. The supposed theme of anger was touched but mostly this movie was just about an angry woman drinking, venting, and ignoring her children. Unless you are are a die hard Costner fan, and even then you probably won't enjoy this movie, don't waste your time or money. The movie did have a couple laughable moments, but over all was slow, un-intriguing and is the first movie I have ever considered walking out on but stayed thinking maybe at the end everything would tie together and be redeeming. But no such luck.

Permalink",True,"Good films are almost always nested in some way. This is a good. Oh, its not because Joan Allen is a good actress. I suppose she is, but her character here is an easy one to play and pretty much goes nowhere. And it is not so much because of Costner, though he really does act here: every nuance is perfect, even the not quite natural laugh. He's trained away that thin wavery voice.

No this is a good one because of how it is structured, _and_ that all involved are competent.

The structuring is of multiple nesting. One nesting: We see a funeral at the very beginning. As the movie progresses, we see it is a remake of ""Terms of Endearment."" Or so we think. Four daughters, each with a story  which one will die? There are at least two false leads until we realize that we are being toyed with.

This film is centered on Mike Binder's character. He has written himself in as producer, a radio show as surrogate for the movie. It stars Costner's character from his other competent movie: ""Bull Durham,"" but later in life. Costner brings up a woman in the show, and everything follows from that, including and entanglement with a daughter.

Another fold: one daughter is a performer, another a producer (aspiring at first) another a producer literally. A final fold: the youngest daughter narrates the film, which is the very film she is making on her iBook.

Its this structure that allows us to be captured by the story, and the characters and the situation they spin.

Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

Permalink",False,"Joan Allen is in superb form here, abandoned by her husband, angry, and left to deal with four teenage girls  although they deal with her just as much.

It's a little long  all her girls go through various troubles  but her relationship with Kevin Costner (a retired alcoholic baseball player) is fascinating, as both characters are flawed and intriguing. The acting is brilliant...Allen could be up for an Oscar nomination she's so good, and this is Costner's best performance since 'A Perfect World'.

Writer/director Mike Binder's movie is populated by real and flawed people. It's an honest look how anger can effect people; admittedly, he needs someone to edit his own performances a bit, and there are plot holes, but this is still a good movie.

Permalink",False,"Joan Allen and Kevin Costner will be hard to overlook come award time thanks to Mike Binder's fine writing and quirky direction in this dark comedy about relationships that we're all familiar with. How our two main characters try to drink their pain away and still manage to function pretty normally is portrayed without a lot of drama--just like real life. How Allen's four daughters deal their own loss and also face a parent in turmoil with way TOO much drama--also just like real life--is also beautifully explored. The story has Allen has assuming her husband has run off with his Swedish secretary--he just didn't come home one night. Sloppy neighbor Costner is perfect as the washed up, retired baseball player who likes hanging out and experiencing the real life of the Wolfmeyer household. Each of the gorgeous four daughters is given plenty to do and each one does it perfectly. Binder himself has a key role in the film, making mischief and creating an unexpectedly explosive moment. What's fun about this film is that we know and relate to these people. What's touching about this film is that Binder and the actors give us a sense of the pain of loss yet show us that no matter what happens we can learn and grow from it. The ending is a surprise. Some like it, some don't. In honor of Costner's character, I'll go with a baseball analogy and say that life can be a funny at-bat sometimes. The ending of this movie is quite a change-up. But that's the way life is. I loved the ending. Made me think."

Permalink",False,"This movie is one of the best movies I have seen this year. This script was absolutely genius.

This movie takes you through so many emotions. I love the fact that they chose to show a real life perspective of how people deal with the loss of Father and Husband.

This movie deals with so many issues. It was well acted and I will be upset if Joan Allen does not get an Oscar nod. She was absolutely superb in this film.

Kevin Costner did a great job. It's been a while since I've seen him and he's really grown a lot as an actor. A couple more films like this he will be getting Oscar nods himself.

It's been a while since a saw an ensemble cast with this many well-developed character. I loved this movie on every level you can love a movie.

My only complaint was that it ended. I was so drawn into this movie that I am dying for more. I want to know what happens in their life after the curtains close.

This movie will be one that slips under the radar for movie goer's but they are missing out on great experience.

This is my favorite movie so far this year! That's a big statement for me, because I watch so many movies."

Permalink",False,"Are you looking for a romantic comedy that is witty and sardonic? Look no further, The Upside of Anger is a refreshing addition to the mundane crop of movies currently at theaters. What makes this movie stand out are the acting and a very smart script. Joan Allen and Kevin Costner have chemistry on the screen. Their performances are so raw as two alcoholics that you can't wait to see them in the next scene together. It's nice to see actors playing alcoholics in a realistic manner. They aren't playing these characters as sloppy drunks that need to slur their words to convince you that they are truly intoxicated. That's an nice touch.

Credit needs to go to Mike Binder, who wrote and directed this movie. He also plays a radio producer with some very funny moments scattered through the film. The script seems to find its way from one scene to the next. It's not predictable so it does keep your attention. You do want to find out what happens next to these characters.

Joan Allen plays Terry Wolfmeyer, a rich, suburban housewife that suspects her husband has runaway with his Swedish assistant. Kevin Costner plays Denny Davies, her neighbor as a washed-up baseball player. The two seem to connect to each other and the relationship is truly fun to watch. When you watch them together, you really are rooting for them. You want them to hook up. Beyond having alcohol in common, they make a good couple.

You have to tip your hat to casting in this film. The four daughters are all solid actresses. Alicia Witt plays Hadley who is the eldest and goes to college. College seems to be her way out of the house of chaos. Erika Christiansen plays Andy who decides to break the mold of Hadley and go straight to work. She lands a job at Denny's radio show. Keri Russell (of Felicity) plays Emily who wants to be a dancer to her mother's objections. Lastly, Evan Rachel Wood (of Once and Again) plays the youngest and who narrates the story.

The movie has some sobering messages at the end. I liked how they had an opening shot that ties into the climax of the picture. It definitely makes you think about how life can throw you a curve ball now and again. However, if you accept change as part of the journey, you can grow from it. This movie was a pleasant surprise and I highly recommend it."

Permalink",False,"Just an awful movie from start to finish. Whatever elements of humor there were were drowned out by the poor structure and awful dialogue. The daughters all looked totally uncomfortable as they tried to pretend they were sisters. And Joan Allen is completely one- dimensional.

The biggest flaw of the movie was that there was little explanation for anyone's actions. People acted angry but they never got to the root of that anger. They never showed reasons. It became hard to empathize with any of the characters. The ending is completely idiotic and forced. This was a huge waste of potential. Handled by an able director, it could have been really good.

If I had realized that it was written and directed by Mike Binder, there's no way I would have spent the money! This was an unfocused mess of a story, exactly like his attempted men's-Sex-In-The-City ripoff ""Mind of the Married Man""! All he does is string some anecdotes together, have Joan Allen react and overreact, and call that a movie! It's more of a collection of short stories than anything with any depth, cohesiveness, or overall story. I cannot understand why this guy continually gets chances to write and direct. He's not actually bad as an actor, but his sense of story is pathetic. And wow, IMDb says his next movie is with Ben Affleck, who made yet another mistake piggybacking on this guy if he is trying to save his career!

Joan Allen gives a good performance but her character is childish; the screenplay is asinine and the film is badly directed by Mike Bender, the guy who created the lame HBO show Minds of the Married Man, or something. It's as if he thought he was making a Woody Allen move but failed to inject into it any humor or drama that's humane. Kevin Costner is pretty good but his character is given little to do but look stupid and/or in the way. I was hoping the movie would turn the tables and have fun with the characters and stop making them out to be Stepfordians.

There are not enough mature movies for us folks that are no longer teenagers. My wife and I gave Upside a chance. Joan Allen is fantastic and Kevin Costner was interesting as a failed man finding redemption. The rest of the movie's characters, with the exception of Popeye, were clichéd and boring. Sorry, the young actresses are attractive and charming but the roles were trite. Now lets talk about the story and writing. Dialog was marginal and the story was preposterous. Without giving away the plot twists I would just say that these plot lines got in the way of an otherwise really good story about a woman who found her world upside down without the man she was married to for many years. Mike Binder needs a little discipline and a little faith in himself and a little faith in the audience.

Permalink",False,"In the suburb of Detroit, the upper middle class Terry Ann Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) becomes a bitter woman when her husband apparently leaves her family and her, traveling with his Swedish secretary to her country. Her neighbor and close friend of the family, the lonely retired baseball player Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) and presently working in a talk-show in a radio, continues visiting Terry and her daughters, and drinking with Terry. Denny falls in love for Terry, but the wounded and full of anger Terry try to avoid a steady relationship with him. Meanwhile, life does not stop, and her daughters graduate, date, marry, sicken, as part of the dynamics of a family. Many years later, a profound secret is revealed.

""The Upside of Anger"" is an unconventional fable about a woman that becomes bitter, quite drunkard and full of an absolutely misplaced anger. The dramatic story, the situation and the characters are very real and credible, what is very rare in a romance, and the movie does not have usual clichés. The theme is very interesting, and many times people feel anger for something but do not investigate the reasons and motive for that thing happens, the truth behind the happening. In this movie, the unexpected plot point gives a strong twist in the narrative. Further, families raise sons and daughters giving the same treatment and education, but personalities make people very different, like Terry's daughters. The awesome Joan Allen steals the movie, as usual, although the whole cast has great performances. There are some funny scenes, like for example when Adam 'Shep' Goodman (Mike Binder) is making noise while eating soup with Terry's family; or when Denny surprises Terry in the bathroom. I believe this film deserves to be watched a second time for a deeper analysis of the behavior of each character. My vote is six.

Permalink",True,"The success of The Upside of Anger owes first and foremost to its excellent script. This comes across particularly acutely to me as I've just watched Revenge of the Sith which is full of dialogue such as ""You're a good person. Don't do this"", Padme imploring Anakin not to turn to the dark side. (Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed Revenge, among the many great qualities of which, however, I cannot conscientiously include writing). In The Upside of Anger, every time you expect to hear an agonizingly cliché line, you get a delightful surprise in something slightly unexpected but still totally in tune. It's these continuous little extras that will make you remember this romance comedy while you forget most of the others.

While there are disagreements on many things about this movie, in professional reviews and user comments alike, one verdict is amazingly unanimous, that the performance Joan Allen and Kevin Costner are near perfect. Yet, even with this unanimity, there are two schools: that Allen rules and Costner supports, and that they are well-balanced and fully complementary. Mine accords with the latter.

No question that Allen shines so bright that you almost have to blink. While you can write a book on her brilliant performance in every scene in the movie, I'll just refer to two seconds, and three words she utters when she hears about daughter Hadley's second pregnancy, starting with ""jeez"" and ending with ""wow"". In those two seconds and with those three words, Allen shows how she has perfected the art of acting. The unforgettable impression Allen is able to leave with the audience is due undoubtedly to her topnotch performance, but is also helped by the fiery character she plays.

Costner, however, is with her every step, without missing a beat. And he does it with a relaxing ease that is not easy to come by, but required a seasoned maturity that Costner has attained.

Each of the 4 girls has a special charm. Alicia Witt playing the oldest, Hedley, has the right balance between matured tolerance and not-yet-burned-out defiance. Next comes Andy, played wonderfully by Erika Christensen who, underneath the rebellions on the surface, is the most matured and stable of the four, the balancing and calming factor of the family. Most interesting to note that upon the breaking up of the short affair with ""Shep"" the perpetual letch, it's not the young girl, but the dirty old man who is whining like someone who has been cheated and taken advantage of. Despite a striking resemblance with Nicole Kidman, Keri Russell is the least impressive partly because the role she plays, Emily the third daughter, is one-dimensional, with a passion for ballet but not much else. Evan Rachel Wood has the most crowd-pleasing role playing the know-it-all youngest daughter ""Popeye"" who is also given the task of the voice off narrator, through her project report on the subject of anger.

Must say a word about the twist. Many consider themselves cheated. On this one, I happen to agree with Ebert (which I don't often do) that rather than taking something away from the movie, it added to it another dimension. As a romance comedy, what goes on before the twist is just fine, and probably sufficient. But if we give any respect at all to the title, and allow the movie at least the benefit of the doubt to its claim as a treatise on the subject of anger, it is surely quite clear why the twist takes it up to another level. Joan Allen has done a suburb job portraying the anger. Even if it's walking a tightrope (not a totally satisfactory illustration, I admit), she is so sure footed. But imagine the wire below her feet all of a sudden snapping, and there's no more tightrope to ground on. This gives Allen an opportunity to lift her performance to yet another level, portraying this ""free fall"" from mid-air. Maybe this gives her just a slight edge over Costner after all.

Permalink",False,"I went reluctantly to see ""The Upside of Anger"" because so many professional critics loved it. ""Kevin Costner's career resuscitation!"" they bellowed. ""A masterpiece"" others crowed. I will give credit where credit is due in that Kevin Costner delivers a good performance for the first time since his late-1980's peak. But overall, was a well-acted but otherwise unremarkable older-chick-flick that followed most of the tired older-chick-flick clichés (ex-husband who leaves for younger mistress, gay male best friend, tension with kids, finding romance after giving up on it, etc.).

Director Mike Binder, not content to be the poor man's Larry David (e.g. ""Mind of the Married Man"", ""The Sex Monster""), directs his own script, which has a surprise twist at the end, but which is otherwise unremarkable.

Joan Allen--angry and bitter throughout--plays an alcoholic but otherwise unremarkable woman whose husband has presumably just left her for his younger mistress (we are left in the dark until the end). She swears off relationships for about ten minutes, then starts a romance with her next door neighbor, who used to be a major league ballplayer, but who is otherwise unremarkable. She has four beautiful, but otherwise unremarkable daughters, and she resents that they want to be something other than bitter when they get older.

There is a lot of talk throughout about the issues that older women have, particularly with men who leave them for younger women, but it's mostly an excuse to see Joan Allen throw tantrums. And the lack of a coherent plot makes the exercise not worth it.

Professional critics are always grumbling that there are few leading roles for actresses over 40, and so they always seem to overpraise films like ""The Upside of Anger"" or ""Something's Gotta Give"" that star older actresses but are. . .do I really need to finish this sentence? 5 out of 10."

Permalink",False,"""Upside of Anger"" is not just a vehicle for an astounding and unpredictable performance by Joan Allen.

Unlike most dominating mothers in movies, from ""Stella Dallas"" to ""Terms of Endearment,"" which this film starts to imitate then transcends with more multidimensionality, and since, her ""Terry Wolfmeyer"" is a real woman with ups and downs and contradictory waves of emotion and control. A scene where she is trying to be nice to a daughter's surprise fiancé was priceless, as she is as vulnerable as she is judgmental, with men and with her daughters.

And unlike Annette Bening's bravura diva in ""Being Julia,"" Allen gets to interact with a wonderful cast. It is the best evocation of a household of sisters since ""Virgin Suicides"" in a much more positive estrogen-fest, even if having four of them is a bit much and a bit confusing (Were they all in diapers at the same time? That would be enough to permanently drive the mom over the edge and certainly justify that she's never considered working outside the home which isn't even considered).

So it's that much more surprising that it is written and directed by Mike Binder, whose previous macho oeuvre includes the most boring and pretentious buddy movie with a young hunk cast in ""Crossing the Bridge"" and the unfunny and obnoxious sitcom ""Mind of A Married Man."" So it is appropriate that he takes on for himself the role of the jejune schmuck of the piece, a guy who represents just about all that is wrong with men.

His character and Allen's are crucially triangulated by an absolutely wonderful Kevin Costner, literally portraying a retired version of his baseball pro in ""For Love of the Game,"" as he autographs stills from that film. Key is that his character, and the film, actually like women, while the women learn not to give up on men. His choice to be a grown-up with women, whether as a lover or father figure, is the keystone of the film, allowing the mom to finally admit that needing someone isn't a capitulation.

In addition to the marvelous dialog, the production design of their living environments dovetails with the emotional differences between the men and the women, such that we really understand Costner's character's stammered explanation of why he prefers being at her house, slamming doors and all.

I'm not sure the flashback structure completely works, except to tease as we tensely wonder which action will lead to the opening denouement.

The only false notes are the youngest daughter's voice-over from a pretentious school project video she is producing with unnecessary and stereotyped images of gender and family relations and some confusing factual and chronological points, such as why another daughter's physical problems aren't identified as anorexia and how is the mom paying her bills in that amply luxurious suburb.

I think the lovely Mark Cohn track over the closing credits is a new song."

Permalink",False,"Have you ever been in a room where you didn't know anyone, but they all knew each other? You know they have a secret because you can see the smirks and the condescending chuckles, but no one volunteers to share it with you. You get the idea that the ""secret"" is of no consequence, but the fact that they can keep you excluded is the whole point. That's the way this movie made me feel.

The writer(s) has either had a completely different social upbringing than I had, or is simply not able to make character's communicate how they feel. Terry Wolfmeyer spends the movie in either an alcoholic blank stare, or vicious assaults on every other character. The story alludes to the fact that she changes, but I never saw any difference.

Logic is also a short coming. Denny Davies enters Terry's life at a time when she is the most angry and unforgiving she has ever been. Yet this neighbor with no redeeming qualities and with the only apparent endearing feature being that he keeps showing up and imposing, becomes the superior male figure that we are supposed to embrace. Sorry, but you are going to have to do better than that. The character up on the screen is going to have to ""earn"" my embrace (See movie ""RAY"")."

Permalink",False,"The movie was okay. I thought Joan Allen, Alicia Witt, Erika Christenson, Keri Russell and Evan Rachel Wood were terrific in their roles. I'm a big Kevin Costner fan, but I don't see this as one of his best performances. It seemed as if he spent the first half-hour channeling Jack Nicholson, but Costner was much better during the rest of the movie, as his character, Denny, evolved.

I thought Mike Binder was good as the sleazy producer. But I had problems with Binder's writing; I didn't think he chronicled the passage of time that well, and some plot elements didn't make much sense. I did enjoy the music score; I know a lot of people haven't, but it's different, quirky. One thing, though: I scratch my head at the comparison of Denny to Crash Davis in Bull Durham. If Denny's like any Bull Durham character, it's probably Nuke LaLoosh.

Permalink",False,"""Upside Of Anger"" is beautifully done, and it is a film that touches the heart. If one has not yet seen it, don't panic. Just see it. And if one has seen it, see it again on DVD. There is so very much to behold in this romantic comedy drama, that one can hardly begin. In addition, I am reluctant to tell too much in fear of giving away the story. Joan Allen is delicious in her portrayal of a young housewife who has recently found her husband missing. Kevin Costner plays her neighbor who portrays an ex baseball player who is currently a disc jockey on a local radio station. He is also just as eager to imbibe the vodka as she and does so without reservation. The dialog is superb, and the screenplay is ingenious. This film is a ""must see"" for all couples, and I give it as many thumbs up as possible. Don't let this one slip by.

What do you mean I'm digressing?

This projects what is truly his ""own voice""; I don't particularly like the term but here it is more than appropriate. This is a very funny film in its own different kind of way, although it not a comedy is, and its intentions regarding matters serious get through quite well also, though they occasionally get slightly overshadowed by the off-the-wall hilarity. Oh, what colourful analysis on my part!

We are cleverly mislead, too, slightly unsuitable considering the rest as the result of that may be. See it to know what I'm trying to imply. I ultimately see this as a good thing. I think. No, the misleading positive, but the thing itself... Meh.

Terrific, semi-surprisingly, leading performances and quality support honour the writing which is excellent when observed from little distance and a little less so when one sees it from afar. Binder himself steals scenes. How nice of him to offer himself a juicy role.

Flawless it ain't, but this is 2005's best film so far. Sure, I've only seen five so far, but who's counting? This'll remain in my top five of this year for some while, thanks to the very enjoyable, different dialogue and portrayals of much excellence. Besides, that is one gorgeous quintet."

Everyone calls me and says 'who is this guy? He's awesome.' Even my ex-wife liked him. His show was the best thing HBO ever did next to the Sopranos and they were FOOLS to take it off. Now he comes along with this movie which I would never have seen if it weren't for him because A) I hate Joan Allen, and I can't stand anything that Kevin Costner has done in years. But the amazing thing is they are both awesome in this movie. It is so good. We were in Costa Rica when it came out and was told by a friend we had missed it and missed a big story on Binder in the NY TIMES and we went to see it in a small theater where it still is and I have to say I loved it. This is my first time on this sites boards but I was so excited about the movie. Kevin Costner can act. He really can. He's older and fatter (who isn't??) and he's losing hair (been there done that) and he's GREAT.JUST GREAT!! Warm and funny as hell and perfect. Really perfect. He makes the movie great in my opinion. Joan Allen is skinny and not my type and I can only take the steam coming out of her ears for so long but boy can she act. This is a world class performance. She needs to be nominated for this. So does Costner and so does Binder for screenplay. He;s also great as Skep Denny's sidekick. Really really funny role. Brave role to take I think.

THE ENDING... (don't read on if you haven't seen it!!!)

The NEW YORK TIMES GUY A.O. SCOTT is the worst reviewer working. He is so wrong about the ending. It is right on and perfect. Blew me away and I was sitting there waiting for the surprise. I can only imagine if this SOB and the other cheap shot reviewers hadn't gotten into the whole surprise ending thing. It was a great ending. Mind blowing. Wow. This is the kind of movie that will still be great forty five years from now. Roger Ebert is right. This is a classic. Binder is a modern day Woody Allen or a James L.Brooks. My favorite kind of comedies. I am so glad and fired up to finally see this guy taking off. Come on academy awards. Give Binder an Oscar for this one!!!!!!!!!!

Mike has written a script that demonstrates all the best ways to construct a story for multiple audiences - dare I say a four-quadrant script? Females - women of all ages, (Romance/drama) Teens (4 sisters struggling with their identities, ambitions, going out with the wrong guy and dealing with divorce - one a ballerina), guys - young and older(Kevin/baseball - sexy women) and families - the whole divorce, sibling relationships etc etc. And best of all - the intriguing twist at the end makes you (firstly) question your idea of the characters which have all changed during the course of the film, but damn it - still makes you feel good about them, the story and yourselves.

Kevin Costner is back and has found a new weight to his acting (not a pun on the pounds he put on to play this role) He is older, better, wiser and more of an entertainer than he has ever been. Hats off to Mr Dances with Wolves for reinventing himself with this wonderful little film. I was blown away by him and by Joan Allen. The dance that the two of these two actors do in this movie should be an acting lesson to young thespians and a tutorial to young directors. They are so in tune with each other and such a yin yang push pull acting energy exists that you find yourself in the dark unable to take your eyes off of them.

This is also a HUGE move forward for Mike Binder. I was not big on his TV show but I have friends that spoke of nothing but it. I did always like him in stand up comedy as a young guy and knew he would have a good future in the business. This puts him in the Woody Allen category though. I mean that positively of course, because I am a fan of Woody Allen's even though no one else is. I think Binder has jumped into that class and the league of James W. Brooks who did Terms of endearment and Broadcast news.

I am not a person who normally writes on these sites but as I say I was blown away by Costner, Joan, and Mike. All three of them deserve Oscar nods for this one. What a film.

Permalink",False,"and was just as effective as Faye would have been in this role, and that is saying a whole lot. She was just incredible! Where the heck has Joan been, and why has she not been in more films since I first saw her as a young woman in Broken Glass in the mid '80's? She has an elegant and almost regal down-to-earthiness, if those words can be juxtaposed, that comes across so effectively even when she is trying to be ""hard"", and she showed it full tilt in this truly fine film. She got a great role and just flat out ran with it and took all the others with her. A tour de force just as much as Annette Bening's Being Julia. It's probably way too early a film to get her Oscar consideration, but she is the best at it so far this year.

Joan was the real star, but Costner did a nice overall job even though his displays of anger weren't real convincing....he is just too ""laid back"" to be totally convincing when angry. He is just too nice of a guy to show anger well, and that hurts his acting delivery.

Overall, a real good modern family story well told, with convincing work from the daughters and the film's writer and director as ""Shep"" the radio producer. Yes, it was mainly a chick flick, but enough men exposed some ""issues"" in it for it to be very interesting to them also. And Joan, what's not to like for men about watching her? The camera work was first class in its color, angles and structure, and the Michigan suburban landscape in full green dress was real lush, with no pun intended for those who have already seen the film.

Kevin Costner plays a retired baseball player but this is not the cutie pie we remember from Field of Dreams or Bull Durham. Costner's character is a worn-out, self-loathing drunk until he finds a home away from home at the house of Joan Allen's character. Allen and Costner make a great on screen couple with comedic timing and genuine chemistry. Allen has 4 daughters in the movie who each contribute brilliantly to the building of the story. Keri Russell from 'Felicity' plays one of the daughters. You'll recognize the other 3 talented young ladies as well.

I found too much of the writing to be objectionable, though. The so called twist ending is nothing more than a cheap trick--it doesn't at all relate to the beginning of the film and calls the mental stability of Joan Allen's character into question. Why would any half-way reasonable person simply assume that an unexpectedly missing spouse had run off with his secretary? Why wouldn't she have called the police to report a missing person? Why wouldn't her daughters, or at least one of them, insist that she do so? It's not just a matter of not having included that--since this is a character-driven story, those questions simply must be addressed, in however a subtle or oblique fashion. Just what state was the marriage in before the husband's disappearance? Another thing: a man kicking down a locked door to yell at a woman, no matter how righteous he may feel about doing so, is not romantic--it's terrorizing. Then there are all the cheap and easy reversals concerning the daughters. The work wasn't done for them to have been achieved. It's just smarmy manipulation. Mike Binder is on his way to becoming the most overrated hack since Paul Thomas Anderson.

Permalink",True,"This movie contains some wonderful acting by Kevin Costner and especially by Joan Allen. Many scenes felt so genuine that they made me uncomfortable. However the ending of the movie angered me, and cheapened the emotion that I had invested in the movie for the past 2 hours. If we are to believe in the ""upside"" of Joan Allen's anger (allowing her to recover so quickly without being wrecked by guilt), we must believe that she is a cold and heartless person. And that is not how she is portrayed in the movie. Otherwise, the movie needs to be lengthened by about 30 minutes, showing how she came to terms with what has happened. She must forgive herself and the viewer must forgive her.

To add insult to injury, the funeral at the beginning of the movie cast a shadow that played with my emotions in painful scenes that followed. It led me to believe that the daughter might die of cancer, underscored by the overwhelmingly painful scene when Joan Allen tells her other daughters about their sister's hospitalization. I can see no purpose for the funeral at the beginning: it was a just a cheap shot.

I completely agree with A.O. Scott of the NY times, who called the ending of this movie ""a catastrophe"".

It is not easy watching movies about a family's love, loss and pain. It is especially difficult (as a parent) watching children get seriously ill. I am willing to make this investment, if the film-maker shows respect in return. Mike Binder (the writer-director) did not do this, and he also didn't deserve to waste the enormous talents of Joan Allen.

I can see other people have sparked to it, so all I can think of is that this is the status of movies these days and what our level of expectation has dropped to.

Binder clearly wants to emulate James L. Brooks' work (specifically ""Terms of Edearment"") but has nowhere near the chops for it. Brooks is an expert emotion manipulator, knowing exactly when to make you laugh and cry and the delicate balance between the two. God love Binder for trying, but he hit the wall with this mess.

I can see how the movie got made because it gave an opportunity for Kevin Costner and Joan Allen a chance to strut their stuff. But this film is an excellent example that even great actors need a well written script and a director to know how to guide them.

I should probably be glowing over the film, knowing that if it does well at the box office, Hollywood executives will green light more dramas with challenging content. But hopefully they can do more films with real conflict and complex characters, rather than card board cut outs and clichés."

Additionally, the drinking that takes place is neither funny nor relevant, it's just plain sad. If Allen's character had been a part of most families, an intervention would have taken place a long time prior. There is also not enough reason to believe that the mother and and ex-baseball player would ""hook up"" - or enough historical reference to understand why he likes her. Simply saying that he's always had a thing for her doesn't qualify as to why he feels that way - even if it's just animal lust.

Permalink",True,"I heard this movie was pretty good, so when it made it to HBO, I was happy to watch. I also really like Joan Allen. I recently saw her in a movie called ""Off the Map"" and she was wonderful (great movie by the way--rent it if you want to get the taste of this unappealing Joan Allen character out of your mind).

Anyway, I started watching it and it held me for a while. It was nice to see Kevin Costner again and he was (unlike Joan Allen's character) really likable. But after a while I found her character almost assaultive in her behavior. She is behaving in the most abusive, self-pitying way imaginable and No One Seems to Notice! I mean Kevin still loves her, her daughters seem mildly annoyed, but no one (except Shep in the end) does much about it.

Ahh, the key. Shep. He is played by Mike Binder. And it turns out the film was written by him. The name and face seemed familiar. Oh yeah, he was that creepy guy who made that hideously misogynistic HBO series ""Mind of the Married Man."" If you never saw it, believe you me, it was almost frightening in its bizarre, childish, view of women. They were either Hot Babes or Gargoyles.

Then it started making sense -- why the Joan Allen character was so unattractive -- in the mind of Mike Binder this is how he sees all middle-aged women. He even has Shep make this speech about the reason he likes sleeping with younger women is because they're ""nice."" Oh that's the reason! I've always wondered.

This guy must of been told by his mommy that he was a ""bad little boy"" and has been creating art taking his anger out on women ever since.

It's all pretty cleverly disguised as a ""woman's film."" But really look at it -- this is some hurt middle-aged guy's revenge fantasy. And to top it all off, all the anger and virulent and obnoxious behavior on Joan Allen's part is all for nothing because the husband did NOT run off with the Swedish secretary, he fell in a hole in the backyard and died!! Ha ha ha ha. See all you unhappy angry middle-aged women out there, you may just be imagining your husband's ill treatment.

By the end of the movie I was slack-jawed with wonder that this thing ever got made. But I guess Mike Binder has his fans . . .

Permalink",True,"""The Upside of Anger"" is a pleasant surprise. One would think that a movie about a middle aged woman, bitter and boozed up up over the sudden disappearance of her cheating husband; and doing her best to raise her 4 adult daughters would scream ""chick flick"" and make for 2hrs of terribly unfunny male bashing.

Instead.. what we get is a remarkably honest and relate able performance by Joan Allen. Her Terry Wolfmeyer is quite a character indeed. Terry is mad. MAD, MAD, MAD! After her hubby all but abandons her and her family, Terry whiles away the days watching TV with a smoke in one hand and a drink in the other. She's sarcastic to everyone she comes in contact with and is pretty much fed up with the suburban ""American Dream"".

Enter neighbor Denny Davies, a ex baseball playing, pot smoking, beer guzzling radio talk show host - who after hearing about Terry's predicament- decides to become her new neighborly drinking buddy. He doesn't seem to mind Terry's moodiness and although she initially pushes him away- she tends to grow fond of his company.

Of course, the two grow closer and closer until you can only guess what's developing....but the movie ends with a slight twist that this reviewer was not to particularly fond with.

Ending aside however, the ""Upside of Anger"" is quite an entertaining and well acted piece of work. Having never, never, NEVER, been a Kevin Costner fan- this reviewer was immediately taken with his performance of Denny Davies. Costner shines in his supporting role fantastically. This is definitely some of his best work in years, if not ever. His strong presence helps ""The Upside of Anger"" become a movie that all audiences can thoroughly enjoy.

There's a lot more to ""The Upside of Anger"" than what I've just mentioned above. Interesting sub plots with Terry's daughters and one of Denny's co-workers helps the film come full circle.

Recommended!!

Permalink",True,"I've been waiting and waiting for this kind of film to come along, and thanks to Mike Binder it was a wonderful surprise. Well, thanks to Mike Binder, Joan Allen and the entire cast. The subject of anger would probably be way low on the list of potentially successful film topics, but Binder proves that if it is written, acted and shot well, it'll suck you right in. And that's where I want to be in a watching a movie. I don't want to be distracted by car chases and stuff blowing up (although there is a 'blowing up' scene--at the dinner table--that has to be one of the best scenes in movie history). In the DVD's special feature about the making of the film, Binder proves he knows a hell of a lot about human nature. He wanted to make a film about angry and hurt women, both young and old, without turning off male viewers. Kevin Costner's character was the answer to that challenge. I agree that this is probably Costner's best pure performance. I'm so glad I didn't know the 'surprise' ending ahead of time. SPOILER would have been the perfect word for that. I never looked at my watch, never really wanted to get to the end/beginning in a hurry. Binder told me a story, made me laugh, surprised me, made me think, and entertained me in the process. And after seeing many thousands of films over the past 50 years (it's my business and my hobby) I'm always waiting for that in a film. Thanks to everyone connected with ""The Upside of Anger"".

Permalink",False,"What a difference a day makes, just like in real life. This film covers a lot of emotional territory and does it better than I've seen in a very long time. And we see a lot of days that make a big difference. My hat's off to Mike Binder for writing a story that is full of vastly different, interesting, but true characters that somehow find a comfort zone with each other and for having them speak words the rest of us might only think. Joan Allen is amazing in the role of a woman caught in an intersection of life and not knowing which way to turn. She is angry, hurt, and doesn't really want to think about tomorrow. Allen could easily take to her bed but she has four daughters who each are on the brink of their own awakenings and the mix of their lives as a partial outlet for her anger keep her from going over the edge into the abyss of screaming meemies. We are informed that Allen's character was always so sweet until the current crisis, and that makes her ravings and temporarily-rude behavior believable and acceptable. We can surmise that her previously sweet personality and the sense of humor we glimpse from time to time are among the reasons she has such loving daughters now when she needs them. Allen's range of comedic and dramatic skills are like the facets of a diamond in this performance.

Kevin Costner has finally become a genuine actor in his role as a - yes, again - baseball player, though now retired. I've never been a big fan of his, but this movie made one of me. His is a complex portrait of aging male-ness. His acceptance of his lot in life, his honesty, and his desire to hold onto his integrity are all captured in the relaxed but confident way he meshes with Allen's family. A lot of reviews describe his character as an alcoholic, but I strongly disagree. He likes to cocktail to take the edge off, but he is never disgustingly drunk and there are many scenes showing him sober, rational, and not presenting drastic personality changes. His character is actually the man all single women over 40 are looking for and can never find: playful, assured, good looking in a mature way, boyish in other ways, financially secure with an interesting past, cognizant of the meaningful things in life, and not skirt-chasing 20 year olds. I wonder if Binder knows such a guy because he drew him with such sincerity. When Costner says a big chunk of his life is yet to come, that's what a home run 'sounds' like. I've never seen Costner so much in-the-skin of a role. It doesn't look like he's acting which is what acting is all about, isn't it?

Mike Binder took a chance casting himself in the role of the sleazy producer, but he's simply terrific. I believe he thought he knew best how to play this role because he wanted just the right amount of sleaze without too much ego and he nailed it. In most movies, his character would be the one we love to hate because it would have been written with a harder edge, but not here. I had sympathy for him because you could see the ""search for self-esteem"" and his total lack of awareness about how to actually achieve it written all over him.

The dialogue and the characters are intelligent and swept me into their world and though the financially affluent environment at first did not ring true, it ultimately was a relief not to have the lack of money thrown in as another driver for the story. A lot of movies in this genre tend to get hysterical by including every darn stinking piece of bad luck imaginable. In this story there is just enough going on and rich people, by the way, do have crises, too. The editing is nearly perfect giving us generous slices of the secondary characters' subplots to get things nicely rounded out but not gorge us with details and delay the main storyline. We learn enough to engage us in the rhythm of the main household. The musical score is in perfect pitch with the screen action and supports the film like a soft cushion of feeling. It's there at every turn, gently sliding into your consciousness to underline the plot. You will laugh, you will worry, you'll think you know something, and you'll be surprised over and over again...just like real life. And like real life, you'll end up with hope.

I vote Oscars all around: Allen (sets the bar this year!) and Costner (surprise!) for acting and Binder for best original screenplay...or, dare I say?, best picture. Talent and originality shine like the blazing sun in this flick. Note to Mike Binder: I dream that you have another story like this one in you. 9 out of 10."

Permalink",False,"Review of The Upside of Anger by Gloria W.

The Upside of Anger is the story of a woman (Joan Allen as Terry Wolfmeyer)facing the fact that her husband left without any explanation. It touches on her having to deal with bills and four teenage daughters in the only way she knows possible.

It is a brilliant comedic look at the interpersonal relationships not only between mothers and daughters but male and females. It is amazingly funny and beautifully written. I anticipated that everyone would spend the entire movie cursing each other out and delivering idle threats and that is not what I got. This movie is quite the charmer.

Kevin Costner is wonderful as Denny, an ex baseball hero turned drunk. The daughters (Erika Christensen ""Andy"", Keri Russell ""Emily"", Alicia Witt ""Hadley"" & Evan Rachel Woods ""Popeye"") are darling. They all add outstanding depth to this film and offer excellent portrayals of the dynamics between sisters and the clashes between mothers and daughters. The mother (Joan Allen) is just bad... in a good way.

This movie is riveting! engaging! & down right hilarious! You would never expect the twist! I know I sure didn't. This movie is a must see and a terrific addition to any DVD collection!"

Permalink",True,"I'd have to say that this is definitely my favorite movie of all time. Costner proved to me that he can still act...and all of the younger actors were wonderful. This movie was amazing to me because it reminded me of my life.An alcoholic mother struggling with her daughters' individuality and them breaking away from her. She discovers a ""friend"" in Denny...not much of a friend more of a drinking buddy. But through the hardship of her daughters growing up and her thinking her husband skipped out on her to Sweden with his secretary, she seeks what she needs from Denny. Denny is a great character...so fun loving and happy (and a drunk stoner).They eventually find romance in their convoluted situation...everyone does...from ""Popeye"" (the youngest daughter about 15 i think) to the mother and Denny. Just a wonderful film all around.

Permalink",False,"Terry Wolfmeyer gets angry and depressed when husband Grey runs away with his secretary and leaves her with their four daughters. She starts drinking heavily and spending time with alcoholic neighbor Denny, an ex-baseball star with lots of money and not much to do.

The four daughters Grumpy, Dancer, Slutty and Stoned accept the news of their father disappearance with nonchalance.

Among the movie's many problems: we never see the ""lovable and sweet"" Terry - as described by daughter Stoned - before Grey's disappearance. We just see her as an angry, unpleasant bitch and as such it is difficult to root for her.

In three years, neither Terry nor her daughters ever try to get in touch with Grey. I understand being angry, but some financial/administrative problems must have required Grey to be informed or consulted. If Terry did not want to talk to him – which proves how incredibly immature she is– one of the daughters could have tried.

Terry is showed to be a housewife and Grey's supposed to be going bust. Where did they get the money to finance their lavish lifestyle?

Not a word is being said about Grey's disappearing with only his wallet and not a single suitcase or any spare clothes. Under normal circumstances, if a member of your family would vanish from one day to the other - after jumping to whatever conclusion - one would probably start to get worried about total lack of contact, but not in this family. Maybe hire a PI? Not the Wolfmeyer....

The thin main plot is padded by secondary plots about each of the daughters: Grumpy gets married and pregnant (not in this order), Dancer is sick, Slutty sleeps with her older boss and Stoned gets stoned with a gay guy. Being so busy with their social activities they never exchange ideas about what might have happened to dad.

The story wraps up a bit like the virgin suicides in reverse, which proves that bad girls have more fun and good girls top themselves."

Permalink",False,"Gone are the Dances With Wolves days when Kevin Costner plays a man's man. Now, he's stuck in EWF roles: Every Woman's Fantasy. Which has an ""upside"". Pun intended.

In The Upside of Anger, Joan Allen's husband takes up with a younger woman, leaving her to take care of their four teenage daughters. There's no way to inject any more estrogen into this movie than there already is. Enter Kevin Costner. Because in a man-hating, man-bashing world, there's only one man who can step up to the feminine plate and win Joan's heart.

If you're a man-hating man-basher who secretly really just wants a man to step into your life and fix your heart, you'll absolutely love this movie. I actually like men, so when I see them criticized, stereotyped, and set in a lower species than women, I cringe a little. I didn't like this movie, even though Costner's as cute and charming as he always is.

To me, it's just not realistic that an athletic, intelligent, door-breaking, hormone-charged, handsome, funny, charming, well-adjusted man would be hopelessly single and would willingly step into an embittered, riddled-with-problems woman's life and genuinely care for her four daughters. But if you liked Costner's other EWF movies, like Message in a Bottle and The Bodyguard, add this one to your collection!"

Permalink",True,"******************* SPOILERS *******************

This is basically American Beauty 2.0. The gay dude, the unnecessary violence (except in this case it is real), the girl hooking with the older man....

This is basically intended for mom's in their 50s who have very little taste for movies. This is story is not worthy of an adaptation, and even more disturbing is what are Allen and Costner doing in this picture.

So Costner plays a mediocre plagiarism version of loser Crash Davis, same coat, same baseball player, same attitude in the beginning. Not exactly a well thought out script.

Then, this story talks about nothing: it goes back into a flashback, with very little information on what is supposed to be the plot, but it turns out it talks about nothing, only a few sequences of sub plots that have no relation, it's very disorganized, way too tacky and cliché.

I'm very disappointed in the outcome: so in the end, did he cheated ? Or did he just got trapped in the well ? What happened all that time ? And we don't even get an explanation, just that, that's where the father ex-husband was for x amount of time. I don't get it, it was the whole point of the movie, cheater abandons his family and there goes the drama: instead, it denies it.

It's bland, skimpy, no intrigue, no character worth cheering for.

All right, there are good lines on it, Joan Allen have some moments of perfect acting, Kevin Costner also deserves his share of applause and the girls are all very cute (I'd even say a tad too much cute for a regular bunch of young people, even if they belong to a well-to-do Detroit suburban milieu). But the thing that one cannot accept is the series of incoherences in the screenplay. The final twist could lead to an interesting finale had it been more elaborate. The picture suffers also from a lack of forensic expertise: someone should have informed Mr. Binder that corpses of grown-up men smell VERY badly after some days in an open pit,

Permalink",True,"This movie reminded me of what Henry Ford allegedly said about history: ""just one damn thing after another."" We start with Terry Wolfmeyer, a bedraggled middle-aged woman who is depressed, distraught and furious because her husband has suddenly disappeared, leaving her alone to raise their four teen- to twenty-something daughters. As mom sinks into bitchiness and alcoholism, she inexplicably attracts the attentions of Denny Davies, a Budweiser addict and demoralized retired baseball star who lives nearby. Despite the dominant need to develop these two difficult characters, the film blurs its focus vainly trying as well to develop the character of each of the four daughters. As a result, none of the characters are adequately developed, leaving them lurching inexplicably through a one-damn-thing-after-another plot toward an incoherent denouement. At the end, the movie is never clear about what the upside of anger is supposed to be--even though one of the characters expressly tries to explain it.

Despite the weak plot, Joan Allen is effective and Kevin Costner manages to make an implausible character almost believable. But nothing can save a film with a story line like this one.

I was very surprised that Mike Binder was able to find financial backing for such an unoriginal story and screenplay. I wish I could mention at least one good quality about this film, but I cannot think of such. Erika Christenson, who plays one of the daughters, was beautiful as always, but failed to really ""gell"" with the other actors. Binder's portrayal of Costner's radio boss was very ""wooden"" and is the stuff of amateur drama 101.

Permalink",True,"It's debatable whether Kevin Costner can act, but this is a good story anyway. It's a quirky title for a film about a middle aged woman with 4 daughters whose husband leaves one day and never returns. She was ""The sweetest woman in the world"" explains her youngest daughter who helps us understand the story while she tries to understand anger herself via her school video project. Mom assumes her husband has abandoned her and the girls to go with his Swedish office assistant who had coincidentally quit her job and returned to Sweden. She responds to the crisis with seething anger which she numbs with generous amounts of Grey Goose Vodka. ""I closed the credit cards, the bank accounts, he will do it without our money,"" she explains to Costner. He is their neighbor who shows up one morning (beer in hand) to continue a discussion on a proposed housing development in their adjoining property. He enjoys a beer for breakfast and seeing her at 10am in her nightgown drinking vodka suggests he may have found a drinking buddy. It puts the ""FUN"" back in ""dysFUNctional.""

All of her girls may not share the same opinion about mom as their little sister, but they are all intelligent, beautiful and goal oriented. Somebody must have been doing something right before dad left. They have a beautiful home, an ideal life by most standards, so what happened? This is a good film in spite of some moments of poor dialog, and Kevin's ""acting."" I enjoyed it and think you will too.

The film has interesting characters and despite their flaws they are likable characters and we start to care about them and want to see what will happen to them by the end of the movie and if things will work out for them or not.

Permalink",True,"The Upside of Anger contains some of the career highlights of many actors, including Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. Joan Allen plays a woman with four daughters whose husband has left her. Costner is Allen's next door neighbor who falls in love with her. the movie covers the relationship with them and the relationships of the four daughters,who are very well cast. The Upside of Anger is about learning to live again after changes in life. Director Mike Bender does a really good job of writing and directing this film. The film's only flaw is Bender's own character in the movie as Costner's producer on the radio. He comes across as someone who we can't entirely love or hate. He is supposed to be a sleazy guy because he dates younger women and dates one of Allen's daughters, but since the character seems sincere in his affections for her, I couldn't get myself to completely hate him. He dates younger women, so what? The attitude the other characters have toward this character actually upsets the balance of the movie, which is supposed to be about how anger is self destructive in the long term. Maybe the character was ill used or should have been cut from the film entirely. Otherwise, this movie is worth a rental and maybe better than some other films that have been out recently. 7/10

We are given no reason why Gray would leave Terryand did she ever once file a missing persons report? Didn't any of his co-workers want to know what happened to him? And why wouldn't those girls hop on a computer and try to locate their father? Then there's the mystery dog seen licking the chicken at the beginning of the movieAny golden retriever I know would go nuts with the smell of a dead body in the back yard And how did Gray go out to walk the property without taking the dog? But the dog disappeared they same way Gray did. And the four actresses that played the daughters? Did they all have a different father? Maybe it was just a case of really crummy editing, because the years jumped by with no reference to the time other than in one scene, it's is snowing to beat the band and in the next minute, It is already fall! I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but I just couldn't get passed the fact that Terry went from a happy, nice, sweet woman, one that WE never got to see, to a hard, caustic, nasty creature who never tried to find her husband or deal with his disappearance other than through multiple bottles of Gray Goose. I am not sure who needed this lame flick as a ""Vehicle"" but Joan Allen is a better actress that needing to portray a hard, cold bitter woman with no apparent reason to pull out of it.

Permalink",False,"A strong family drama centered around a mother of four daughters coping with the sudden loss of her husband to a supposed affair. Joan Allen is magnificent as the mother trying to keep things together while her daughters are constantly making in her mind, unpopular choices. Allen is drunk throughout most of the first half of the film and watching her bitch and moan at her daughter was frankly not a lot of fun. She meets her neighbor Denny (Kevin Kostner), an ex-ball player who is at a crossroads in his career as he struggles to find any meaning in his life. The two need each other and do hook up. Their relationship is very similar to the Jack Nicholson/Shirley McClaine roles from ""Terms of Endearment"". There are a few similarities between the two films.

The movie plays out like reading a good novel. There really isn't a whole lot of story. It's about a family coping with choices and the realization that they need each other more than ever. All the performances are good. This is Kostner's best role in eons. he plays it just right, as do all four daughters, including Keri Russell (Felicity) as the daughter with an actual dream maybe too big for even her to cope with.

The star of the show is Allen. She is so natural in this role. She plays a lot of cold hearted bitches, but not like this one. She seems to hit all the right notes as she changes her emotions quickly and often.

This movie isn't all fluffy and joyful, but it's pretty real and I liked getting to know them. (***1/2)"

Costner knows his limitations, and he knows his Oscar days were a flash in the pan, so he's taken a role here that he knows is reliable, and at the same time is just different enough that it will seem less like a 'safe' role (erm...no pun intended) and more like a genius role.

And he pulls it off. Ignoring For the Love of the Game, which I shouldn't have even mentioned, this film is the true end to the 'trilogy' (or triple-play, as it may be), finally following up on Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. Costner pulls it off beautifully, and it doesn't hurt that Joan Allen is on top of her game, as well. Looking a bit too gaunt for my liking, Allen was still sharp as an angry axe, and her expressiveness...her control over the expressions on her face...simply masterful. The strained relationship between Allen and her daughters, and the moments where you just want to smack Allen just as her daughter exclaims (I nearly cheered during the 'door-kicking' scene), are surpassed by the understanding of the hamster running around inside her head and recognition of the need for every character in this film to overcome the limitations they've each set for themselves. Especially when you find out just how misplaced all of the anger and hostility is.

So what do we have here? Very sharp dialogue, a quirky story that rotates cleanly between gut-busting hilarity and tear-jerking sentimentality, and through it all you can't help but feel that this film is a winner! Sure, there are flawed moments, and the film could certainly have been trimmed here and there, but it doesn't drag and it's definitely a pleasure to watch. Allen and Costner shine so brightly in this one, that the rest of the cast - who are quite good - just don't matter much. They're 'window-dressing', as I've heard them called, but without the window dressing, potential customers will simply walk by. This is the Costner/Allen show, but their support is outstanding.

And the afore-mentioned flaws? One inherent problem within this film is the attempt to explain the film and its emotions - through the weak bookend narration, the ballet scene, Costner and Allen giggling like schoolgirls during their first 'sex' scene. These are contrasted by moments of extreme poignancy, wicked humour and sharp dialogue. Not as deep or meaningful as some other films, but much deeper than it's given credit for in this review.

This is probably the second-best film I've seen so far this year, behind only Hotel Rwanda. It was Costner's best role since Field of Dreams, and reminds me why Costner still gets roles and money to make films, even after the string of disasters and poor choices. I recommend it - take the chance, you won't regret it. 8/10."

Permalink",False,"I saw this movie not really knowing much about it except that Joan Allen was in it and I like her a lot, I was not prepared for how good the whole movie was and she surpassed her other great roles even more in this. I think what I liked most about the Mike Binder's style was that conversations were often not finished, in other words, unlike other movies where every conversation needs to come to a conclusion or better understanding, he left them for the audience to sort out, as in real life conversations, there are often no conclusions, it was an interesting way of engaging the audience. The Kevin Costner character was just great, and honestly, he redeemed himself in my eyes as I have not always liked his acting, he really played the ""Denny"" character well, the chemistry between him and Joan Allen and each one of the daughters was so well expressed through every incident, that you felt as if you were in the room with them. I think this is best a director can do for the audience, making a seamless connection between the characters and audience. The story is of course in of itself, a story many of us experience, the breaking up of family and the consequent issues of that process. no character was bigger than the other, as much as the mom seemed the be the center of the story, really the daughters and the boyfriend made their profound contributions to the story. All in all, I came away feeling good and most importantly having learned a lesson, which for me is what made this movie so so good."

Permalink",True,"I will grant that Kevin Costner and Joan Allen did a great acting job. So did the lovely young ladies who played the daughters, including the ones nearly 30 who managed to look like they are still late teens / early 20s.

But then I got to thinking about it and it dawned on me that this movie is just a poster child, so to speak, of a lot of the stuff that is just flat wrong in society these days. And Hollywood just passes it off as being perfectly normal.

Drug abuse.

Alcohol abuse.

Indiscrimate sex. And pedophilia to boot.

The (almost mandatory these days) gender-challenged person who is portrayed as being quite normal, thank you.

And the blatant disrespect shown by the girls to their mother is just jawdropping. If my sister, at that age, had talked to my mother the way these girls are portrayed talking to theirs, her life as she knew it would have ended on the spot. My mother would have been all over her like white on rice.

I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 0 because of the strength of Costner/Allen's roles. But overall, it sucked badly. I'm sorry I spent the money on it, and I'm depressed after watching it.

Speaking of train wrecks that brings to mind the plot. This is yet another of those endless Hollywood jobs where everyone is the victim.

Permalink",True,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Among some of the stupidest movie moments I've ever witnessed (in no particular order):

1) ""I'm g ay."" ""Have you ever had g ay s ex? You need to have s ex with a woman before you can know for sure."" Its hard to get a feel for how terrible and out of place this scene is without actually seeing it. And they are smoking pot as well. OK?

2) Daughter gets deathly ill. Not from cancer (""thank God its not cancer""), not from an eating disorder, but from ""stress.""

3) Youngest daughter's 3 terrible monologues coupled with stupid ""movie"" she was making on her laptop. Her entire role in the film seemed to be to give this stupid monologues and have the pot-smoking/g ay s ex scene mentioned above.

4) Daughter gets pregnant and we never even SEE the baby, yet we get to find out when she's pregnant again. Another poster made a good point that she manages to drink vodka while pregnant without anyone taking note. OK???

5) Daughter chooses not to go to college (way to stand up for yourself!). Later we get to hear about said daughters s ex with weird work guy (why?)

6) Daughter chooses to go to college and Mom gets all mad because its not the ""right"" college.

7) Mom gets all mad for no reason repeatedly throughout the movie.

8) Denny kicks down a door. I don't even know what else to say about this part.

9) THE ENDING. The father has been DEAD in the BACKYARD this whole time. How? Heck if I know. ""He must have fallen through that old watering hole"" is the only explanation we get.

I'm sure there are more that I've managed to miss. If I have, please post them.

I have made this post in the hopes of saving people who haven't seen this movie 2 hours (yes, its long) of their lives. Seriously, do yourself a favor and just rent the Incredibles, even if you've already seen it three times. I sure wish I had. Jack

Permalink",False,"I watched a preview show of this movie last night in a packed theater in Philadelphia. The audience, like me, really responded to the film --we laughed when we were supposed to laugh and were moved when we were supposed to be moved. Joan Allen is terrific as the matriarch coping with the disappearance of her husband (presumed to have run off with his secretary to Sweden). Kevin Costner, who I loved for years but have not enjoyed lately, is quite watchable as her smitten neighbor, who becomes a drinking buddy and then so much more. Superb performances also by several lovely young actresses as the daughters: Erika Christensen (Traffic, Swim Fan), Keri Russell (Felicity), Alicia Witt (Two Weeks Notice), and Evan Rachel Wood (thirteen). An intelligent dramedy, written and directed by Mike Binder, probably best known for the short-lived HBO series ""Mind of the Married Man"" and who appears in this film in a small but important role as Costner's friend and radio-show producer. This qualifies as a movie for grown-ups, thoughtful and enjoyable, it sticks with you after you leave the theater, in the best possible way. Early spring is often a dumping ground for movies whose success is in doubt. Reward this high quality film and go see it in theaters."

Joan Allen is hilarious, convincing as an angry woman who has been scorned, and should be nominated for best actress for this movie. Some of her looks are so intense you even get scared of her. It makes me grateful that my mother was never this mean. Kevin Costner is very lovable as a retired baseball player searching for meaning in his life. The philosophical meaning of this movie is that anger blinds you to the truth in your life. You will find yourself laughing, and you might even cry. I highly recommend that you go out and see this movie, which I have re-titled (in homage to another movie out at this time) ""The Diary of a mad WHITE woman"".

UPSIDE OF ANGER benefits from splendid performances - including one by the director who plays a sleazy radio producer, but there is some sloppiness. Why does the family have a dog in an early scene who never appears again? And it takes a long time for us to learn that the four young women are sisters.

Kevin Costner is a good comic actor, who does well with the character's alcoholism; Joan Allen is a splendid dramatic actress. I'm not sure I quite believed them as a couple.

Permalink",True,"In ""The Upside of Anger,"" Joan Allen plays Terry Wolfmeyer, a recently broken-hearted, present-time lush whose husband has suddenly run off, as far as Terry can fathom, and we are led to believe, to Sweden with his Swedish secretary. In his absence, and her partial absence due to a taxing boozing schedule that begins post-morning shower, Terry's left to parent their (4) daughters, who range from a high school senior to a 8th grader who serves, intermittently, as the narrator to the story. Regarding Mr. & Mrs. Wolfmeyer one gets the idea that things between them were coming, or were already, apart. But, one is never given enough information to substantiate that belief one way or another.

However, Terry's mind is set: she was dropped for another woman by her s**tbag husband--and that's that. Onto the boozing, self-annihilation and attempts to put things back to together for the sake of the future. Lukcy for Terry a compatriot booze-hound and concerned suburbanite happens to live next door in the form of Denny Davies (a doughy and amusing Kevin Costner), an ex-Detroit Tiger pitching star who earns a modest living as a Detroit DJ and by hocking his signature for cash at every opportunity.

We learn in a subsequent meeting between the two shortly after the husband's disappearance, that Denny has had his eyes on Terry, albeit from a respectable, and respective, distant. In short time he makes it readily known that he will be there for Terry to play him as needed; fellow single adult, bartender, surrogate father figure for the daughters, bed buddy.

Terry's never totally repulsed by the offering, soused as she is and never quite sure of anything in such a state. Denny, always with drinks in hand, presses the issue, never using his growing friendship with Terry's daughters as leverage. Eventually he and Terry score each other.

Terry's daughters never approve or disapprove, perhaps intimidated by Denny's celebrity, quite possibly because of their being accustomed to having (wanting?) a man in the house. However, their diffidence might also come from their unspoken hope that, with Denny around, they won't be left to deal with their mom alone. Though it is readily apparent that each daughter loves Terry in their own way, each is also suspect, maybe even scared of their mom, especially while she resides in her current state of unstable liquidity.

Allen is fun to watch, appearing, as she does, an acid-tongued comedienne dishing out one-liners and comebacks to a semi-appreciative audience. Costner's believable as the ex-jock who isn't as course as you'd expect him to be, save for the ubiquitous bottle of Bud always in his hand. Mike Binder (""The Mind of A Married Man""), who wrote and directed the movie, plays Adam ""Shep"" Goodman, Denny's 40-something, sleaze ball radio show producer.

Scenes with Terry and Shep crackle, especially after he begins to date, and screw, one of Terry's teenage daughters. In a very funny albeit it poignant exchange, Shep delivers a heart-punch to Terry's soul after she corners him for the purpose of asking why an older fella like him prefers dating girls half his age.

""Because,"" Shep says, gathering courage. ""They're not like you.""

Terry stands still as a statue, stunned by Shep's trenchant observation. He embellishes his point briefly and then leaves Terry to sulk in the aftermath of his terse rebuke.

Of course, she's angry. But, the upside of her anger is that it produces heartfelt reactions from others through whose assessments of her character Terry learns valuable lessons.

As The Clash said, ""Anger is a power, if you know that you can use it.""

While Terry might not be familiar with the lyric, in the end, her use of anger leads to enlightenment, hers, and others.

The only redeeming aspect of the movie is the fact that WRIF and Arthur P. appeared in it, so the Detroit setting at least had some authenticity.

Permalink",False,"I've seen stupid endings in my life, yes, but this is too much. In this movie, after everybody discovered that Joan Allen's husband was actually dead in a well in the backyard of their lovely house for years (so, he never abandoned her or their daughters, friends and job, as she thought and she told to everybody)... what happened? Nothing. This crazy woman assumed that he left her and run away with another woman and never looked back, that he was a cheater and an evil man. She made everybody believed that, made his daughters suffer a lot and hate him, too, she was completely wrong, and you know, it's OK.

They put the poor guy in a coffin, then they sat together feeling finally in peace. So,according to this movie, if your husband vanishes suddenly and with no explanation or further phone calls, you could easily assume that he escaped with a younger woman and tell everybody that he is a complete monster.

If someone, just by accident, discover later that he actually had a terrible accident and he's dead, well, it's just the way it is. No remorse, no recriminations, no guilt. All your family is going to be perfectly well with your little mistake. Isn't that lovely?"

I enjoyed watching this movie until the whole thing collapsed upon itself. I don't understand how so many people enjoyed this movie since the last act of the film made no sense. So, at the beginning of the movie we hear that this lady was nice, but her husband ran off to Sweden with a Swedish secretary. Then she turned ""angry"" but ""angry"" in this film means ""alcoholic"". Anyway, plot holes: - Husband ""leaves"", wife has no job and 2-3 kids in college. Yet she lives well for 3 years with no money problems. - She hears her husband ran off with the secretary, but turns out at the end he is really dead behind the house. Where did the secretary go? - How did the husband supposedly run off with no money at all? Even to buy a airplane ticket? - One of the daughters is pregnant. Then, later she becomes pregnant again, yet we see no baby or mention of her having a baby - They find dead husbands wallet on his body at the bottom of the well he died. How did they get to the wallet? The police weren't even called yet... -Wife supposedly had been given number to call husband after he had left. He was DEAD

Thats just a few... how could people look past this and enjoy the movie?"

Permalink",True,"Oh, the director did. That explains it.

This film gets points for concept and cast, but the writing was AWFUL. Banal, unrealistic, awkwardly paced, plot holes the size of a Mack truck and character portrayals that made No Sense. I saw it on DVD and I kept having the urge to backtrack and say, what? What did that person say? Why? What was THAT about? How inappropriate! I must have missed something.

This does NOT mean that the dialog was at all INTERESTING. No, it was a hodgepodge of clichés; the clichés themselves, however, were bizarrely out of place. For example, at the very beginning of the film, Mom comes in to dinner and announces that Dad has left the family. ""Your father is a small man,"" she declares. ""I hope that doesn't mean his dick size,"" says one of the newly bereft daughters. I mean, huh? That's just NOT RIGHT. Not merely crude, or flip, or insouciant--it's just NOT what a teenage girl from a hitherto stable home SAYS in that situation. It's what a fatuous writer/director/actor who hasn't done his research THINKS she might say.

This film felt like it was a hundred years long, so untidily did it lurch toward its conclusion, but I still had to watch the first part of ""Creating the Upside of Anger"" in order to discover how on earth this piece of garbage got made. And the mystery was solved! The director wrote it, produced it, and acted in it, too! He plays, appropriately enough, a vulgar, foolish jerkwad. He even manages to miscast himself in the same way that Woody Allen has in years of late, pairing his character off with a gorgeous young woman who would not sleep with his real-life self in a million years, no matter how famous and wealthy he is.

I felt terribly sorry for the actors, given this mush to work with. Within their given parameters, they did a fine job. I just wish they'd hired a script editor with a clue.

Permalink",True,"A friend bought this DVD and loaned it to me with the proviso that if I understood the movie, I had to explain it to her because she was so bored she fell asleep while watching it. Not exactly a glowing recommendation. I watched the entire thing wanting very much to like it and to be able to explain it to my friend. I love Joan Allen and while not a Kevin Costner fan, I do think when he gets it right, he does so in a big way. I settled in determined that this would be a great film.

Boy was I wrong. The movie was dull, the plot lame, and the characters entirely unlikeable. The movie kicks off with a funeral and leads us back in time to wonder who died and why. Joan Allen plays an angry, rich, drunk Detroit hausfrau with four angry, rich daughters. Why so angry? Dad disappears one day and mom believes he took off with his Swedish secretary who has moved back to Sweden. Mom takes up with drunk next door neighbor/former baseball player, Denny played by Kevin Costner. The rest of the flick centers around mom being angry at dad, daughters being angry at mom, mom being angry at Denny, Denny being angry at his radio producer. Oy veyso much anger! One daughter is so angry she lands in the hospital terribly ill and mom has a meltdown that she might have cancer. Yet, mom never puts a call through to Sweden to tell dad, and everyone is totally okay with that. Dad also never shows up at his oldest daughter's wedding. The director never explains this. Dad's a schmuck who moved to Sweden. There's your explanation.

The final frames reveal that lo and behold, dad did not move to Sweden but fell in a well on his property and died. I thought this was an interesting twist that could have been used more brilliantly earlier in the film. It would have been more fascinating to have the anger be about mom jumping to conclusions and how a family copes with that type of guilt in addition to the death.

The director made everyone in this film act pathetic, whiny and superficial. I think dear old dad jumped in the well to get away from the house of shrews.

Permalink",False,"For the life of me I cannot understand why this movie was so widely admired. Yes, it's well acted -- playing an alcoholic, egocentric, destructive, hateful, selfish, manipulative witch is a challenge, and Joan Allen rises to the occasion magnificently.

And yes, Mike Binder deserves some credit for tackling a project in which the two main characters are not likable.

But, there has to be some correlation between what we see and what we're told we're seeing. Time and again we're told that Terry Wolf whatever is ""the sweetest person."" Well, even in emotional extremis, a sweet person will display some residue of sweetness. Something!!!! Not Terry. She never commits one generous act in the whole film. She becomes slightly less vile toward the end of the movie, because she's eased up on vodka some, but even then, everything is all about her.

Yes, her husband ran away. Yes, it's sad. But you know what? I would have run too, Swedish secretary or not. Anybody would.

For a film like this to work there has to be some point, some larger context about shared humanity, something!!! Here there's nothing, no larger lesson, not even a convincing view of realistic characters. Just rich spoiled people who can't get their way.

It's not impossible to make a film like this. Michelangelo Antonioni made a whole career about spoiled rich people being vacuous. And they were good movies. But the characters and the filmmaker had some greater level of self awareness that lent the action universality.

Not here. No how. No way."

Permalink",True,"There are not too many movies that I dislike as much as I did this one. Aside from the nastiness of the conversations throughout (which, I suppose, was the point of the movie - although there's no effort to establish life BEFORE the dad disappears, so there's no baseline of emotion to compare everyone's behavior to), the movie doesn't deal with the bombshell ending. I won't detail it, but the discovery at the end of the movie is something much larger than what everyone seems to be dealing with throughout. Being angry over an assumption is a plot that made some sense, but when the assumption turns out to be wrong - wow! - that needs to be addressed!. I could accept the anger of a Dad skipping out on his wife and family, but when you learn the truth, and that anger is proved to be misplaced - well, I think there's a whole other movie that should have been made at that point. But the darn thing just ended! It actually made me angry - and I don't see the upside of that!

The plot lacks a certain continuity, and begins abruptly in the midst of what we find is the first of Terry's many angry episodes, with no context to understand what might have precipitated this behaviour. The plot moves along at a standstill pace as the character Terry moves from one bitter moment to another, almost alienating her family, but not quite, and almost driving away the horny and equally drunk neighbour, but not quite.

Both Allen and Costner are annoying and tiring throughout the film. I had no compassion for either of them, and no desire to see either of them find happiness. With scene after scene of the same emotion and no real character revelations, I was left to fill in the hope or despair myself.

The daughters were infinitely more interesting than the lead characters, but their roles were too small to generate any real knowledge of their experience. I thought this was a real loss. Aside from some stupid, misplaced and totally random narration by the youngest and strangest daughter, there was no opportunity to get inside the heads of the girls. It might have saved this movie.

As it was, I only finished watching the movie to learn the answer to the mystery of the dad's whereabouts. That revelation fell flat as did the rest of the movie. Not really worth the loonies to rent."

Permalink",False,"This movie has no redeeming value at all. First off the acting was Mc Crappy i don't care what you say they completely bombed that portion. Any woman could do what she did in that film, which consisted of drinking and going rants saying ""no one listens to me"". OK wait where was the plot..oh yea there wasn't one. Oh and don't you love how Denny boy just randomly fell in love with her. For a movie with no plot you at least need character development. The ending completely buried the film in its own stupidity and then went on to crap on its headstone. Don't waste your life, this was an embarrassment to the independent film world.

Permalink",False,"Every so often, a movie or a book comes along which raises very serious questions: What was it that people in this country were so angry about when the Twin Towers went down? Why are people upset when a thing like Columbine happens? Why are we not thrilled about the murder rate, the infant mortality rate, the increasing possibility of lethal epidemics, terrorist use of WMD's on our soil, and general destruction of ordinary lives in this once allegedly great nation of ours? The movie, ""The Upside of Anger,"" may not be unique in that regard; it raises the same questions of any imaginative film, song, or novel about dysfunctional persons, with the same implications. Yet this movie does it at every turn, as if perhaps we are to accept these twisted creations, these characters, as ordinary people.

If there were such a family as the Wolfmeyers in my neighborhood and I knew about it, I would form a neighborhood association to burn them out. If I found that the entire neighborhood was populated with similarly perverted, corrupt idiots, I would join Al Qaeda. I would seek out anthrax on E-Bay. I would poison the water supply. ""A house divided against itself cannot stand,"" Lincoln said.

From the moment the movie started, I wondered how these lives had ever come to be connected prior to the action I was seeing. Was I supposed to believe the mother gave birth to those daughters? Was this family a fantasy of the writer-director Mike Binder? A house full of women divided against itself, come on in and seduce one or two? Just tell them you're from a broken home, you're gay, be a drunk, don't shave or bathe. Say their name on the radio. Tell them you're Abraham Lincoln, Hemingway. They put out. They let it out. What a group of women!

What a world! Flip off the neighbors as you speed through the streets where children are playing. Rant against your absent husband to his almost adult daughters, as if perhaps they never met their father. Did this couple ever really live together? Did they know each other? Who raised their daughters? Oh, wait, they are like a bunch of dogs: Just give birth and kind of hang around together for food and insults, growls and grins. A little moral undermining from those you ""love"" goes a long way to wrecking the emotional compass. What's next? Upside, The Next Generation. Maybe it could be a TV series. And the father image of the drunken retired baseball player, as if the almost adult daughters would take a shine to the drunk neighbor replacing their father like that, snap-of-the-fingers. Wait. I forgot: He's played by Kevin Costner. That explains it. What teen or post-teen daughter wouldn't be thrilled to have a flabby, alcoholic KC banging her drunken mom at the time of life when it's most important to bond with the opposite-sex parent in order to form a sense of healthy sexual relationships? Who needs common sense or a moral compass in this world anyway? Make money, have sex, marry and breed, and then go find your true self, leaving misery and children in your wake like animals leave scat and a snake leaves skin. Wake me when it's over.

I think you will enjoy this movie. I recommend it. It's a wonderful place to visit, if you like those lives, perhaps like people you know. But if you do like it, just be sure you check to see whether a mob is forming in front of your home, and don't drink the water."

Permalink",True,"A touching human dramedy starring Joan Allen as a woman whose husband leaves her suddenly. She has four daughters ranging from 15 to their early 20s, and in her emotional state she has real trouble dealing with them. Allen's loneliness  and alcoholism  attract a neighbor, played by Kevin Costner, a former baseball player who hosts a radio show but doesn't do much else. I think the film does really well most of the time, keeping away from clichés. It doesn't necessarily want us to sympathize completely with Allen's character. She's very often self-involved. I actually even hated her character on occasion. I never blamed the daughters when they acted against her, which they do often enough. And I love the sweet relationship that develops between Allen and Costner. I think the film makes several big mistakes. I don't like the wraparound sequence, which shows a handful of the characters traveling to a funeral. Later on, the script teases us with whose funeral it is, and it's distracting. There is also an annoying voice-over, provided by the youngest daughter (played by Thirteen's Evan Rachel Wood), that is completely unnecessary. How beautiful would it have been without that opening bit, and to have the film end with that sublime little scene at the picnic table, wordless? There is also a handful of scenes that are too over-the-top, most notably the one where Costner kicks in the bathroom door and the one where Wood's guy friend smashes through the window (his character was complete during his previous sequence, where his father belittles him and Costner defends him). And I think the one place where it went for the obvious and shouldn't. The director has a role for himself where he plays this scummy-looking guy in his mid-40s who starts dating Allen's 18 year-old daughter. But then there are some scenes later on where he seems to genuinely care for the girl. I liked that it went somewhere new with this, but then it reverts near the end, saying, oh, wait, he really was just a pervert. Sorry to subvert your expectations, audience! Small problems aside, this is very much worthwhile and one of the better films of 2005 so far.

Permalink",False,"""The Upside of Anger"" is all about a laid back retired baseball hero (Cosner) who becomes involved with a neighbor woman (Allen) who has a perpetual bad attitude because her husband has run off to Sweden with his secretary. The film is sweetened by the woman's four beautiful but disparate daughters who thicken the plot with their own growing pains and family semifunctionality. Though it's been a long road from Mike Binder's debut in the raunchy romp ""Hollywood Knights"" (one of my guilty pleasures which helped launch the careers of Michelle Pffiefer, Tony Danza, Roberft Whurl, Fran Drescher and others), he score's a hit as director, writer, and character actor with this enjoyable and insightful cross-genre (comedy/drama/romance) tale of a mature couple sorting through their midlife crises together. Not a blockbuster but a very pleasant little film with a twist at the end worthy of a DVD rental. (B)

Permalink",True,"Advertised as an adult romantic dramedy, I wasn't prepared for the forceful - and very real - ANGER in this film. That's not a criticism of the film (just the advertising). Once again we're reminded of Joan Allen's talent, but, just as importantly, we see how fine Kevin Costner can be in the right role.

It's rare to see a major release with significant star talent in such a dark and ""unlikeable"" film. Perhaps, that's why it was dumped into the no man's land of films by being released in March of all times (why not in the fall or winter for awards time?). And, Joan Allen's character, TERRY, is unlikeable - and defiantly so. The marvel of her performance is that she makes Terry compelling rather than simply repelling. Matched by the easy charm and patience of Costner's ex-ballplayer, DENNY DAVIS(McClain?). the leading pair keep the film watchable through its overlong 118 minutes.

Added to the lead couple are four daughters and Denny's producer at the radio station he has a show on (played by Writer/Director Mike Binder). Having four daughters doesn't add to the story as much as it lengthens and dilutes the impact of the prime storyline. We get mini sub-dramas about all four of the daughters. While all well-played, the subplots do drag on.

The film is certainly worth applauding for its adult drama, but Binder makes a couple of crucial mistakes along the way ---

SPOILER ALERT ---

First, by setting the film AFTER the Husband's disappearance, we NEVER see the ""unangry"" Terry. There's a line or two from the daughters proclaiming that their Mom wasn't always angry, but we don't buy it. The tension and fulsome enmity between Terry and the daughters (particularly two of them) could not possibly have begun the Day The Husband Disappeared. Resentment that deep could not have been born so quickly.

Second, the much remarked upon ""twist ending"". I have no major problem with the ending as poetic drama, but the logic of it does fail upon further review. Obviously, people do go missing. But here, we have a clear 'explanation' that could have been checked out. If Terry is explained away as being so angry she refused to investigate, then surely SOMEONE would have - Didn't he have Brothers, Sisters, Cousins? NO friends? And, we have four quite precocious and seemingly intelligent teenage to young adult daughters - we are to believe that not one of them took the initiative to check out what happened? Binder MIGHT have gotten past this by shrinking the time frame from the 3 years the story takes place in, to say, 6 months.

------------ END SPOILERS -------------------------------------------

Even with my reservations, this is a rare adult drama worth checking out. We may see it mentioned (and perhaps, re-released) during awards season.

Permalink",False,"Despite its awful title and a screenplay that occasionally takes a wrong turn, The Upside Of Anger is a consistently absorbing and entertaining depiction of one family's dysfunction in a present-day, fashionable Detroit suburb. Upper-middle class angst hasn't had such an impressive workout since Ordinary People and Terms of Endearment. And as with those two films, this new one is basically a well-dressed soap opera but the suds are put into brilliant motion by an impressive acting ensemble. Joan Allen, always a superb actress, outdoes herself here as Terry Wolfmeyer, an abandoned wife with four beautiful daughters who drowns her humiliation and rage with alcohol. Kevin Costner plays her next door neighbor, a retired baseball player whose good looks have turned to a paunchy but shabby attractiveness. Director-screenwriter Mike Binder (and actor: he is terrific as a sleazy Lothario pursuing one of Allen's daughters) sustains the tension in this romantic comedy-drama for most of its two hour running time. Even when the film's second hour slides into mawkishness and an unexpected late plot development nearly derails the picture, The Upside Of Anger manages to keep the audience hooked to what is happening on the screen. That is due in no small part to the wonderful chemistry between Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. Allen gives a ferocious performance, by turns funny, angry and sad. Costner has never been better. For once he seems to have let his guard down, giving a relaxed, warm and very funny performance as a man in search of love and companionship. For what it's worth, both actors deserve to be remembered at Oscar time next year. While the movie itself is a bit too facile and unconvincing to be considered a Best Picture nominee, it's assured pacing and technical know-how does indicate that Mike Binder is a director to watch for in the future. There is so much about The Upside of Anger that is first-rate."

Permalink",True,"Within the first ten minutes of this film, I was impressed by Allen and Costner's acting. They were able to create recognizable characters by saying and doing very little, within just a few minutes, and they stayed true to those characters throughout. They didn't scale any dramatic heights, but they never hit a false note. (Parenthetically, I am grateful that Costner was not required to do an accent.) I know these people: regular drinkers whose drinking causes no great disasters, just a series of smaller problems which are cumulatively just as disastrous as a wreck would be. These drinkers did not become stereotypes--maudlin drunks or wisecracking tipplers.

My only problem with this film (and it is a major problem) is the ending. As the film went along, I first thought there was to be no perfect resolution where all problems are solved. And that would have been fine, since life often does not have perfect resolutions. But I could have done without the last ten minutes of this film, where there is a surprise revelation followed by insight and healing. And to compound the damage of this quick solution is a final voice-over which wraps up everything neatly with an explication of the film's title. Had the beginning of the film been as gimmicky and contrived as the ending, I doubt I would have stayed for the end.

However, there are a couple of things for which I am grateful: I am SO happy a certain character's medical problem does not become terminal. And I am also extremely happy that one character's announcement that he is gay (which at first seems a put-on) is not later followed up by a retraction, or worse yet, a conversion.

The film was always interesting, often funny, often impressive, and I can recommend it for anyone who likes some thought content in the films they view.

Permalink",True,"During that show's regrettably brief run on HBO it was my second favorite program (after ""The Sopranos"") and I'm not a big fan of comedy in general. It was exhilarating to watch something that really seemed designed by and for adults--if I remember right, there were no kid characters in the show, or maybe I'm just editing them from my memory. What was truly amazing was a genuine male perspective on ""the battle between the sexes""--often self-deprecating, to be sure, but also non-apologetic. I had a hunch it would have a problem finding the right audience....

""The Upside of Anger"" is a kind of movie-length version of the TV show with Mike Binder playing a sleazier version of the TV character and a new cast, most of whom are women, so the male perspective is a bit watered down. (As everyone probably already knows, Joan Allen plays a woman with four daughters whose husband disappears and who stumbles into a relationship of sorts with an alcoholic former ballplayer played by Kevin Costner, who seems to be speaking in his own voice at one point when he says he's tired of baseball.) Fans of ""Married Man"" will doubtless crack at least several smiles as they recognize Mike Binder's creative flourishes e.g. a fantasy scene that recalls ""Scanners"" and semi-repetitive dialogue e.g. ""I'm coming over, I am"" or ""I think you're lying, I do"" and the use of quick dissolves to indicate time passing. Those unfamiliar with Mr. Binder's work may find themselves scratching their heads wondering how they're supposed to be reacting to the unfolding events. They may also be put off by the ending.

Definitely worth a look; I admit I had a free pass to see it, so I felt no ""pressure"" to enjoy it or not enjoy it. Would probably play just as well on video.

*****************SPOILER ABOUT THE ENDING****************** It's only a semi-spoiler because the movie opens with a funeral, although we don't learn whose until the end. It turns out that the supposedly deserting husband has been dead in a well in the woods the whole time, thus the ""anger"" of the title has been unwarranted. Others have questioned the logistics of this, but I just wanted to go on record that people can in fact go incommunicado; in Pennsylvania there was a man who lay dead inside his condo for several years; mail was shoved through the slot in his door, his power was cut off, his car was towed away, and his neighbors even jokingly referred to it as ""the dead guy's place."" But no one took it upon him- or herself to venture inside until eventually someone came to collect overdue condo fees. To paraphrase the line from ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" ""...and as he owed no one money, no one inquired after him...""

Permalink",True,"The Big Chill was this good. Grand Canyon was this good. Those aside, deep digging is necessary to find a film as real - as engrossing - as endearing about a challenged cluster of people. You'll be inclined to assign ""dysfunctional"" to this family. Don't. They are not. Each character is merely slogging through life, living out their chapter for their age-group - the best way each knows how - on the occasion of spousal/paternal abandonment.

This cast was masterfully assembled. Each character has an independent personality to which they are true. You'll be joining them on a roller-coaster ride through a 3-year slice of ""Wolfmeyer Family"" life.

The story is fresh. Unless you cheat and read spoilers, the ending will be hard to predict and be all the more satisfying because of the challenge. This is a date movie full of energy and life lessons. Motherhood doesn't GET any more REAL than this.

Allen and Costner sizzle with repartee, sack time and sometimes both at once. The four daughters climb their own hills as they deal with their run-a-way dad each in their own way.

And the Unexpected Upside: Watching Mike Binder - who coincidently wrote this gem and plays the most lovable-zany-eccentric since Kramer on Seinfeld. You'll want to love this guy  if only you could look beyond his habits, appearance, bedside manner and slant on life.

So what's the Upside of Anger? Seeing this film. 9 out of 10. There's a lot to like.

Permalink",False,"""The Upside of Anger"" is all about a dysfunctional family. That's probably not how it was intended. But, to anyone who comes from such a family, has had such experiences, or has studied or works in the field of counseling, this movie is dysfunctional family all the way. Of course, there may be some in denial, but for the rest - maybe 10 percent of the population, this film might prove interesting. Maybe even entertaining.

So, it's puzzling why this movie has had a moderate box office success and is liked by so many critics. If the latter were rating it mostly for acting, it's conceivable that it would be rated above a six. Joan Allen gives a first rate performance as Terry Ann Wolfmeyer. She's angry at just about everyone. Her absent husband is her excuse. She hits the bottle like an alkie, and behaves like one otherwise. In this film, she seems to take no responsibilities at all. Her daughters do the cooking and chores.

The girls have their problems, and their father's absence and mother's complete burnout doesn't give them anything to anchor on. They seem to be able to cope by leaning on one another. At least they are company in their mutual distress.

I don't know what the writers or filmmakers were thinking with the title. But if they meant it seriously to apply to this film, they forgot to include anything positive about Terry's anger. I couldn't find a single incidence of anger in this movie that had an upside or anything positive about it.

Anger is a natural emotion so it's real. But we need to harness our anger or we hurt with it. And anger always does far more harm than good - if there is any good at all. One can do something good after being angry. But that comes from compassion or empathy or reasoning. It's not an upside of the anger itself.

Kevin Costner's character is interesting, but only for his own story as a former pro baseball player and now radio show host. His place in the Wolfmeyer family just doesn't fit. It doesn't seem likely or real. In short order, he's sitting at their dinner table eating with their family. And soon sleeping with their mom. Apparently, the girls weren't close to their dad because except for a couple comments by Popeye that she didn't hate her dad, no one gets upset or thinks they should look for him. Instead, they take mom's word that he flew off to Sweden to be with his secretary.

The bit of narrative by one of the girls says that their mom hadn't always been this way. It was just recent - her anger. But she probably had been an alcoholic for many years. It's not her binge drinking seen at this time in the film that leads one to believe that. Rather, it's her behavior and thinking. It's what the alcohol does to her and how she acts and thinks with it. A couple of times she starts to call long distance for her husband's secretary, but then doesn't go through with the call.

A non-alcoholic, thinking, caring woman (for herself and family) would have found her husband in short order. First she would have checked with his office. At one point she says that he had told her the company was going to let him go. Well, she should have called to see if it happened and/or where he was. Then, not finding him, she would check to find out if he's charging anything on their accounts or writing checks. She hasn't checked or said anything about all his clothes and belongings still being at home.

And not one of her four adult daughters questions anything. They go along with mom. This is right out of a fairy tale book, because families with thinking members question and check and search and they to get to the bottom of a major problem like the father's absence - or sudden disappearance.

What this shows is a huge hole in this plot to begin with. It's there because they couldn't have made this film without it. It has to not make sense. In that way, people who haven't had dysfunctional families and experiences would believe it was this way. And, for those who have had, this is a happier, easy way around the problem of the absent dad. It's a denial that there's much of a problem at all.

It is surprising that a significant number of people today can watch and enjoy a film like this. During the Great Depression, Hollywood didn't make movies about the hard times, suffering, and people out of work and hungry. The very few films that touched on that did so very sensitively. Rather, the movie fare was musicals, and high society romances, and mysteries or crime films - anything to take the minds of the people off the hard times and to raise the public spirits.

This film strikes one as similar to people living in the depression watching a movie about their hardships. But the big difference must be over what they have. Many people then had no or little food, didn't have jobs, and couldn't pay bills. But the Wolfmeyer's in this movie seem to have enough money to live on quite comfortably. They even have a significant area of land to sell for a big profit.

The ending is the best part of this movie. How dumb they have all been. And what misery could have been avoided. Too bad it doesn't say that in words. But then, the makers didn't see any dysfunction beyond the anger. At least, they didn't let on to it."

Permalink",True,"The Upside of Anger (2005): Dir: Mike Binder / Cast: Joan Allen, Kevin Costner, Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, Alicia Witt: Excellent film about bitterness and the road to healing. Joan Allen plays the mother of four daughters who is bitter after her husband takes off with his secretary. Kevin Costner plays a radio DJ and former baseball star who lives nearby. Detailed screenplay on relationships while staying focused on central issues. One daughter is into gymnastics; another is engaged to be married; another discovers that her potential boyfriend is gay; and another lands a job on Costner's radio station where she becomes involved with a womanizer. Well directed by Mike Binder who also has a speaking part in the film. Joan Allen embodies her role with sarcasm mixed with alcohol with a great scene where she is to meet the parents of her daughter's fiancée. Costner is employing equal chemistry in one of his best performances. He seeks out a relationship with Allen in those hard core drinking evenings. Twist ending has Costner discover the real reasons for Allen's husband's absence. The daughters are well drawn but also add to the film's predictable subplots. They are played by Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, Evan Rachel Wood, and Alicia Witt and they are stunning. Bitter resentment is ugly but the message regards the calm after the storm. Score: 9 / 10

Permalink",True,"""The Upside Of Anger"" features the most creative stunt casting in film history: Keri Russel, Alicia Witt, Evan Rachel Wood & Erika Christensen are supposed to be sisters.

Wowsers! The girls look absolutely nothing alike, not even accidentally. They don't even look like four girls who would be FRIENDS nevermind sisters. But, hey, it's a movie... I can suspend my disbelief.

There's enough good things going on here to get past the family tree anyway... love it or hate it this is not a movie you've seen before. It's a completely original story about a recently abandoned wife who turns to drinking and a former baseball star to deal with her unhappiness and anger. Joan Allen is great here and so is Kevin Costner. Although I usually despise the man I must say his acting has finally come full-circle: he is completely unafraid to play fat, unappealing and oddball. He's no longer governed by some studio-controlled image of himself as Gary Cooper-esque leading man. He's ready to just Act, and let the chips fall where they may.

Erika Christensen steals the show here as Andy, gorgeous and luscious, with a perfect pair of breasts that can scarcely keep from leaping out of her low-cut tops and doing a tap dance on the table top. (She gives good mammary.) Keri Russel is great in an underdeveloped role and Evan Rachel Wood plays a girl with the inexplicable name of Popeye... no, I don't know why either.

The movie tends to veer from broad comedy to intense drama and then to realistic character study... it's these changes in tone that make it uneven and difficult to enjoy as a singular cohesive idea. The movie also loses points for its cartoonish score, in which plucked strings turn the proceedings goofy and nonsensical, when a dignified melody would have served more effectively.

It's not fantastic cinema, and at times it seems to be a cross between ""American Beauty"" & ""Uncle Buck,"" but ""The Upside Of Anger"" is an earnest character-driven movie that provides some nice quiet moments, some drama, and some genuine laughs. That's enough for me tonight.

This is such a film that explores the relationship we all have w/anger. Like another comment said, ""The Joan Allen show,"" that is totally correct. Kevin Costner is good here too, but only as a supporting role, which is a good thing at this point in his career. Please watch this film so that we shouldn't judge before we know all the facts. Many of us judge or get angry too easily because we don't know the whole story, I'm one of those people. Here's hoping this might change some people from getting too upset too easily.

Permalink",False,"And that's pretty sad as the movie was so full of potential and with such an able cast. The main problem was the script followed far too quickly by the direction. I got quickly engrossed in the story and liked the cast from the get-go but there were far too many plot-holes to distract me. One was the fact that the girls never ever made an attempt to get hold of their father. The odds are one of the four would have insisted, possibly two out of the four. This was their father who had supported them in a pretty lavish lifestyle and presumably got close to them. He walks out of their lives and they just accept that? First bang on the disbelief gong.

Joan Allen (Terry - the mother) started to grate very quickly in her role as the mother, a nasty alcoholic who berates all around her( and she looks disturbingly cadaverous also, does the woman weigh 60lbs soaking wet?). And what was that one fantasy scene where the head of a guest at her table explodes splattering blood all over her daughters? Nasty and unnecessary, did nothing for the plot.

Speaking of - it swung every which way from comedy to drama to fantasy and key scenes are completely missing. Where did the first grandchild go? What happened to the family dog? Alcoholism is treated far too lightly and a scene where Terry stops drinking is slid over, nothing in her character has grown or changed to warrant this complete turnaround.

And the corpse? We are expected to believe that the man covered the old well over with boards after he fell in? Right?

I liked the premise of rage infesting the whole family and the stoic, sturdy daughters carrying on with their lives but a far better movie lurked within and it is a shame that that one wasn't made.

Mike Binder, the director, has a wonderful role in Shep the leering, lecherous producer in a radio station. Brilliant. As is Kevin Costner as a has-been baseball player (but plot flaw, no other past - wives, girlfriends, children is mentioned. Cardboard plot device). To sum up ~ 10 out of 10 for the cast, 5 out of 10 for the script. 7 out of 10 for the whole."

Permalink",False,"While the story and particularly the supporting characters of ""Upside"" leave something to be desired, this film is a must-see for anyone wishing to experience actors at the absolute top of their game. Joan Allen is phenomenal, reminiscent of Katharine Hepburn in ""The Lion in Winter"" in terms of the seemingly unlimited layers she brings to her character.

As noted elsewhere, Kevin Costner is the surprise of the film -- totally believable in his character and also totally believable as the lover of this incredibly damaged woman.

The supporting characters, particularly the four daughters, are given virtually no room to explore or even explain what they're doing in the picture. We don't know what they're going through, what they're feeling, or why. They should have been cut from the film in order to focus on where we end up anyway (Allen's riveting performance and Costner's companion role) or brought somewhere near par.

Joan Allen is a revelation. See it!"

Permalink",False,"I felt quite 'female' while watching this movie. All these diverse characters, especially the women, with all their different points of view towards life and relationships, and the ups and downs of them... it's a nice tapestry that Binder wanted to design. But a film is not a TV drama series. Mike, you drew a sine curve pretty well, but you had to stop somewhere. And what a terrible twist did you bring out at the end in order to do that. That killed the whole atmosphere that I was beginning to enjoy, not thinking how it'll end.

'Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child' when it comes to understanding films. Why was I really liking this film? Is it because of its fantastic actresses? Perhaps so. Joan Allen brings about another magical work by which despite of all the character flaws, the audience begin to actually like Terry. Evan Rachel Wood, always a pleasure to watch, beautifully narrates the story and excellently plays a character that's otherwise badly written. Erica Christensen and Alicia Witt both reach the top of their capacity. As for Kevin Costner, I'm not sure why I liked his job here. Probably his too-casual approach I guess.

Perhaps, 'people don't know how to love.' I was actually supposed to love this film. Instead I ended up bashing it in the first paragraph. It's only because one major flaw of Mike Binder left a bad taste in my mouth."

The willing suspension of disbelief is the groundwork for the magic of all play and cinema expression. We're blessed by such a wonderful film as this.

Permalink",True,"Short and sweet: Joan Allen is brilliant in this movie, portraying an extremely unsympathetic character whose anger is based on a seriously untrue assumption, as we come to find out through the course of the events. A lot has been written about the ending, where we find out what really happened to Grey, the husband - how ridiculous it was, how unrealistic, etc. etc. I thought the ending made complete sense, given the psychological make-up of the characters, and the irony of the situation gave the film a much deeper context and you almost are forced to watch it again, given this new information. The movie did feel incomplete to me, it was hardly a satisfying experience overall, but in retrospect, that might have been intentional as well.

Permalink",False,"Joan Allen, as an alcoholic depressed wife whose husband supposedly walks out on her, sets the stage for ""The Upside of Anger.""

Whoever made Allen up for this film was thinking of performance as Pat Nixon. She looks remarkably like the former first lady that she portrayed some years back.

In the film, Allen has four daughters and soon becomes involved with her neighbor Kevin Costner. He is a drinker and a former baseball player on a radio talk show.

Allen is moody and acts the part to the hilt. One daughter, who graduates from college, tells her on graduation day that she is pregnant and getting married to the father. Allen and the others are invited to lunch by the prospective groom's father. Here, we get a tinge of mid-western anti-semitism by Allen's reaction-""You're not Jews,"" once she hears there is a Dave Jr. Besides the name, the family doesn't happen to be Jewish anyway.

As in ""Terms of Endearmnent,"" we have a near cancer scare when the older daughter is hospitalized with stomach pains which turns out to be caused by stress. What is going on in this film is enough to give anyone stress. That same daughter uses the 4 letter word to describe her mother, while another daughter works at the radio station, only to sleep around with the producer, a nice supporting acting performance by the film's director Mike Binder. The Allen character invariably has it out with the ""Shep"" (Binder) and slaps him across the face at the other daughter's wedding. Later, at a supermarket, Shep is ready to seduce Allen. At this point, I was thinking of Mrs. Robinson revisited.

The film starts off with a funeral before going the flash back route. All will begin to come together when a digging uncovers a family tragedy.

The picture deals with anger making us the people we are. Rather, we are products as well of such hostility."

Permalink",False,"It is understandable that any woman would go off the deep end after thinking that her husband ran off with his Swedish secretary back to her home country. Added on top of it being stuck in a house with four daughters with issues of there own and the only option for a rebound is a washed up ex-baseball player who refuses to talk baseball and enjoys his alcohol and other recreational drugs doesn't help.

Joan Allen breaks out of the supporting mom role to take the liquored-up lead of The Upside of Anger. As for the washed-up baseball player, that of course is played by Kevin Costner as he has some contract that states he always gets first crack at all baseball character. As for the daughters, they are played by the hot chick from Swimfan, the hot chick from Felicity, the formally hot chick from Urban Legend, and the hot chick from Green Day's Wake Me up When September Ends video who has officially taken over Christina Ricci's spot as the go-to indie teen.

The acting itself is as good as you would expect from the actor listed above except with four daughters to share screen time, none of them are able to shine as much as they have in past endeavors. Most wasted was Evan Rachel Wood as the laid back daughter who starts the film off as the narrator that goes away until the end of the film. In the middle she was stuck in a very predictable storyline, the most boring of the four, not too mention the unfortunate nickname Popeye, which was never explained unless I completely missed it. The other story lines do hold up better to the point that the poor plot twist at the end doesn't ruin the whole movie."

Permalink",True,"Overall this was a passably good romantic comedy/drama with some solid performances marred by a few problems in the flow of the film. As amply noted in other comments: Allen and Costner were outstanding, though Allen's character could be one truly unlikeable protagonist at times. My biggest problem with the film was the choice of foreshadowing by showing a funeral attended by Costner and Allen at the start of the film. I kept waiting to be socked in the gut with one of the daughters dying (or some other character?); this was intentionally done--you clearly are led to believe the sick daughter played by Russell will die. Because of this I never felt I could relax and enjoy the moments of levity. And the foreshadowing played no significant role in the outcome or plot, i.e. the husband's death could've been portrayed in the chronological sequence of the film, and still ended the film on the note of peace and positive feeling.

When I finished it, I thought it was quite good, not perfect, but good. It had a human element to it, and kind of reminded us of what it's like trying to raise a family under difficult conditions. Joan Allen plays a woman and a mother struggling with the fact her husband has left her and her children. She starts a relationship with a mischievous neighbor and retired pro baseball player, Denny (Kevin Costner). I thought Joan Allen's character was fairly negative but that is the premise of the movie; you get to appreciate her after a while. I also thought the movie was funny in some parts. The movie certainly wasn't without its faults, like the daughter (played by Erika Christensen) hooking up with that misfit older guy from the station-no chemistry between the two on screen and just not believable.Also, didn't really think the young daughter's strange gay male friend had any business being in this film. Maybe he was meant to lighten up the film a little bit, who knows. The ending was very well done I thought, and the youngest daughter narrating it at end was quite cute. 8 out of 10 stars."

Permalink",False,"Binder had not cast himself as the unbelievable seducer of the young and sexy Erika Christensen. I didn't buy it, found it a little sickening, in fact, and I suspect others agreed, and that might be the one thing that kept it from getting strong word of mouth. Binder says on the DVD that Woody Allen is his hero, and Woody, of course, often casts himself opposite beautiful love interests--which itself strikes many as unbelievable. Woody is so smart, though, and has such a unique charm and wit, that I can buy it with him. Not with Binder, who is no more Woody than Detroit is New York City. Still, Binder deserves credit for an otherwise excellent movie, one which may produce an Oscar nomination for Joan Allen. It also showcases some of the more interesting young actresses of the current time. Among the daughters, I thought Russell, rather than Wood, gave the best performance, but they were all good, as was Costner. Definitely worth seeing. *** possible spoiler*** I found Joan Allen's slap-down of Binder both hilarious and long overdue. Costner's eventual confrontation of Binder is ridiculously late, although I realize this was probably done to show the growth in his character. ***end of spoiler***"

Permalink",False,"There is a lot about this movie that is very good. The acting, especially by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner, is outstanding - they are real, drawing out a wide range of emotional responses to them as they go through their various states of craziness, frustration, and love. If one only focuses on the central relationships, the movie makes sense, and the mix of comedy and drama works well.

Where the movie slips up is the plot context. The idea is fine, but nothing makes the back story make sense. Too many questions get left unanswered - and those questions are not at all irrelevant. It's hard to get a really good grasp on what the upside of anger is for Allen's character when we never really get a sense of where she was at before the film's story begins.

Permalink",False,"Terry Wolfmeyer's (Joan Allen) husband has gone off with his secretary leaving her with four daughters, a lot of confusion and anger.

I can't make up my mind about this movie. It is watchable, the daughters are all babes, Costner as Denny Davis (a retired Baseball star, who has a sports talk radio show) is okay, but I think my problem is with Joan Allen. When she is angry I feel she is not angry enough. She is never happy for herself or anyone else. Her happy is just being less angry, and numbed with vodka.

The story has her fighting her daughters at almost every turn and when she tries to comfort them she does so in a condescending way. There is a little bit of her looking back at herself as she gets angry at her husband for leaving her in this mess; as she alienates her daughters; and as she comforts them; as she cannot decide what to do about Denny who is always around and no one is sure why. It's almost as though she knows there is a camera on her. Not good. In the beginning of the movie she reminded me of Lauren Becall, but that went away fast. Becall never let you know there was a camera in the room.

I felt the dialog suffered at times. It should have been more hard-hitting than it was. It walked on eggs most of the time. However, I will say the acting was good all around.

I also think there were too many daughters and it was hard to keep them straight as each one had too little to say in the first half. It was like each one was in and out and what did this one say, which daughter was that, and what is her story? So we learn more about the daughters as Terry directs more anger at them: at Hadley (Alicia Witt) who makes an announcement of marriage and her pregnancy; at Andy (Erika Christensen) for her decision not to go to college and work at the radio station getting involved with Denny's producer, Shep (Mike Binder, who also directed this movie); at Emily (Keri Russell) because she doesn't support Emily's decision to be a career dancer. Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood) gets away clean because she is ""just a kid""and not taken seriously. But Popeye does have a secret and is on a crusade to turn a gay boy straight.

I will say that as the movie went on I did become more comfortable with Terry and Denny as they became more comfortable with each other and put the sparring to rest. Terry stopped the drinking and Joan Allen seemed to forget there was a camera there. I did say it was watchable.

I was impressed with Mike Binder as Shep. At first I didn't like him and then I did when I realized he has a natural delivery that was compelling, and you watch him regardless of who he is in the scene with. That's compelling. A star is born?

So what is the upside to anger? Did Terry change for the better? You will have to judge for yourself. And, oh, yes, there is a twist at the end I never saw coming. Does this make everything that went before worth it? Hmmmmm."

Permalink",True,"Although at times a little melodramatic, and probably more of a drama than comedy - this movie succeeds with good character development and interaction. One of the better qualities of the film is that scenes with multiple actors work as well as scenes with one-on-one's. With strong leads from Allen and Costner and a quirky and at times insightful script, the movie has good pacing and pep. Didn't know the director was one of the main supporting cast, but he brings sort of a Ben Stiller-esquire persona without the slapstick or crudeness in support. The wedding scene with he and Allen was one of the better scenes in the movie, with character dialog cutting right into social stigmas of age.

Joan Allen really stands out in her misery, bluntness, and sometimes tactless behavior with her daughters. And the shared problems of middle-age and loneliness, often clichéd, are done with some sly humor - there is some cynicism here from the mom that is nicely balanced with adolescent antics of the Costner character - the bathroom scenes with Costner/Allen are a well written evolution, indicative of character growth. The growth of their relationship is entertaining and believable with some minor exceptions (like Costner kicking the door in).

The younger actresses give OK support - the more interesting being the younger 2, while the older 2 seem a little less dynamic in their roles, but not bad.

This is a recommended rental for anyone looking for a quirky sometimes insightful drama with a focus on great character interaction more than plot or story. Pretty good.

Permalink",False,"Rarely do I like the post-modern device of telegraphing the ending of a film at the beginning. It usually reeks of pretension, as if the filmmaker is saying, ""My film is so important, it doesn't need trivialities like suspense."" But done thoughtfully, the technique can build tension and draw in the viewer rather than alienate. This is the Case in The Upside of Anger, which leads off with a scene with the main characters on their way to a funeral. Director Mike Binder uses this to advantage, however, so that each scene is imbued with tension it otherwise would have lacked. Of course the ending will be the hook that draws most into conversation about this film. Is it manipulative? Does it fit? I argue not only does it fit, it gives you two films in one; the one you just saw and the one which you will replay in your mind given the ending. The film is not without flaws. In family films, as with actual families, sometimes one child is given less attention. In Upside, it's Keri Russell's character who almost seems to be from a different family altogether. This may be Binder's point, but by not amalgamating characters, he is forced to balance too many story lines, neglecting more interesting relationships. For example, Binder's character, ""Shep,"" is a gem in this picture and really has a unique point of view. The film seemed to be begging for a final scene between ""Shep"" and Joan Allen's character. The score is also weak, relying on clichéd cues to tell us whether a scene is comic or dramatic. The strength of this picture is that it defies labels  it is a drama with comic moments  and the music belies this. In any case, every single actor is exceptional  especially Costner and Allen's. Every time Costner seems to have slipped into parody, he delivers one of these sublime performances that remind you why he's a screen idol. And if Allen isn't nominated for awards aplenty for her work here, I suppose that would be the downside to The Upside of Anger."

Permalink",False,"This was a very surprising movie. The entire plot was solely character driven and very well structured. Each aspect of the main characters reflect a believable emotional role in a family; how a mother's reaction to a traumatic event shapes the behaviours of the daughters and boyfriend. The character progression is structured in that the consequences are numerous and unique to an individual but remain logical. You could watch the movie 50 times and still be able to point out parallels, both in the individual plots of the stars as well as visual cues. The cinematography is seamless and compliments the emotion of the scene and cinematic progression of the movie. Pleasantly and surprisingly funny at times, the humour is quality; good comedy, and not just for a drama. Also heartfelt throughout, the lives that this film chronicles leaves me believing that this may have happened and I can empathise wholly. In addition to being well structured, the coda of the movie is unpredictable, ending on a happy note; though its arrival was a surprise. It remains me of ""American Beauty"", though the latter I find to be superior; it is truth about the presentation of a family's emotional state.

The dialogue is almost never cheesy like in most films of this genre.

If you're a fan of melodrama watch this movie. Come to think of it if you're a fan of movie's watch this movie.

Permalink",False,"Starring Joan Allen (whom action fans will recognize as Sean Archer's wife) and Kevin Costner (I think I last saw him in Thirteen Days), this film tells the tale of relationships between an alcoholic mum and her 4 girls, when the man of the household apparently walked out on them to be in Sweden with his secretary.

And my, with 4 girls, it's eye candy galore - Keri Russell (Felicity anyone?), Erika Christensen (Swimfan), Evan Rachel Wood and Alicia Witt. This film takes its time to tell its tale of the bitterness felt by Allen when her husband left her. To manage this, she turns to the bottle, and naturally, things take their toil on inter-personal relationships.

With Russell, Allen compares the love she thought Russell had for her dad didn't measure up to the one Russell had for her. Allen imposes her will and desires on Russell, which bred contempt, and Russell thinks she isn't getting all the support she needs from her mom to pursue her dream of being a ballerina.

With Erika, Allen frowns upon her relationship with her manager ""Shep"", who is at least twice her age. It is hilarious watching Allen confronting ""Shep"", with the hard-hitting slaps, and her chancing upon her daughter having sex with him. Of mention is that ""Shep"" is also played by writer/director (of this film) Mike Binder (hmm... no prizes here) With her eldest child Witt, Allen gets frustrated when she's the last to know, during Witt's graduation, that she is pregnant and intends to get married. The scene with the in-laws is laced with so much tension, you'll just be hanging onto your seat for the outburst.

The youngest child, and the narrator of the story, had to grapple with falling in love with a gay teenager, who happens to also come from a broken home. The scene in which she tests his ""gayness"" and challenges / questions his sexual orientation is classic.

Where does Costner come into all this? As a has-been baseball player who now deejays at a local station, who introduced Erika to ""Shep"", who becomes a drink buddy with Allen, who develops a likable relationship with all the siblings - a surrogate father of sorts, and somehow seems to be able to take all the bitchiness that Allen exudes, and to almost always, diffuse tense situations.

There is a key theme running through all relationships, and that is to think before you shoot your mouth off. Sometimes sticks and stones may not hurt you, but words and misrepresented intentions often will.

It all comes to an end with a depressing revelation that makes you think, what if, and one in which makes all characters think through their current state of being, and to question, the upside of anger."

Permalink",False,"I read the critics' reviews so was alerted to an unexpected ending, was pleasantly surprised to find it fit. Costner stood out. Liked him very much in Tin Cup- an approachable guy with a hint of the hero.That element resurfaced in this film. He was believable and eminently appreciable as a solidifying and unifying character, sensing the drama within the family and adding himself as that unifying persona. Many subplots implied, ( i.e.: Costner & baseball, any one of the daughters, Shep, the family dynamics, the marriage) with not enough time to develop, but that was okay- this was a film to watch, to suspend issues about lifestyle, full explanations, tight connections;the story was too complex to be fully realized but was an opportunity to look at ""the big picture"" and simply enjoy the ride through yet another angst-ridden human existence. The purpose of Binder's character not clear to me, but not upsetting either- maybe I don't get it, yet, including the supermarket scene. Narration was not overdone, was helpful. Ballet scene a bit too long, distracting. Alcoholism used as a fact, not an ""issue"". The reaction of a wife left was completely recognizable, and the ending was yet another mirror held to our faces, not a neat wrap-up; I appreciated it. Marc Cohn's contribution was good."

Permalink",True,"Binder has done an amazing film. I get the problem some people have with the ending but I still like it even though I have to agree. I love the film. Hats off to Mike Binder. This is a good film for adults. It's funny and warm and truthful. Like Hannah and her sisters or Crimes and Misdemeanors. Costner is so good in this. He's a fine actor and this film showcases him and Erica Kristenson is a star to watch.

LOVED IT!!!!!!! I love Joan Allen as well and Evan Rachel Wood is a pleasure to watch.

Mike Binder is a good filmmaker. I will be in line for his next movie too. I know that this guy is going to have a long career. His work has a ring of truth to it. He deserves all of the great reviews he's getting for this.

Permalink",False,"Joan Allen is a mother of 4 daughters. And a lot of the movie is just about their relationship with each other. Kevin Costner comes in and befriends the mother...they are drinking buddies. The 'whole' of the movie is mostly about the mother growing and trying to understand her daughters and the life around her. It is very touching and heartfelt. It is humorous in all the right places. It is very real. You can identify with the characters, as if it was your own life, and you were apart of their family. It touches on real life issues and has a very positive spin. It was a great movie. I would pay almost any amount of money to see it.

Upside of Anger is one of those films that I could see again the next day. I will be buying it as soon as it's available on DVD. If this is not playing near you, I would recommend the drive.

Permalink",False,"If you don't like The Upside of Anger, it's probably because you haven't the experience that gives you the maturity and insight you need to understand what's going on in the film. Joan Allen is superlative as the spurned wife, coping poorly with being deserted for a younger woman. Kevin Costner is at his best as the neighbor who sets out to find a drinking buddy and ends up with a family. The true beauty of the film is that all of the characters contribute to the development of the story, and each brings a unique twist to what unfolds. Not since Magnolia have so many characters come together and come to matter so much to the viewer. The film is ripe with pathos without drifting into bathos; it draws you in without being maudlin, silly, or irrelevant. At the end you feel good without feeling manipulated.

Permalink",True,"The trailer sucks and does not do justice to the actual movie which is a wonderful experience.

Joan Allen is the most natural actor I think I've ever known, although the rest of this movies' cast did a great job too. This leads me to how delightfully and perfectly genuine this movie's story turned out to feel like not only through the entire presentation but the actors contributed tons to that aspect. I mean, it didn't even feel like I was watching a movie with actors playing roles, but more like watching real life happening in the neighbourhood or something. A part of this is in the general atmosphere which is very calm all through the movie but never gets boring, not ever but more like draws you in. Yet this doesn't lack interesting drama - it just doesn't come off as movie-ish as usually in movies.

Even so, I daresay even those who are more into action and adventure, may very well enjoy this. At least me and my brother who are fans of stuff like The Lord of the Rings, Sherlock Holmes and other such, we truly enjoyed this movie.

There a very graphic gory moment which is one of the humorous moments of the over-all pleasantly genuine humour in this movie. I bet gore is something you'd never expect to see in a movie of this genre, but they totally made it fit in. It suits the situation in which it happens by the how and why it happens. Even if yo're sensitive to gore, I daresay that scene will not bother you but rather amuse. I daresay this because even my other brother who is extremely sensitive to any violence in movies, was not bothered and found it funny regardless of how graphic it was. But of course we're all individuals, so be warned; there is a really gory moment that is likely to rather amuse but might disturb as well.

Now, personally they lost me at some point with the whole anger-philosophy one of the characters speaks in voice-overs. The beginning was easy to follow and understand but along the way and at the end I it got more complicated...but it hardly matters because the story itself already got its point through when it comes to anger. Especially through the ending twist which you kind of saw coming but not really. I bet no one could guess the rather shocking revelation of the full picture. Here I must warn, that the final truth of the story is somewhat depressing, maybe even slightly disturbing for the most sensitive of people. But again, that twist adds to the genuine-life feel and power of this movie, and makes this the memorable and important piece that this is.

I warmly recommend this to anyone, no matter what your preferred movie genre is. You're going to miss a lot if you don't watch this movie.

Permalink",False,"The Upside of Anger is a wonderful film about the struggles of anger. It's dark comedic touch grabs you from the start without releasing you until the credits roll. The script is funny, charming, well-written dialogue; just absolutely lovely. The direction is dead-on. The director makes you feel like you want to be in this environment that, let's face it isn't the most optimistic. The highlight here is the lead performance from Joan Allen. She's magical here.How the Academy can sleep at night knowing they didn't nominate her is just beyond comprehension. Kevin Costner gives his best performance to date here, as well. The entire ensemble works with one-another, and it shows.

This is a smaller film, so many people haven't heard of it, but I beg you to see it; 10.

Permalink",False,"There are only a handful of actresses out there right now who can completely command a screen to the point that I will see anything they do and three-time Oscar nominee Joan Allen is definitely one of them and it is her dazzling performance which is the main selling point of THE UPSIDE OF ANGER,an intelligent and offbeat comedy-drama which stars Allen as Terry Wolfmeyer, a highly strung but domineering wife and mother who goes into an emotional meltdown when she believes her husband has run off with his secretary. She lashes out at everyone, with her four daughters taking the brunt of her abuse, while tentatively broaching a relationship with a retired baseball player (Kevin Costner). Allen turns in a gutsy and mesmerizing performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination and her chemistry with Costner is surprisingly smooth. Alicia Witt, Erika Christiansen, Kerry Russell,and Evan Rachel Wood play Terry's daughters, who all have their own issues with Mom. Director and screenwriter Mike Binder has not only fashioned a moving and human story with flawed and vivid characters but written a juicy role for himself as Christiansen's boss, who she falls for, much to Mom's chagrin. It's easy to get caught up in the emotional story, but it is the blockbuster star turn by the fabulous Joan Allen that makes this one a keeper."

Permalink",True,"To begin with: fair play to Mike Binder. Trick with release dates: I saw two movies from him in the last two weeks, and I would go for a third in two weeks' time. Well written, well directed, well cast. I hope he'll stay on this track.

No need to say anything about the story. Liked 'American Beauty'? Liked 'The Ice Storm'? Liked 'The Squid and the Whale'? Trust me, you're gonna like this too.

Joan Allen haven't been so good since The Ice Storm. Well, she's never ever been so good! Although I have at least three American actresses in her two-years-of-age-radius, who I like more (Griffith, Hunter and Bening), but Griffith's voice would have been too sweet for the role, and the other two just had enough of the kind so far to put their fingers into something else.

And the role of the shabby, beer-guzzling but big-hearted ex baseball pro is something descending stars would kill for. Now, again and more so: there are way many more actors around 50, who could have played this hands down. (Suspect Jeff Bridges could have played it without even reading the script;-) Still, you can't complain about Kevin Costner. What's more, you might start hoping his agent will dig up some more of the sort for him, and he will grow on you.

The rest is all right, though E.R. Wood has to take a bigger step now, because I felt a bit like she made this and 'Running with Scissors' in a way of kill-two-birds-with-one-stone, without even changing her hat. But it's all right when she's just so cute, isn't it? I think when she comes of age, she'll surprise us with some more solid stuff, and won't disappear like Thora Birch or Dominique Swain.

Turning back to Binder for one comparison: this movie was better than 'Reign Over Me'. The difference is in the way you can empathize with characters or not. Maybe I'm just a drinker myself, and it's speaks for it's due, but I like sarcastic and bitter people clinging on a bottle of vodka but knowing perfectly well their boundaries THAN people who can be charming in their strange ways but once they get knocked off balance and drink the best part of a bottle, they get so p**sed they feel the urge to take a stroll with a loaded gun...(I think Binder would cut that part out now, after Virginia Tech...)

I couldn't blame her, it's a scary thing not knowing wither you want to hate someone you were brought up to love or just be unbiased. I recently rented The Upside of Anger, my mom watched it first, and said that she could've used this movie a long time ago, so I had to see what this movie was about.

It's about a mom and her 4 daughters, 3 whom she lives with, and she thinks her husband has left her and his daughters for his secretary and is currently living in Sweden. Denny, a neighbor and friend, offers to help the family out, but also ends up falling in love with the mom as she does as well with him. But trouble ensues as the girls feel more and more of the mom's wrath and the stress of not knowing where their father truly is.

The Upside of Anger has a terrific twist ending, but it showed the true emotions and the pain of being left alone. I could relate to the daughters the most obviously and my mom to Joan Allen. I think anyone from a broken home could relate and that's what made this movie very endjoyable.

Permalink",True,"I was really disappointed in this film. Kevin Costner was the best part of this film. That was unexpected but welcomed as this film was hard to stay with till the end.

Perhaps the most distracting feature of this film was the score. It sounded completely wrong--it was more like a score for a ""C"" rated film. I found the score jarring as it took me out of the film over and over again.

And I did not believe the daughters. None of them seemed like they were sisters though the youngest one was the most believable. The family never did gel into a cohesive unit. For example, what would make anyone believe that 3 daughters, who were home at the time and who told the Kevin Costner character that their mother was upstairs in the shower, would allow him to go up there to wait inside her bathroom unannounced while she showers behind a completely transparent shower door? At this point in the film, he was not much more than a stranger that they did not particularly like. It just did not make sense.

In retrospect, I think the surprise ending is what caused people to believe in this film though it really did not come as a surprise to me. After seeing this film, I was surprised at all the positive hype this film received and would not recommend it.

Permalink",True,"I like how the characters in the story are flawed and each has their own personal struggle. It is easy to relate to today's society because numerous amounts of children have to deal with divorce and separation as do the four daughters of the main character Terry Wolfmeyer, played by Joan Allen. Terry is left in a rut after her husband, Grey, simultaneously disappears the same time as his Swedish secretary. She is left deeply hurt and bitter and turns to alcohol to drown her sorrows.

Eldest daughter Hadley, portrayed by Alicia Witt tries to comfort her mother before graduating college, announcing her engagement and later pregnancy. Andy, who is played by Erika Christensen, represents a slightly rebellious and independent young adult. Her work at a radio station leads her to dating a sleazy older man, ""Shep"" Goodman played by the writer/director himself, Mike Binder. Close behind her is Emily illustrated by Keri Russell. Her impending eating disorder creates chaos and keeps her from achieving her goals as a ballerina. She has the ability to cover up her problem well and to any outsider her life would appear seemingly perfect. The youngest and perhaps wisest is Popeye, played by Evan Rachel Wood. Popeye primarily narrates the story and watches her mother turn into a hostile and sardonic alcoholic.

On the brink of slipping into depression Terry is rescued by drinking buddy Denny Davies a washed up baseball player turned radio talk show host played by Kevin Costner. Their innocent drinking turns into an intimate relationship and despite their spats the relationship survives. The fate Terry's husband is revealed and ultimately ends the film. What makes this movie great is that it shows how a separation or divorce can deeply impact so many and reveal what we were too blind to see right in front of us, such as Emily's eating disorder. Popeye's narration is conceivably the most excellent part of the film. It proves that people are scared knowing how quickly love can go bad so they avoid it or turn to anger for relief. It proves how her mother's antagonism transitions her into a better and more resilient person. Anger doesn't last forever. At the end it promises calm and tranquillity.

Permalink",False,"Here are the upsides of the romantic comedy ""The Upside of Anger"": Upside #1- Joan Allen's astonishing performance as Terry Ann Wolfmeyer, an angry mother of three young women, who must deal with the abrupt situation of her husband leaving her for a young secretary. Allen's anger management or mismanagement thespian work was one of the supreme of the year. I am in a state of rebellious anger because she was snubbed of a Best Actress academy award nomination.

Upside #2- Kevin Costner's charismatic performance as Denny Davies, the middle-age neighbor of Terry who all of a sudden becomes her probing confidante and eventually her sometime aficionado ( simply stated, he becomes her ""booty call"".) Davies was a former baseball star who now hosts his own radio sports show even though he despises talking about the major pastime himself. It is a comeback ace performance which was the relief that Costner needed out of the pun, I mean pen, to save his recent descending career.

Upside #3- Writer-Director Mike Binder's clever, witty, and highbrow script about dealing with a stress-inducing agent called ""change"" and how the anger inside of us is personally dealt internally and externally. Binder's scribe will be included in my ""Best Screenplays of 2005"" binder.

Upside #4- The beauty of Terry's daughters played by Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, Alicia Witt, and Evan Rachel Wood. What? You want me to elaborate on their acting. Why go there? Just look at these hotties and that would be enough. Let's just say that this ""Sister Act"" could relieve my anger anytime.

Permalink",False,"Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) has just found out that her husband's run off to Sweden with his secretary, leaving her to take care of the house and their four (mostly) grown daughters: Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood), Hadley (Alicia Witt), Emily (Keri Russell), and Andy (Erika Christensen). Terry soon turns to drink and the friendly comforts of her neighbor, ex-baseball great Denny Davies (Kevin Costner).

What should have been a touching treatise on Why Families Are Important instead de-evolves into a competition to see who can be the most pathetic, the most lecherous, the most indolent character. Chief among these transgressors is Terry herself, a woman with few (if any) redeeming values - although we're frequently reminded that she ""didn't used to be like this."" ""Redeeming"" is a good word here, because throughout the movie you keep expecting Terry to find redemption, that one day she'll wake up, put a drink down, and declare her love for her daughters, who are suffering from her verbal abuse. That she'll suddenly Get It and realize how wrong she's been. As the movie progresses, though, you keep hoping that doesn't happen, because then the only choice would be a sudden denouement, which might be even worse than her abuse.

Everyone who's close to Terry has to put up with her outrageous behavior. Emily is a devoted dancer, but Terry refuses to support her, opting instead to squash Emily's dreams. Andy wants to eschew college and get a job, but instead of working with her on that Terry chooses to demean her, especially after she gets a job working at the same radio station Denny does. Even Denny's not immune to her wrath. And none of it makes much sense. Sure, her husband left her. And sure, that'd drive anyone to drink. But does it really have to mean the continued abused of one's family? What really puzzles me about it, though, is that the movie veered sharply from alleged poignancy to ... well, broad comedy. And the shifts weren't subtle, either. Were we supposed to laugh at Terry, or with her? Should we have felt sympathy for an incorrigible boor? Allen is a great actress, and this would seem to be a fine, plum role for her, but I don't think she performed to the best of her abilities. Faring better was pretty much everyone else in the cast, especially Christensen and Costner. Yes, Kevin Costner. He's really quite likable as a supporting player nowadays."

Permalink",False,"This was, unfortunately, one of the least enjoyable films I've seen lately. Not ever, but lately. The characters don't seem real and are damn near impossible to associate with. Can't speak for Kevin Constner. He actually managed to take the inconstructive dialogue given to him by ""Shep"" (the director who plays a radio producer in the movie) and make most of it believable. Yet, most of the dialogue and the supposed ""anger"" did not seem natural at the least. The outbursts were as disproportioned as possible. I feel this was the aftermath of the writer trying to mix a load of raging emotions, some his own and some misdirected from the plot, into a movie about everyday issues but without a tight general plot to trail the movie along a single straight road. Instead, it goes in circles around the mother's unresolved anger, the daughters' unexplained anger in most parts, and Kevin's character kind of hiking around, in and out of their lives. The twist in the end, which I won't give away so people new to the film can still read this, strengthens the plot and therefore deviates the movie from the proposed ""comedy"" genre. I wouldn't call it a comedy either way, since neither of the jokes made me laugh; heck, half of them had the characters burst in laughter at odd times, as if to tell us that these are the funny parts. To the director, if you want to make a more believable movie on the subject, then stop calling it a comedy, and get deeper into the characters' personal lives (not just the mother-interactions). There would be more than one outcome people will perceive, so showing a school project done by a character is not the way to help carry out the message. If it worked, the message will have told itself all through the movie. But based on the other reviews, the movie did reach a lot of other people. Not me. Too much bitterness, even for an angry mother."

Permalink",True,"SPOILERS THROUGH:

The Upside Of Anger was a movie I had wanted to see, primarily because of the outstanding reviews it had received upon it's release. Unnfortunetly, I just couldn't get into this. I don't think it was awful or even bad but I would say I was disappointed.

Some thoughts as to what about this movie didn't do it for me. First off, there was very little character or scene development (Or maybe I should say plot development) in the beginning. From the first few minutes, the heaviness and somberness is there, but without any lead up, the characters are so haunted from the beginning. There is little to no Buildup, one knows the Allen and Costner character will be romantically involved very soon, there is no real buildup with these two individuals either. The stage is kind of set, from the beginning with sarcasm, little jabs and barbs, all a prelude to the romance that will inevitably follow. And I didn't see a lot of chemistry between them.

The movie, besides lacking the slow buildup of tension and drama, moves very slowly and there doesn't seem to be (at least in the beginning) much of a PLOT, but we the audience don't see the development of their angst, it's there in the first five minutes of the film (of coarse we can't see it's development for obvious reasons related to the ending but more on that later.) But the pace is very slow. It is hard to get drawn in. There is a rehearsed feel, particularly in the beginning. There are moments of fascination due mainly to the talent involved. But it isn't nearly as interesting as it looked from it's previews.

And lastly, the ending was just WRONG. I know many may disagree but I do not see what value this added. Why lace this film with tragedy, I understand the message behind it but the ending really took away from this movie and not only was unnecessarily tragic and dark but unrealistic as well. A movie can be sad and heavy etc but this ending just didn't go. I felt it was more a negative then a positive.

And the positives of the movie were there. great cast, Interesting characters, Costner plays a good role. Allen is such a talented lady and each of the actresses playing the daughters brought something unique to their roles. And the themes of the movie and what it says about anger, are something I understand. I also commend the movie for not being necessarily mainstream. Those are some of the reasons I gave it a 6 and not a 3 or 4 as I would other movies I wasn't into. Upside isn't a terrible movie but it wasn't for me. Everyones' got their own opinions and tastes though. My vote's 6 out of 10.

Permalink",False,"In my opinion,the ""Upside of Anger"" which directed by Mike Binder, is a better comedy this year. The name of it- ""Upside of Anger"", clearly represented the feelings and emotions changing of Denny Davies and Terry Wolfmeger. Denny, a retired baseball star, was angry because his work and life were not as he expected. He felt pessimistic and wanted to give up with anger. His anger was even strong enough to break the door with his legs. On the other hand, Terry, a married woman who had 4 teen-aged daughters, was angry because she thought her husband had gone with his Swedish secretary. And her 4 lovely daughters(Hadley, Andy, Emily and Popeye), did not listen to her. A series of such bad events happened to them. They felt upset and depressed, accumulated...and changed into anger progressively. The part of this movie which I liked most was the scene that Shep ate with the Wolfmeger's. He drank soup loudly with noise then his head exploded suddenly. His blood splashed onto the wall and the faces of the Wolfmeyer's. It was just the imagination of Terry's feeling for Shep. She did not like Shep but he did not notice. She hated him with anger and wanted him to die. After Terry's imagination of Shep's head explosion, she gave her a cold smile. It was a 'black humor'- a sense of humor with sarcasm. This scene lasted for several minutes. I believed it was the 'peak' of that movie. There was a man laughed very loudly for a long time in the cinema where I watched the movie. I agreed with his feeling. I also laughed with surprise because Shep's head exploded suddenly! Besides the different kinds of anger inside this movie, there were also kinds of loves from it. Love between lovers, love between family, love between neighbors and colleague. Sometimes they were funny enough to make the audiences laughed. I believed the love stories described from this movie were quite practical although it's just a comedy with dramatic. That means that it's possible for some similar love stories happen in our real lives. I remembered the puppy love of Popeye and Gordon. Popeye loved him but finally found him was gay. Sometimes I'll watch movies starring by Kevin Costner. I remembered his ""Message In A Bottle"", ""Waterworld"". It's my second time watching Joan Allen's movies. I remembered she starred in the movie ""Face/ Off"". I know they are good actor and actress. And they were the award winners from their careers. Will they and the ""Upside of Anger"" be nominated in the coming Annual Academy Awards, such as Oscar?"

Permalink",True,"I am assuming that I haven't seen all the movies out there so i'll give this one the benefit of the doubt and rate it a 2. Anyone who likes this movie must have misunderstood the ending. SPOILER ALERT!! Her husband didn't leave her!!! Joan Allen's husband fell into an abandoned well behind her house, and has been dead during the three years that she's been kanoodling with Kevin Costner. I actually had to rewind and re-watch the scene where her husband is discovered to believe that it was in the script. That scene alone turns an average romantic dramedy into a desperate attempt at depth. It felt as if the writers, sensing the mediocrity of their script formula (predictable right down to the sick child that breaks the cycle of anger!), decided to add a twist ending without knowing quite what to do with it. The ending is meaningless, and even more so since it is unexplored- the movie ends right at the husband's funeral without giving the viewer a chance to process the effect of the biggest incident in the film on the characters. It is a pity that the wonderful Joan Allen was wasted in such garbage.

Permalink",False,"... I didn't like anyone.

Mike Binder is a truly gifted writer. He has an exceptional flair for deep dialog that feels quite real. I enjoyed his previous work such as ""The Mind of a Married Man."" I am a long time fan of Joan Allen. Her acting is always exceptional. I especially enjoyed her performance in ""The Contender"". This is better. She plays this role exceptionally well. The arms-length attraction to Kevin Costner works well. The casting was well done.

Other technical aspects of this movie work as well. The direction and cinematography are unobtrusive. There is nothing that stands out, but that's typically a good thing.

The problem with the movie is that I didn't particularly care for any of the people in the movie. It's important that I relate to at least one of the primary characters to truly enjoy a movie. There is great depth to the performances, but I just couldn't find the experiences in my life that allowed me to relate on an emotional level.

I give this high marks for the technical work. I think many will find this an exceptional movie, if their life experience has been different than mine. I respect the movie a lot, but I didn't have the visceral reaction that makes a movie exceptional for me."

Permalink",False,"For the past 8 years, Hollywood has been on an extremely sharp downfall with the movies they choose to make. But every now and then, they actually stop being so parasitic and say yes to a script and director who actually took more than 24 hours to write the screenplay.

We all know where Kevin Costner has been since Dances With Wolves. NOWHERE. The reason he was so believable with the role of Denny Davies was because THAT IS WHO HE IS NOW. His best role since DWW. Now Joan Allen who has never taken a misstep with her career scores another (hopefully another Oscar nomination as well) solid gold hit. Watching her I was watching my mother 12 years ago. Maybe the similarities hit even more close to home because my mother had 3 daughters, in the film Allen's character had 4. Believe me, all 3 of us are smart asses and we have challenged our mother every day.

Upside of Anger will stick out in my mind for 1 thing: the fact that it brings back 17 different emotions from the dead in all of us.

The fact is this movie came at the right time. I haven't completely lost all faith in Hollywood and the money making machine. But we need more character driven films like this.

If you watch it and don't feel anything, I recommend that you see a doctor because that condition of yours could get a lot worse."

Permalink",False,"The latest romantic-comedy available to rent and own on DVD is Mike Binder's 'The Upside of Anger'. I meant to go see it while it was still playing in the movie theaters because of all the positive buzz critics gave it, but somehow I missed it. When it finally came out at Blockbuster I rented it expecting a very good film, and I have to say I was a little disappointed. I can't understand why Roger Ebert gave it 4-stars along with many of the other film critics. It's a good movie, but nothing Oscar worthy (except maybe for Joan Allen's terrific performance). I guess since it came from Mike Binder, who was the creator of HBO's short-lived but nonetheless brilliant sit-com 'The Mind of the Married Man', I thought the film would be a tad more raunchy and laugh-out-loud hysterical. Although 'The Upside of Anger' garners some funny moments, it never reaches to point of hilarity. 'The Upside of Anger' to my dismay turned out to be your typical chick-flick, but at least is was a superior chick flick thanks mostly to Joan Allen.

The movie centrals around a middle-aged single mother of four beautiful daughters, Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen). As her youngest daughter Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood - Thirteen) narrates, her mother used to be a kind, generous and caring woman, but ever since her husband left her and the s for his Swedish assistant, she's become an angry and bitter woman. Now that the man of the house is gone, Terry is always pessimistic and whenever she gets a chance. She takes it out on Popeye as well as her other three daughters; Emily (Keri Russell) a high school aged aspiring ballet dancer with an eating disorder, Andy (Erika Christensen - Traffic), a just-out-of high school wild who doesn't want to go to college, and Hadley (Alicia Witt - Urban Legend) a recent college graduate who's getting married to a classmate and pregnant with his child. Terry is going crazy with all the different problems her children have, and not having a man around the house. During the course of the film she starts to take a liking to a man in the neighborhood, Denny (Kevin Costner) who's a mostly-drunk retired baseball player with a bad radio show with low-ratings. Terry starts to get romantically involved with Denny, while Denny's boss Shep (Mike Binder - the writer/director of the film) starts to take a liking to Terry's daughter Andy. There's a lot of anguish and arguments through-out the film surrounding Terry's mission to be happy in the estrogen filled emotional roller coaster 'The Upside of Anger' is.

'The Upside of Anger' sometimes falls into the cliché romantic-comedy storyline, but for the most part manages to be sort of inventive. Joan Allen gives an outstanding performance as the angry mother Terry that might just earn her an Oscar nod next year. Kevin Costner may just give his best performance since 'Dances with Wolves' as the silly, ignorant but lovable Denny, and Mike Binder is extremely witty for the limited screen time his character has. Evan Rachel Wood gives the finest performance out of all of the daughters, while Keri Russell is very good also but Erika Christensen and Alicia Witt are disappointing in a way. Mike Binder does a decent job scripting and directing this motion picture, but nothing really Oscar worthy. I'd say 'The Upside of Anger' is definitely more enjoyable if your a female rather then a male. If you take the good and take the bad of 'The Upside of Anger' and end up calculating it, the movie ends up being good. I recommend it as a rental, because for four bucks it's probably worth it. Grade: B-

my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."

Permalink",False,"Aggression is something that many of us have not only felt, but have seen change other people. It is a human theme and it is therefore easy to connect to when it is shown screen. For this reason, a number of viewers will perhaps take well to this film. However, those same people would take well to an average run-of-the-mill telepic that deals with the same issues, as this film is no better than such productions. Although the ideas and issues are easy to relate to, the same stuff has been explored in many other films, many times before, and the fashion that they are presented in here is very hackneyed. The characters are never better than ordinary, and they are even a tad annoying to have on screen. There is also a severe under-development of Joan Allen's character, as we see her angry, but we do not see her before she changes, and therefore there is no contrast: no visible change. Allen has received a lot of praise for being so angry and stressed, but she is never not - so she is just playing one emotional type - and I cannot call that a good performance myself. The rest of the cast deliver reasonably well, but there are no great performances. I really cannot call this a very good film, but if it could have brought something new in, then I feel the film could have risen above the mark.

For viewers who are not American it oozes middle-class Americana which in itself is OK except it is all a bit too comfortable. Perhaps not being American I didn't get a lot of the in jokes. Maybe this is why I found it so unfunny. The mother is extremely unlikable. The script was mindless. I can't believe Rolling Stone thought it was so good. I will not believe them again. Because we never met the husband the revelatory twist about him was incongruous and disjointed- tacked on the end like an after thought. Why should we care about what happened to him since we hadn't met him in the movie? Overall I thought this was a pretentious movie- not witty and profound as alleged and very boring.

The husband's only function in the plot was to disappear and so start her on that journey. The discovery of his body at the end negated her achievements. I felt really cheated by the ending. I felt that the ending was decided by a committee who couldn't stand the idea of an American father abandoning his daughters. Kevin Kostner's character faltered when he kicked down the bath-room door. Nothing that we learnt about him was consistent with that. I was thoroughly enjoying the film that was basically a love-story for greying baby-boomers until the end. It could have been a really good movie of its type, but it was spoilt by by the ""sweetening"".

Permalink",False,"Okay. so, a lot of it just doesn't work... Not so much that you can't help think it's a gem. The ending sort of sucks. I'm sorry to say that. The daughters got on my nerves a little. Especially the one from Cybill (the one that thought her face was fat but wasn't) Maybe that's just funny to woman. I think a lot of it is good writing because of that. Stuff that's only funny to guys and then stuff that's only funny to women. I think Kevin Silverado is really good in this one. Funny as hell. Really funny. He's a good comedian. Joan Allen steals it though but that's because Binder wrote it for her. Binder is the next best though. Love his character a lot. Also like Kerri Russel I guess.

I'm not completely sold on the ending like I say but I like the writing and directing. Best movie of it's kind since Sideways. (Adult, smart, funny, classy etc..) Mike Binder is big time now. Pretty cool after all the guff he took from Mind of The Married man haters. I say good on him. I'm there for your next one MIKEY!!! You rule....

Permalink",True,"I've enjoyed Mike Binder ever since ""Diner"". He is brilliant. However, some of the characters were just annoying....but then again it was a movie with five drama queens, one dead man and two others with one foot in the grave each.

Somehow in the editing viewers became a bit confused about what happened to Hadley's first pregnancy when she announced her second one. Perhaps viewers need to be hit over the head with a hammer as Dan Akroyd did in ""The Blues Brothers"" when after spraying marine epoxy on the gas pedal of the Countrymen's motor home he holds the can at the camera and says ""Strong glue!"".

This movie had a strange twist. Started off as a romantic comedy and ended as a murder mystery. Sweet to sour and therefore hardly fits the tag line. I think they will get torn apart again forever with guilt and suspicion.

The quotes were memorable:

I think you know my position on free food.

What can I say? I have four girls. Two that hate me and one or two that are leaning that way.

I know that on some level this is too soon and perhaps not right. And, on the other level? I dial your number ten times a day and hang up!

Permalink",False,"This is Mike Binder's best movie yet and it shows a major step forward in the growth of a great American filmmaker. When most writers and directors are making sad versions of yet another Saturday night live failed comedy Binder is making comedies about something with depth in the vein of fellow filmmakers Alexander Payne and the master James L. Brooks. Terry Wolfmeyer is a wonderful creation, a character right out of a novel rather than a cookie cutter wife mother role fresh baked from a television sitcom. This is Joan Allen in all of her glory. A wounded bird in a long winter who still needs to feed the nest and keep her head up towards spring.

Kevin Costner has NEVER been better. Never. Not in Bull Durham, not in Dances With Wolves or Field of Dreams. This is a Paul Newmanesque star turn. He is flawed and funny and fat and PERFECT. Kevin Costner can act. He is Newman, McQueen, Hoffman and Deniro all rolled into one. What a performance.

The other actors all do first rate jobs from Erica Christenson to Kerri Russel to Evan Rachel Wood. These are the three best working young actresses out they're in my opinion and all do superb work. Binder is perfect in the role of Shep, a brave role for him to take and in my opinion the best acting job he has ever done and I am a huge fan of The sex monster and The minority Report.

This movie will wear well I guarantee it. Expect to see Joan Allen nominated and Kevin Costner as well. They both deserve it and had it come out last fall or later this year it would have been a major contender in several categories. It's an honest brave thoughtful film. The Hannah and her Sisters of it's time.

I recommend this film to everyone that likes smart films.

Permalink",False,"Reading the commercial reviews for this film only confirms my belief that no reviewers can be trusted and that most of the reviews are probably bought and paid for by the production companies.

This is a film about a woman supposedly entirely changed by her rage when she is left by her husband. But through the entire film, the change is reflected in two ways only: by Joan Allen's cold, robotic expression for 90% of the film, and by her rude treatment of the daughters she supposedly loves. It was to me entirely unbelievable that Kevin Costner's character, who is typically Costner-warm and accessible, would be attracted to such a creature. It certainly wouldn't be because of her personality, and it's hard to imagine it could be because of her emaciated body. The film's billing as a ""dark comedy"" is just as strange. I found not a single scene worthy of a smile, much less laughter - unless Allen's reflexive cruelty to (1) her daughters; (2) Costner; (3) her daughter's doctor; (4) one daughter's love interest, or bedding interest, etc., etc., is what passes for humor in American film these days.

That's what annoyed me the most. Film has such enormous potential: to enlighten, inspire, bring a little joy or laughter, provoke thought. When a film does none of these, and still gets glowing reviews from the mainstream press, it's just flat-out depressing.

Not only Allen's character is flat: the film's story flatlines until the last 5 minutes. One daughter is hospitalized, supposedly seriously ill. We see her in the hospital bed once, then she's out, radiant. What was her illness? did Mom ever talk to her about it except for 5 seconds in the hospital room? No way. Mom is so distraught over daughter's illness she actually reveals humanity and cries. But does she respect her daughter's heartfelt wish that Dad be notified of her illness? No way. Such behavior is either errant nonsense or indicative of characters so devoid of human warmth and responsibility as to be completely unsympathetic to any slightly discerning audience.

Alas, American audiences are so famished for movies with real meat and heart and brain, this drivel is praised as funny and smart. Pathetic."

I recommend buying the DVD (which has several uncut scenes and a good bit of background on the film) This is such a cool story and has a great message about letting anger get you to misjudge your life and your world. It has a quality that makes it almost feel like a novel. I will be one of the first in line for Mike Binder's next films. He is my new favorite director/writer/actor. I thought all of his characters and actors were perfectly portrayed. Everyone here has said how great Joan Allen is but I am going to say that Erica Christenen and Kerry Russell were the two best things in the movie..(next to Kevin Costner) This is funny and warm and real and a great film. It's cool that people still make movies like this. Hats off to Mike Binder and the producers of this movie. (New Line?)

Buy or rent the DVD if you missed it in theaters. You won't be dissatisfied.

The characters, yet flawed, are all likable and the performances by everyone enhance this. Joan Allen is the star and boy does she know how to play her parts. At first I thought she was going to reenact her role from The Ice Storm, but I was wrong. If anything, this is the complete opposite. She gives a strong performance and you really feel for her character and the pain she's in. Also, Kevin Costner is great as the neighbor who is always stoned and drunk and develops a unique relationship with Allen. The 4 daughters are good in their performances, just wished we could spend a little more time with them. Finally, writer/director Mike Binder plays a very unique character and does it well. The script and direction are great, and although some music ques may seem odd at points, it adds up in the end. Like Finding Neverland, this is overall a feel good movie in the end, but not too sentimental.

Permalink",False,"I knew from the second I first saw the trailer for this movie last year that I had to see it. It's so rare that middle-aged adults initiate a relationship in a movie, and I thought the casting of Joan Allen and Kevin Costner as the couple was inspired. Like Sideways, it has a scene of surpassing honesty and pathos, when Costner talks about being attracted to the noise and activity of Allen's household.

This film is definitely worth your time. It's not quite an manipulative as Terms of Endearment, a film many have mentioned it in the same breath with. It does have a mother's sometimes tortured relationships with her lively daughters. Her fall into drinking may or may not have been abrupt, but she seems to stop drinking surprisingly rapidly.

All of the girls are excellent, and Evan Rachel Wood, as usual, is the stand-out.

One thing I have to say about this movie is I didn't realize the obnoxious character of Shep was played by the director himself (Mike Binder).

Kevin Costner and the girls playing the daughters were a treat and were the only thing that kept me in my seat for the whole movie. Personally I would not recommend this movie to anyone since it looked like an ad for the liquor companies. And by golly there was smoking in this movie. Didn't Hollywood know the smoking Nazis will come after them for that? But I digress....this movie will be a ""one time only"" for me and will definitely not be on my ""to buy"" list when it comes out on DVD.

Permalink",True,"For a while i thought i was watching Desperate Housewives but i finally twigged with the appearance of many daughters. Bring on the drunks; quite nice drunks really - no physical abuse, minimum shouting and swearing - not how i've seen it really happening in a family. Costner and Joan Allen make a good job of being drunks (method acting?)but the story stumbles from one situation to another. Not sure what the point of the story was - the ending is a real cop-out but ties in with Desperate Housewives in that there's a hidden body but in this case no-one is looking for it - pity really - would have stopped this drunk drama in its wobbly tracks.

Permalink",True,"The Upside of Anger is a romantic drama set in suburban Detroit. Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) is p--sed-off, mad as h--l, and she isn't going to take it any longer. Her husband is gone---run off with his Swedish secretary---and Terry has canceled the credit cards, changed the door locks, and taken to bed with a stiff gin and tonic. She explains all this to her four teen daughters around the dining room table as they eat dinner. Several days later Denny (Kevin Coaster) shows up, knocking at the front door and checking the patio door locks. Denny's not who you'd expect; rather, he's a neighbor who wears a World Series ring, and makes his living autographing baseballs and hosting talk radio----but he can't bring himself to discuss baseball. Terry and Danny would have little to say to one another under ordinary circumstances; but, they've intersected at a unique point in their lives---and the process begins. Terry and her daughters bring humanity into Danny' otherwise sterile life; they respect him for who he is, not for what he used to be. Danny brings a perspective to Terry' situation and is someone she can confide in and trust. Danny also takes his share of tough love from Terry who is neither bashful nor just anyone's fool. The ""upside of anger"" emerges as Terry moves through the sequence of shock, anger, realization and action, and her family is better as a consequence.

The Upside of Anger is in many ways similar to Terms of Endearment (1983) that won the big-five Oscar awards; this film could do at least as well. Let's get one thing out of the way now; this is not a 'Kevin Coaster film'. The storyline creates a well-crafted balance between drama, dark humor, irony and a coming of age story. The script and dialog are sharp, crisp, fast and deftly mixes humor, anger, and lovesometimes all in one sentence. Joan Allen is, simply put, huge in this film; she just keeps getting better as her career evolves. As in her other hits she plays an 'ice princess', a strong leading female character like no other actress in the business today, and few stars before her. She neither smiles nor shows emotion toward her children, except a stern disciplinary statement or two, as her character unfolds. At one point she says: ""you need to watch me more closely"" in reply to one of the kids challenge to her devotion to the family. Coaster is perfectly cast as a retired ball player adrift in his after baseball afterlife. He is the perfect foil to Joan Allen's anger and dialog.

The Upside of Anger opened in early March at just eight (8) screens, but could be playing at your local multi-cinema before you know it. The film is directed, written and co-stars Mike Binder a relative unknown who also plays Coaster' radio producer 'Shep' a sleazy skirt chaser. Finally, this is not a story about what happened to Terry's husband; sharp-eyed viewers will conclude shortly after the opening credits that this is a mute point.

The movie was obviously written by those low class types who think anguish, bad manners, bad table manners, smoking, drinking, being drunk and stupid and acting like an ass constantly is the height of good writing and ""meaning"".

Watching these actors sucking on cigarettes to facilitate the smoking industry's slick and successful attempt to keep people hooked on cancer sticks is disgusting; and drunks falling all over themselves, whining and crying while living in huge mansions and living large is pathetic.

Whine whine whine. Who cares?

Then watching them shovel food into gaping mouths at the table, stuffing their drunken faces with forks in their left hand in the typical low class manner in most east coast movies makes you want to never eat popcorn at a movie again with transference endemic to such bad manners.

And then the scene where the selfish, self-centered drunks hold up all of traffic with their two cars blocking everyone, while they just sat and talked! I would have gotten out and kicked both their drunken asses. Then she speeds through a neighborhood in her drunken state, waving at the old guy who keeps telling her to slow down because there are children playing. Right, individual rights to drive drunk with children around. The liberal pampered self is indulged....no time outs for adults, just movies about them.

Absolutely horrible movie. If you think Jeff Goldbloom and Woody Alan and that cabal of neurotic masturbatory-pre-occupied, sexually obsessed guilt-ridden self-centered wussie boys who wear funny little caps to their temple a movie for you.

Permalink",True,"A couple of weekends ago my husband and I went to see, ""The Upside of Anger"", written by, directed by and co-starring Mike Binder of HBO's, ""Mind of a Married Man"", fame and also starring Joan Allen, Kevin Costner and four of the loveliest young ladies working in the business; Alicia Witt, Erica Christensen, Keri Russell and Evan Rachel Wood. Wowwhat a collective of talent in this film! Binder's story is engaging and fresh, I can't think of any film that this film reminds me of and yet I was at home and could relate to many of the feelings from a personal level. There was a natural quality to the direction, nothing posed or stagedmoments were real, like you were looking into these lives rather than having their stories dramatized for you. I really think Mike Binder deserves a lot of praise for his story and his direction and I hope he gets it. His character of Shep is so well acted that I have decided that I need to look back at all the films I have seen Mike Binder in. I loved ""Mind of the Married Man"" and his work in ""The Contender"" (where he met Joan Allen) but I want to revisit this talented guys workhe's a treat and he's so good you just love him and hate him.

Joan Allen is an actors actor - she breaths so much passion into the character that she brings to life that you swear that you can recognize this person. Her Terry Wolfmeyer is one scary, angry and bitter lady and yet you love heryou desperately want to see her happy and balanced and lusted after. Yes, really, really lusted after. She's gorgeous, sexy-as-hell and smart and you really want her to find someone who can see that in her. And gosh, does she luck out in that area. We should all be so lucky as to have Kevin Costner wander into our backyards, beer in hand, vulnerability pouring off of him and ""love me"" in his eyes. Kevin Costner has referred to his character of ""Denny Davies"" as a St. Bernard of sorts who wanders from yard to yard to see who's having a BBQ and Terry's home becomes his favorite haunt.

Kevin Costner has been for nearly twenty years my favorite someone on the screen and this film is a very, very good reminder of why. Through all the films that the regurgitating mass of critics panned en masse as it was easier for them to go with the flow than actually take the time to get to know, I've been proud of and on occasion outspoken about his work. On screen, behind the camera and calling the directorial shots, he translates moments in a way that I can relate to and I really appreciate that experience through him. In this film his job is that of actor and he does it in top form. Consistently drunk or stoned or both, Denny meanders through this whole film as the only person giving and unabashedly seeking unconditional love during a period in the lives of this stories other characters where everyone is either abusing it, refusing it or being blind to it. You just want to hug Denny and climb under the blanket with him and hide from all the yelling and angerbut you couldn't keep him there for long, 'cause like any canine he's too curious and too anxious to please and make everything better.

Thank you God for Dogs.

To call Kevin Costner underrated is old newsanyone who really appreciates the art of telling a story from the various capacities that one can do that in the film industry will appreciate his work in this film and in the end those are the only opinions to care about.

Alicia Witt, Erica Christensen, Keri Russell and Evan Rachel Wood each deserves their own paragraph because they each handled their characters in this very adult story with class and with oodles of talent. So well in fact that I know I'll have many more chances to write paragraphs on each as they continue to work. And I gladly will.

This is a passionate, funny, heartbreaking and heartwarming story that deserves great big audiences and whole lot of attention. Bravo to Mike Binder for this accomplishment and for his wisdom to select such a stellar ensemble of players to bring this piece of life onto the screen. It's unfortunate that his treasure has not been supported as it deserves - this film is NOT getting the ""promotion"" that it truly merits. Shame on New Line and anyone involved in the total lack of promotion for this film. I guess it must be true then, telling a great story isn't worth as much as ""flash"",""bling"",""smash"",""groan"" or ""screech"". Maybe during the increasingly longer stretches between gems of this caliber I will go back to books, where story-telling still matters.

Permalink",False,"Continuing my plan to watch ever Kevin Costner movie in order I come to The Upside Of Anger from 2005

Plot In A Paragraph: Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) a suburban wife, is left to raise her four headstrong daughters when her husband unexpectedly leaves (presumably to Sweden with his secretary) without a trace. Things get even more hectic when she falls for her neighbour Denny (a scene stealing KC) a once-great baseball star turned radio d.j. This leaves her daughters out on a limb.

The Upside Of Anger is a funny film for me. It's filled with brilliant performances, is well written, and well directed. But for some reason I never watch it. This is one of my least viewed KC movies, despite it featuring a great performance from him. All the cast are brilliant, Joan Allen always is, Erika Christensen (i expected to see more of her, but I never have) Kerr Russell, Alicia Witt and Evan Rachel Wood all play the daughters really well.

But as the lonely alcoholic drinking buddies Terry and Denny Allen and KC own this movie, I think in the hands of two lesser actors this wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. KC simply steals every scene he is in and I believe he deserved on Oscar nomination. In fact Joan Allen should have been nominated too.

I remember a lot of reviews focused on how great KC was in it, and suggested this would be a contender around Oscar time, and when KC and Joan Allen were both nominated for Critics Choice awards, I thought it might have a chance, but it didn't earn a single nomination, and it didn't actually turn up in the UK until 2007. By which point I had already seen his next two movies and was awaiting Mr Brooks. When it was released over here unexpectedly with no promotion. If I didn't see a critics review in The Sun newspaper, I never would have known it was released. For a movie of this quality I think that's a disgrace."

There are great actresses at work here. Joan Allen has all the skills to bring the anger, the frustration, and the likability for us to still root for her. There are some moments of levity, and a couple of good jokes. There is even a great moment between her and Shep (Mike Binder). Mike Binder does a good job as writer/director. However, he could add a few more jokes to liven up the movie.

Permalink",False,"The Upside of Anger is a much better film than I have anticipated. I thought this would be some bad romantic comedy, but it's not really a romantic comedy. It's a family drama that is centered around family life with a little bit of romance on the side. This film has support of a very unexpected twist ending, an emotional/heartfelt story, and incredibly strong acting. I was surprised on how emotional I felt after the end of the movie, because the film will really get to you.

Mike Binder's film is about a family of one strong-willed woman and her four daughters. After a terrible accident in the family, Terry starts a new thing with her neighbor, ex-baseball player Denny Davies while facing the teenage/college hormones of her daughters.

The acting is very, very good. Surprisingly, Joan Allen gives one of her best performances ever with her role as Terry. You can relate to her even though sometimes you just want to hate her. Kevin Costner also gives a solid performance even though it's second to Joan Allen's performance. The daughters played by Keri Russell, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, and Alicia Witt also give solid performances.

Overall, this is a great film that is an acting showcase. This is a good film that is about the ways of family and how they all bond together despite differences. Even thought there are some strong, emotional moments, there are also some sweet, light-hearted moments as well. I rate this film 9/10."

I will say that if you are a guy and can make it through this weeper, the ending contains a grisly shock. Also, the daughters are all drop-dead gorgeous, and show off a fair amount of skin.

Permalink",False,"*** out of **** stars

I must admit, that when I first saw the trailer for The Upside of Anger, it came across to me as perhaps boring, perhaps shallow, perhaps cliché. It's nothing of the sort. What we have here is a melding of flavors; something of a Woody Allen/Coen brothers hybrid coasting along the seasons of Michigan. Humor is not without despondency. Dialouge is not without wit. The silent contemplation of the characters is not without the disturbing yet comforting contemplation by us as viewers. It's always a surprising pleasure, no matter how much I experience it, to witness silent acting that reads between the lines, and tells a story without superfluous jargon. You gotta know when to talk, but you gotta know when to shut up too.

Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) is a mother of four high school and college age daughters, and her husband has surprisingly run off with his secretary to a land far, far away. As we learn more about Terry, we can see why. She's continuously boozy yet functioning, sadly and hysterically cynical, systematically bitter, unknowingly shallow and insultingly forward. Her daughters are all headstrong and smart, trying to find their way in the world. Terry has her own idea of how they should live their lives and plan their futures, not recognizing their inherent talents and strengths, or not choosing to. Denny (Kevin Costner), a friend of the disappeared hubby, shows up on Terry's lawn with a beer in his hand, wanting a drinking buddy. We instantaneously sense a relationship will ensue, but it doesn't happen without the difficulty and maturity that can only take place between two adults in their 40's or 50's who have been through the ringer a time or two. All the daughters approve of him, which is probably why Terry is so slow to come around to his quirky advances. Denny is an ex-Detroit Tiger hero who hates talking about his once beloved sport as a radio DJ. Will Costner ever shake that America's favorite pastime vibe? He doesn't need to here. It works out just fine. Yet what has made him so reluctant and irritated about chatting up RBIs and home-runs is an underdeveloped part of the narrative. The film really belongs to Allen.

What gives Upside so much light and life are the daughters, played by Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt. All of them obviously and equally understood what screenwriter and director Mike Binder intended for them to bring to the screen, which puts much light on him for either not allowing himself to compromise his vision, or for selecting the correct choices of talent, or both. Binder also co-stars as an unashamed, disgusting Lothario, and a producer at Denny's radio station.

I believe The Upside of Anger will appeal to all ages (kids aside of course) and all breeds of movie watchers. Ladies may enjoy it as a ""chick flick"". Indie enthusiasts may like it's originality and dark charm. Middle aged men may identify with Denny's apathy for a sport he once loved and the attraction he has for Terry's melodramatic family. In short, I think this movie can interest and entertain everyone. And what a complement that is! If I do say so myself."

Permalink",False,"This is a deeply disappointing film from Mike Binder, considering how brilliant his 'Reign over Me' would be two years later. The best thing about the film is Kevin Costner, who is warm, fills the screen, and is totally watchable throughout, pro that he is. Joan Allen, who in other films, such as more recently, 'The Bourne Ultimatum', is a powerful actress of impressive appearance, should never have made this film, because at the time she seems to have been in a state of extreme anorexia or bulimia. Her body in this is so vanishingly thin that her head looks like a transplant of a pumpkin on a narrow corn stalk. In one scene, her neck ligaments are so pronounced that one fears she may use them to strangle the sound man. She should have gone into rehab rather than film this, but it seems that she did afterwards, as she seemed OK in the latest 'Bourne'. In the film, she has four daughters, all of whom look disconcertingly as if they are the same age. None of them can speak clearly, and they mumble and swallow their dialogue as if it were a secret they were loathe to reveal to us. They all suffer from what I call 'Dakota Fanning Syndrome', which is the tendency to talk like spoilt, musing babies, making only 20% of the words comprehensible. It seems that kids can't speak anymore. I guess their vocal chords are shrivelling up while they strengthen their thumbs with text messaging. Mike Binder is very good at playing the character 'Shep', and it is a pity the best he did this time around was as an actor, as his script is really deeply flawed. Without revealing what happens at the end of the film, I cannot adequately explain how totally, utterly implausible the whole story really is, to a degree which I find deeply shocking. Are we really meant to believe this tale? The profundity of the film is, alas, only mock-profundity. Binder's attempts to explore deep things are only successful with Costner's character, but fail otherwise. The people in the film are uniformly nauseating, spoilt brat, narcissistic, self-pitying creeps. The worst of all is the monster mother, played by Joan Allen. If her intention was to make us hate her, she certainly succeeded. There is actually no one in the film with whom I had an ounce of sympathy except the daughter played by Keri Russell, who wants to be a dancer. Good for her. She is the only character in the film worth a moment's time or attention. The way in which girls as young as 15 talk in this film constantly about screwing is deeply disturbing. It may be true to life, but then that truth about life is equally disturbing. Apart from the dancing daughter, there is no one in this film with any aim or purpose, and they are all so spoilt rotten that they are sickening. Come on Binder, what is this all about? Did you really think you could squeeze some juice out of these dry and sour lemons? After watching a whole film of Joan Allen being a monster, it was hari-kari time."

Permalink",True,"I am a huge Kevin Costner fan and I waited a long to see The Upside of Anger because I figured it to be an 'okay' movie...average at best and as with all great surprises this one floored me because The Upside of Anger is absolutely brilliant and now goes onto my favorites list for all time. There is something subtle about the way the film plays out, and also so real and demanding and high emotions from beginning to end from each member of this seemingly dysfunctional family that always manages to pull together. The twist at the end is the exact definition of a twist. There was absolutely no way you saw anything like this coming, and the last few moments of the film completely change everything that came before it. You become so intertwined with this woman's bitter anger, and emotions that discovering that twist makes you feel exactly the way she would have felt and it's devastating and relieving all at once...it's the ""Upside of Anger.""

I completely believe that there were some severely overlooked performances for Golden Globes, Academy Awards and so forth in this film and one of them hands down is Joan Allen who turns a downright incredible performance as Terry Ann Wolfmeyer, the mother of four beautiful girls who finds herself abandoned by her husband following a mid life crisis of sorts. Terry quickly becomes the ideal functional alcoholic, always a drink in her hand but also still up and interacting and hovering protectively over her children. Unfortunately her spite and anger come across as bitter and sharp comments that leave her family feeling her bite. Allen is drop dead amazing in this role!! Kevin Costner is almost as impressive as radio talk show host and equally functioning alcoholic Denny Davies. Davies has a washed up baseball career, sells autographed balls on the internet, lives in squaller and drinks like a fish and somehow Davies and Terry find a common bond in their misery. Costner is upbeat and depressing all at once. He is also truly one of the good guys because he genuinely loves and cares for Allen's character and stands with her through everything in hopes to find love back. He's the most upstanding sleaze ball I've ever seen. He has morals and loves his new family. The four daughters are such an integral part of this film because each one develop a different way that their mother's anger effects them. Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, Alicia Witt, and Evan Rachel Wood are so good both together with the cast and in their own right. Christensen develops a more outgoing and determined personality desperate to make something of herself and be a strong woman. Russell's character has her dreams severely dampened by her mother's harsh words and non-supportive comments. Alicia Witt hides her new found love from her mother so as to not have it ruined and quickly marries and has children to escape her. And the young Evan Rachel Wood tries to adjust to teenage life with a gay friend that she likes and her older sisters changing personalities. They all do an amazing job!! Terrific director Mike Binder also plays a supporting role as radio Producer 'Shep' who has a taste for young women including the young Andy Wolfmeyer played by Christensen. Binder is great as the sleazy and yet down to earth Shep who really just makes his moves for himself and you don't really want to hold that against him. A particularly powerful scene involves an intense argument between Shep and Allen's character.

The Upside of Anger might be one of the most powerful drama's I have seen in a very long time and given me a great deal of respect for Joan Allen and Mike Binder. The film doesn't blow you away right away but has this subtle intelligence and such deep emotion that draws you in and makes you such a huge part of each character's lives and then leaves you breathless. This is an absolute must see film. It's drama, romance, mystery, and just emotion boiling over. This film is extremely under rated and few really appreciate it for what it is and I am proud to say that I appreciate it as one of my favorite films of all time!! 10/10

This is the first time I sat through a Mike Binder movie, a guy I kind of vaguely remember as 'that Crow dude from Minority Report', but other than that I shook my head. I had no idea who this guy was, or that he was making films, or that he was terrific actor, AND squeezed the best performance ever out of a waning shyster of a movie-star Kevin Costner. What a great set of characters! It's a shame this film was kind of relegated to the chick flick section of the local video store, because I think a lot of guys will relate to Costner's Denny or Binder's shady radio producer character. And the females! Binder loves loves loves his females.. Just stunning character acting. See it for Costner, Joan Allen and Mike Binder's hilarious performance. If I didn't know Binder made the upcoming Reign Over Me, I would be the guy in the movie theatre snorting at those previews. But what can I say? I want to see it now!

Permalink",False,"I'm not a big fan of Costner .. his a good actor though .. the problem with Costner is that he make many movies and rarely chooses his best movies carefully. I haven't seen a good movie for him in a while .. to be exact since his western movie ""Open Range"".

His performance was good .. Joan Allen was awesome and they made a wonderful couple. I wish I can see them in other movies in the future.

The 4 girls (Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, Alicia Witt & Evan Rachel Wood) were good .. the length of the movie wouldn't help us to differentiate between them .. I got mixed up in the beginning .. they look a like and almost in the same range of years but the brilliant script introduces us to the girls individually .. it is the little the details here and there that helps us to recognize which one of the girls we are watching.

I felt they were truly a family .. so realistic acting by the girls as a team.

The director Mike Binder did a very good job.

I would like to go on & on about how good this movie is .. but I'm afraid I'll spoil some parts of the movie for the ones who haven't seen it yet.

It is not the best movie of the year .. but it is really good and deserves at least a watch."

A lot of family related movies,like Cheaper by the Dozen, or Family Stones...are comedy, but just follow the conventions...The Upside of Anger, however, with amazing actors, shows a loving/hating/revitalizing story that goes in our daily life...fantastic!

Since I rented it, I didn't know the year of the movie at the beginning. I thought it was made in 1993...ha-ha Yeah, so while watching it, I was amazed by the good quality of DVD...now I realize it was made in 2005 ha-ha still cool though

While the mom was the main character, she was self-absorbed but not too much not to notice the other characters appropriately. Kevin Costner was absolutely brilliant in this role -- the unshaven drunk with a conscience. His relationship with the female daughters seemed genuine and was extremely well done. The end of the movie was the best part. The movie is totally entertaining until a shocking and worthwhile, well-written ending. Worth 2 hours out of your life.

Permalink",False,"Joan Allen has one of her juiciest roles to date in ""The Upside of Anger,"" playing the neurotic mother of four daughters whose life is shattered when her husband leaves her for another woman. Like Aurora Greenway in ""Terms of Endearment,"" Terry seems to have been put on this earth to drive her children crazy. Yet, Terry also has reserves of strength, wisdom and common sense that can come into play when she isn't downing a pint of whiskey or trying to run the lives of everyone around her.

""The Upside of Anger,"" though it deals with serious issues of abandonment and resentment (and anger, of course), is, essentially, a warmhearted comedy that has some wise and witty things to say about the complexities of mother-daughter relationships. Terry has high expectations for each of her girls, so, naturally, she is a bit disconcerted when one of them chooses not to go to college and another hides the fact that she is pregnant and engaged to a man Terry has never even heard of let alone met. The screenplay by writer/director Mike Binder explores the tensions between Terry and her various daughters without ever becoming trite and predictable along the way. It's true that there could have been a bit more differentiation in the character of the four sisters; sometimes it's a little hard to tell who is who or what each of their particular goals or motivations are. But that's a minor complaint when the movie, as a whole, is so insightful and witty about so many aspects of life.

Conjuring up memories of ""Field of Dreams"" and ""Bull Durham,"" Kevin Costner returns to form in a low-keyed, understated performance as Denny, an ex pro-ball player and neighbor who develops romantic feelings for Terry. A fellow alcoholic, he manages to bring his own share of complications and baggage into Terry's already stressful life. (Denny serves a function very similar to the one provided by Jack Nicholson in ""Terms of Endearment"").

As fine as the other actresses portraying her daughters are, this is clearly Allen's film (and she has never looked as beautiful as she does here). She brilliantly conveys the many moods of a conflicted woman without ever once going over the edge or stepping out of character. She sinks her teeth into the role and never lets go. It's a virtuoso performance from one of the finest screen actresses of our time.

The film ducks more than one potential ""chick flick"" cliché in its search for the truth (even avoiding what would have been a major and truly disastrous parallel to ""Terms of Endearment""). The movie itself could have used a little more clarification at times, but Allen's glowing performance makes the whole thing worthwhile."

Permalink",True,"In a role tailor-made to her talents, Allen plays a well-to-do wife and mother who wakes up one day to find that her husband is gone. So is his attractive Swedish secretary! Allen goes from a fun, relatively carefree existence to a life of depression, heavy boozing and long bouts of self-pity. Her four daughters comfort her with varying degrees of supportiveness, though the eldest one (Witt) shares a combative relationship with her. Almost instantaneously upon her husband's flight, boozy former baseball star and neighbor Costner begins hanging around, trying to break through Allen's outer layer of anger and bitterness. He begins to win her trust in fits and starts while juggling his own set of issues. Meanwhile, the daughters experience their own joys and trials. Witt becomes engaged, Christenson refuses to attend college and becomes involved with an older man, Russell dreams of a career in dance and Wood has a somewhat unrequited crush on a young boy at school. Despite the episodic nature of the script, there aren't really a great many things going on. It's more a character study or an examination of the handling of disappointment in one's life (and the chance for renewal.) Allen is exceptional. She takes what could easily have been a sour apple part with little dimension and is able to turn it into a believable, even sympathetic, at times, character. She runs the gamut here from physical comedy to ""Mommie Dearest""-like tirades to tender interludes, always capturing the audience's attention and interest. It's unbelievable that she wasn't noticed by the major award bodies that year. Costner has one of his most appealing and ingratiating parts ever. Yes, he's a bit of a slob and a boozehound, but he's a likable, even vulnerable, lug. He and Allen share tremendous chemistry and he is elevated highly by his interaction with her. The girls (who, oddly, are cast with virtually no respect to their true ages, making it difficult at times to figure out who is at what stage in their schooling and life) have a certain amount of their story lines played out, but mostly they are there to compliment Allen and give her something to play off. The director (Binder) cast himself as Costner's loyal, but lascivious, buddy. He and Allen have an unforgettable encounter at the dinner table when he slurps his soup too loudly. Certain aspects of the film are far-fetched or implausible (and it's clearly meant to be a dark comedy), but there are also moments of truth and sensitivity within it. Astonishingly, though convincingly set in Detroit, practically the entire film was shot in and around London, England as a cost-saving measure.

Permalink",False,"Reviewers describe Joan Allen's character Terry Wolfmeyer in ""The Upside of Anger"" as ""furious,"" ""rage fueled"" and a ""control freak."" They also call her a ""lush"" and one stewing ""in a home brew of bile and vodka."" Although not as anger-fueled as many alcoholics (though snappy, nasty and sardonic, there's little outright screaming), for once the reviewers get it partly right. However, they don't seem to grasp cause and effect in attributing the behaviors to alcoholism. Nor does the movie itself, with the narration describing her as the nicest person anyone ever knew until anger turned her into a sad and bitter woman. The role of alcoholism in causing anger is not made clear; in fact, the uninitiated could easily conclude that the anger caused her drinking. It does not, and is one of many myths debunked in my book, ""Alcoholism Myths and Realities: Removing the Stigma of Society's Most Destructive Disease."" Terry suspects her husband has run off to Sweden with his secretary. We are to believe this is the cause of her heavy drinking and nasty behaviors. However, when she's trying to get her daughters off to school quickly (so she can have drinking buddy and sometimes boyfriend Denny Davies over for a little sex) by making them lunch, one says, ""You haven't done that in years."" When another daughter becomes seriously ill and is hospitalized, she tells her mother, ""You don't seem to care all that much about me, unless like now, when I'm sick...You need to pay more attention to me."" These two scenes suggest years of psychological abandonment in favor of the bottle.

The movie otherwise ignores the behaviors of early-stage alcoholism, leading to what is now a more obvious beginning of late-stage alcoholism. She pauses after pulling two bottles from a shelf at the market, yet still grabs a third. On the road, she flips off neighbors asking her to slow down. When one of her daughters asks if she's OK, she responds, ""No. I'm a wreck."" She describes her husband as ""a vile, selfish pig. But I'm not going to trash him to you girls."" Shocked that her eldest daughter is pregnant and marrying, upon meeting the groom's parents at a luncheon she says, ""I need a Bloody Mary as soon as it's humanly possible,"" and quickly downs two. In a comment inconsistent with euphoric recall (addicts often remember their behaviors in a self-favoring light), she admits to Denny after the luncheon, ""I made an ass of myself, like a public service film against drinking."" Denny, played by Kevin Costner, is a has-been former ""super sports"" baseball hero relegated to selling autographed baseballs and hosting a sports radio talk show in which he talks about cooking and gives stock tips. While Terry is a foul-mouthed drunk, Denny gets stoned while drinking beer, but never acts nasty, in yet another inconsistent portrayal of a likely late-stage alcoholic. (It's even possible Denny isn't one; he could simply be a sometimes heavy drinker who occasionally smokes dope who is down on his luck.) Terry's bottom seems to occur when she sees her daughter near death in the hospital, after which she walks past the vodka in the market. Denny's producer Shep (played by the movie's writer-director Mike Binder) runs into her and says, ""I should come over some night with a bottle and you and I should talk,"" to which she responds, ""I'm not drinking."" Shep is the likely undiagnosed alcoholic in the movie; he looks hung over in almost every scene and inflates his ego by seducing girls half his age (in my experience, few couples of widely disparate ages do not include at least one alcoholic).

The film's narration ends with the comment, ""anger and resentment can stop you in your tracks...The only upside to anger is the person you becomeanger, like growth, comes in spurts."" The implication is that if she hadn't been so angry, she'd have discovered her husband's whereabouts more quickly, and she wouldn't have been angry. This is incorrect. She is an alcoholic; anger, especially in the latter stages, goes with the territory."

Permalink",False,"This film is by all means one of the most poignant, realistic films that has ever been made. It was made with the intention to give us a single message, and it completely delivers it to us in the most fascinating way. Mike Binder achieved a masterpiece with 'The Upside of Anger'. The screenplay is wonderful. This movie is in every way funny, interesting, moving, affectionate, and sad. From the first scene to last, the movie grips you and it delivers. One of the biggest asset to the film is the acting. The actors are terrific. Joan Allen gives an outstanding performance as Terry Ann Wolfmeyer. At the beginning, Popeye tells us that her mother was at once a devoted, loving mother. Of course, life strikes (and it strikes hard for Terry) as her husband unexpectedly leaves her to fend for herself and four daughters. She turns alcoholic and engages in a intricate relationship with her neighbor, Denny Davies, another alcoholic baseball player. The film focuses in the three years of Terry and her daughter's life; they all face their dilemmas in different ways, and receive differently. Everything they do is affected by their father's disappearance, as they all, including Terry, are angry in their own ways. All the cast does an amazing job, and Kevin Costner at last gives us another performance to remember. Joan Allen, again, gives an amazing performance, which, I think, should have received at least an Oscar nomination--maybe even win. Beautiful film!"

Permalink",False,"Wow!!! Although the movie was slow at times, I found myself interested in all the characters involved. This has got to be the best film Kevin Costner has done since JFK way back in 1991. I have a new favorite actress and her name is Joan Allen. She brings a great performance that should have been nominated for an Academy Award. The four actresses who play the daughters were fleshed out characters, especially the youngest sister, played by Evan Rachel Wood who narrates this film. There is a plot twist I didn't see coming. When the daughter played by Keri Russell was sick, I thought back to the beginning and thought it was her funeral....it's not and that's the big surprise in this entertaining film.

By the way, my #1 film of 2005 was Brokeback Mountain.

Permalink",False,"This is a movie where I couldn't believe anything; everything was unexpected. First of all, it's directed by the ""sex monster"" Mike Binder, who I believe to be a pedophile or something close to it (no offense) because of the roles he chooses in the movies 'he writes'. Here, he proved it to me again by writing a character who gets sexually involved with a young girl.

Leaving that aside, unexpected was that I very much enjoyed his falling apart family tale. He wrote and directed a movie that's so good in all of its aspects that you forget the character he plays in it and everything he has done before. He deals with grown-up love (but really grown-up) showing the viewer what grown-ups do when they are in love; and it is childish some times, other times funny and even sad.

With a very uncommon team and alongside people that hadn't exactly worked for him before, Binder combined the elements to his convenience, demonstrating his talent as a director. A beautiful music by Alexandre Desplat and a wonderful cinematography by Richard Greatrex show some frames that seem spectacular and others that are too simple.

However, Binder found the secret in the performances (not in his, of course), or maybe in the performers. To play a story as peculiar as this one (a woman's husband leaves and she must face the lives of her four young daughters, besides dealing with a man who likes her; and not another word), the director needed convincing players: he found them.

I don't know if now, at their old age, actors decide to play drunken characters so they can highlight their acting qualities, because they think is better; and I don't know if each one of them is drunk onset all the timeBut it's working. Billy Bob Thornton did it in ""Bad Santa"" (drunk all the time) and he deserved an Oscar nominationKevin Costner, as Denny Davies, has done it here.

Costner doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination, and it's not my business if he was drunken onset all the time, because if he was, it helped the performance a lot. Denny is a former baseball star that couldn't re-launch his career, has a lame radio show and drinks all the time bothering his now single neighbor Terry Ann. Sometimes he watches television, sometimes he stays for dinner, sometimes he trespasses the limits (you'll see)

Terry Ann was just left by her husband, and she also drinksA lot. Joan Allen plays her in a moment of her career where she's getting a lot of recognition. She did two other films released last year, ""Off the map"" and ""Yes""; she's an actress worth watching these days, and her portrayal of Terry Ann is a tour-de force that was overlooked by the big awards, probably because they expect something even greater, or so I hope.

""My mother used to be the nicest woman"", Terry Ann's daughter Popeye, who speaks off screen, says at the beginning of the film. I talked about intelligent young actresses when I wrote about ""The Perfect Score"", and Evan Rachel Wood (""Thirteen""), who plays Popeye, is truly gifted and with a brilliant future ahead of her.

The film also has the excellent Erika Christensen, playing another one of the daughters; the one who wants great things and doesn't want to go to college. She argues with her mother, but not as much as Hadley (played studiously by Alicia Witt) and not even as much as Emily (a Keri Russel that only highlights when she fights Allen).

UnexpectedIn the end, the movie is much better than anything you would imagine, much different and complex. The twist is so unexpected that it hits youReal hard."

Permalink",False,"This film IS about Joan Allen and her character. Costner is Costner and always, generally enjoyable as he was here. All the girls were very good and I was surprised to see 'Felicity' in this one. I wondered what happened to her. However, this film is a 'lesson in living' if you are open to it. The denouement, the ending, and I am not going to discuss that here, took me by surprise completely and I loved it. It turns the film into an OH My God! and puts even more strength into Ms. Allen's

performance as a 'left behind' mother by a husband running off with his secretary to Sweden, Joan Allen with 4 daughters, totally, and I mean totally embittered. As Costner says in one scene, ""...a more ticked off woman I have never seen..."" (I am paraphrasing but close). Moreover, he is right. My enjoyment of the film is two fold: To experience Joan Allen in such a tremendous role and pull it off perfectly, as previously I have never seen her like this or even THOUGHT of her in this serious/bitter/extremely sad but yet held a deep love of life and for her children, and quite frankly she also held a glint of happiness way back deep in her eyes role depth. For me she was thrilling. The other mind-blower was that the person that wrote and directed had a main role in the film as a sleazy radio producer. Who would have thunk it? There are a lot of layers to this film, in particular the thread of the youngest"", you are just a kid what do you know"" daughter's awareness of life and how people perceive it. It's obvious as the film builds and unravels and is actually the subtext of the 'lesson' in this film. It deserves to be seen!"

Permalink",True,"""The Upside of Anger"" is on HBO repeatedly now, and I find myself watching parts of it whenever it's on. That doesn't mean it was a great movie. No- I just wait for the best moments (and there aren't too many to list here). The performances from Joan Allen and her ensemble of daughters is superb. And Kevin Costner's just, well, Kevin Costner. He was so overrated in the early to mid nineties, it's nice to see him in a film where he is a supporting character because a leading man he is not (unless you're talking about shoot-em-ups that go straight to video).

The best parts are when Joan Allen finds ""Shep"" (a washed-out, over-the-hill radio DJ) in bed with her 22-year-old daughter, played by Erika Christiansen. Allen's reaction is hysterical, and the scene which follows at the dinner table has flashed in every parents' mind when their child has a significant other they vehemently disapprove of. And later when she slaps Shep TWICE for being such a chickenhawk. Shep's comeback isn't earth-shattering, but he begins to deliver a point. However, he doesn't seem to be as articulate as Joan Allen's character I was nonetheless quietly hoping for more from him.

But the movie never seems to get over second gear, and has a weak climax. This is not necessarily a Lifetime movie, but it's tailored for it (just need to cut down- or out- the dinner table-scene); in where it seems to be a TV drama with sap included. The movie drags numerous times and I found myself tuning out.

Bottom line: if you want to see a good chick-flick out there, see one from a FEMALE director, not by a man.

Watchable but forgettable.

This is in reality an anti-feminist, anti-chick flic movie- almost a parody of the genre.

Remember Millionaire Baby? You thought that was going to be a guy film, but it was really a soap opera tear jerker set in a boxing gymnasium. This movie is the opposite. Admittedly, the first 90% of this movie is standard fare, but well done with some good lines. The story is about an upper-class suburban family whose Father suddenly runs off to Sweden with his secretary, leaving the mother bitter and alone to raise four daughters. Costner, a neighbor, turns first into her drinking buddy, and then a boyfriend as we cover next three years and watch the four daughter's growing up, dealing with their Mother's anger and their own adolescent problems.

Permalink",True,"it certainly was depressing. The movie begins at a funeral then jumps back 3 years. We are left wondering whose funeral was it. Terry Ann informs her daughters that their father has run of to Sweden with his secretary. And they act like they really don't care. She tells them she hasn't heard from her husband but that must be what happened. You'd think the daughters would at least try to track him down.

Terry Ann starts drinking a lot and is just depressed. She starts seeing, Denny, a neighbor who also hits the bottle. They get drunk and stay depressed together. Her daughters basically try to do what she doesn't want. One doesn't want to go to college. One wants to go to art school. One starts up an affair with a much older man. One informs her she is pregnant and getting married at her graduation. Terry Ann never knew she was even dating anyone.

Shep the sleeze who sleeps with Andy was actually sort of gross. I mean, she is supposed to be right out of high school and he is middle aged and her boss. Terry should have put him in his place a long time before she did.

Then there is the twist at the end. They find Terry's husband at the bottom of a hole. He must have fell through while out back of their house walking around. So, he had been dead the past 3 years. I thought she must have killed him and that's why she never tried to track him down. But, apparently not, it was just an accident.

FINAL VERDICT: Not to great. I just didn't care what happened to the characters.

Permalink",False,"Showing dimensions she has not been allowed to display before on screen, Joan Allen gives a fearless and fiercely comic performance as Terry Wolfmeyer, a suburban Detroit wife and mother of four daughters who apparently has been abandoned by her philandering husband. Director and screenwriter (as well as former stand-up comic) Mike Binder - who worked with Allen on 2000's ""The Contender"" playing her chief-of-staff - provides Allen with quite an explosive, warts-and-all showcase for her considerable acting prowess in this spirited 2005 comedy-drama.

The plot seems to be an amalgam of Paul Mazursky's 1978 breakthrough ""An Unmarried Woman"", a reverse-angle take on Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", and the quirky, ironic sensibilities of Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"". However, the themes that Binder espouses are intriguing in that he explores the unremitting torrent of anger one woman feels toward life when she discovers one day that her husband is gone. As Terry deals with her anger through alcoholic binges and canoodling with Denny, the retired pro baseball neighbor, she emotionally abandons her four daughters against her best efforts.

Played by Alicia Witt, oldest daughter Hadley just graduated college and becomes pregnant by an affable rich boy whom Terry describes as ""not intelligent"". Former ""Felicity"" star Keri Russell portrays aspiring ballet dancer Emily, who becomes anorexic and almost as angry as Terry. Evan Rachel Wood, superb in ""Thirteen"", plays youngest daughter ""Popeye"" (nicknamed for no explained reason), who provides the narration at the beginning and end through a class video project, while experimenting with drugs and developing a crush on a gay classmate. Rebellious Andy, portrayed by Erika Christensen, decides to get a job as a radio station production assistant rather than going to college. In the most nonchalant manner, she ends up sleeping with Shep Goodman, the sleazy producer who happens to be played by Binder. All four up-and-coming actresses are terrific within the confines of their roles.

However, I have to hand the prize to Kevin Costner, who seems finally freed of the self-absorbed heroic roles he has been playing. In what has to be his most insightful performance since 1988's ""Bull Durham"", Costner plays Denny with an élan he hasn't displayed in years. It is another baseball player role, but he infuses such humor, resignation and naked emotion into his gone-to-seed character, now a perpetually stoned disc jockey who patiently waits for Terry to see the ""upside of anger"", that sense of calm one feels in the end after all of the rage has been released. He does have a great moment when he kicks Terry's bathroom door down - rather than a romantic gesture, it summarizes the years of frustration in dealing with her paranoia and bitterness.

I also appreciate how Binder realistically treats their mutual alcoholism as a way of life rather than a TV-movie disease eating away at them. There are certain times when the movie does veer toward triteness, and Binder likes to use fantasy sequences to express unspoken feelings - such as when Shep's head explodes at the dinner table to Terry's satisfaction - which are effective though a little too convenient for my taste. While not in the league of ""The Sixth Sense"", the much-discussed twist ending really makes the film more a parable about the futility of anger. It's a creative move by Binder, though it obviously prevents him from exploring the true upside of anger since it would mean explaining some story lapses.

Nonetheless, this is Allen's show and she is amazing - whether collecting her husband's belonging with fury much like Jill Clayburgh did in ""An Unmarried Woman"", reacting with silent disgust as she catches Andy and Shep in bed, spooning hesitantly with Denny, ordering another Bloody Mary in front of her prospective in-laws or decking Shep twice at Hadley's wedding. The DVD includes the standard ingredients - eight deleted scenes that were understandably excised, a rather lengthy making-of featurette at over thirty minutes (although I was amazed to discover most of the film was shot in London to keep down costs), and an alternate audio commentary track by Allen and Binder, which is alternately insightful and self-congratulatory. There are also some DVD-ROM features like the shooting script."

Permalink",False,"The Upside of Anger is a very worthwhile human drama piece that nearly packs an emotional punch, but not quite.

Joan Allen plays a frustrated wife who's suddenly deserted by her husband, who leaves her to care for their children, who are all pretty much grown up anyway. Kevin Costner plays a friend of the family, an ex ball player with a drinking problem, who slowly manages to seduce Allen and the two start a relationship. It's not all smooth sailing, especially when Allen learns of her husband's whereabouts for all this time.

The one thing that works perfectly here are the performances by Allen and Costner. They truly elevate the movie and make it better than it actually is, particularly Costner who does his best work in years here. Other characters aren't as interesting, fairly one-dimensional and the surprise twist (which I wouldn't dare give away) not only comes as a total surprise, but it's one surprise the film didn't need. It's fairly illogical and really hurts the film.

The story could have used some more complications and gone deeper into some issues that are barely raised. But the script is well written and the film moves along smoothly.

Terms of Endearment this film is not but very acceptable on it's own terms. Don't expect too much and you might just enjoy it."

Permalink",True,"Only went to see it because my girlfriend wanted to go to it. But it turned out to be a great movie.

****SPOILER**** Especially when they found the father in the end of the movie, in the well. I didn't see that one coming.

Kevin Costner did one helluva job on this movie, in his role as Danny Davies, but had good help from Joan Allen.

The movie also had a good angle, the way the story was told, and how things developed.

My personal favourite would be when Spike's head blew up while they were having dinner

Permalink",True,"The DVD has a very interesting ""making of"" feature where the writer/director and cast talk about how this movie got made and, even though it is set in Detroit was mostly filmed in London and at Ealing Studios.

Mike Binder wrote and directed, and also plays the role of perhaps the funniest character in the movie, 40-something radio talk show producer ""Shep"" who is unashamed that he looks for young women half his age to seduce. There is a very funny dialog where he explains why. (""I'd rather have someone go up my butt every day to do dental work than have to put up with a bitter lady like you."")

Joan Allen is remarkable as Terry Wolfmeyer, middle aged mother of 4 pretty and smart high school and college daughters. As the movie begins in earnest we find that her husband has apparently vanished, she believes he ran off to Sweden with his secretary who quit just 3 days earlier. So the main of the movie is about Terry's difficulty coping with the anger that this brings, going around semi-drunk most of the time. The ""upside"" of anger is how everyone figures out better what they really want to do with their lives, thus the title.

Comic relief is brought by Kevin Costner who co-stars as friendly neighbor Denny Davies, former big league ball player who didn't do any planning for retirement and finds himself doing a daytime radio show, and autographs baseballs to supplement his income. We later find out that Denny always had a bit of a crush on Terry, and now with her husband gone he is very willing to become her drinking buddy. If something better develops, that's fine with him.

The daughters are played well by Erika Christensen (Andy), Keri Russell (Emily), Alicia Witt (Hadley), and Evan Rachel Wood (Popeye).

MAJOR SPOILERS. A running sub-plot is a developer we never see who wants to turn the land behind Terry's home into a new subdivision. Near the end of the movie, 3 years after it begins, while a worker is scouting the site, he almost falls through a rotting wooden structure and, looking down with a flashlight sees some remains. They fish out the wallet and it is Terry's long-gone husband. He didn't leave, he fell to his death. So the irony is that all of Terry's anger was misdirected, perhaps if she had searched for him immediately he might have been found alive. It is one of those ironies that life throws at us sometimes.

Permalink",False,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie. The acting of Joan Allen and Kevin Costner was outstanding, they did very well in their roles. Unfortunately, I found the storyline to be very disappointing.

Supposedly, the movie covers 3 years and Allen's character stays mad and unhappy the whole time. She has 4 older daughters and never allows any of them to express their anger or sadness that their father has abandoned them. Anytime anyone of them says anything to Allen she doesn't like, she reminds them to have pity on her, to understand her pain. What about the pain of the daughters? I understand that this movie was about the mother, but it wasn't realistic in how the daughters' roles were developed.

Also, the movie trailers made it look like there was more humor than there was. This was a tragic story. While I knew it wasn't a comedy, I expected more humor. All the funny parts were in the trailers.

Overall, a disappointing film."

Permalink",True,"I am a longtime fan of Mike Binder's stand-up from the days at the Comedy Store and his Make me Laugh appearance on TV. We used to see him in clubs with a young Jim Carey and David Letterman and I always thought he would make it big. I loved this film. I loved his show on HBO but this is a major move forward for him and a movie that is going to be recognized as one of the best of 2005. Kevin Costner and Joan Allen do career bests here and Binder and the daughters are great as well. THe script is tight and funny and real and the directing is so impressive. I can't say enough about this film. Get the DVD. The extras are all good and the commentary is really interesting. Binder and Allen and Rod Lurie are all really good together.

congrats to a guy that has been working hard for a Long time and is now I think going to go all the way.

His performance showed that he is back. I hope he stays like that! All three of Joan Allen's girls in the movie did a well done job too.

Mike Binder wrote, directed, and even starred in the film. He did a good job with this film. He should be recognized by the Oscars too with his fantastic film!

Permalink",False,"I keep wondering if the only people who write these comments are the ones who really enjoyed the movie. I noticed that other magazine and newspaper reviews generally gave it a ""good but not great"" rating. You know, the old ""B"" rating. Yet I and most of my fellow commentators rank it from eight to ten stars. I must be missing the point these other middle-of-the-road reviews keep making. I thought it was one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. But the humor wasn't based on slapstick situations, not even close. It was the humor of real people doing and saying things that were not intended to be funny but were hilarious. And Joan Allen, as the middle-age personification of anger, was simply great. I think she deserves an Oscar nod for this performance. Kevin Costner, as the aging semi-lush radio talk-show host, gave his best performance in a long time. I may even go see it a second time, just to remember what it once felt like to sit in a darkened theater and share loud and simultaneous laughter with my fellow audience members.

Permalink",False,"I was skeptical of the film at the beginning. It's one of those slow builders. I loved how every character has an arc, though, of course, Joan Allen's was the largest. I enjoy many of the films Kevin Costner is in, though I don't think he's the greatest actor out there. He does quite a fine job in this film. He played a completely new role, for him! There is guilty comedy (""should I really be laughing at this?""), and just plain, straight-forward, laugh-out-loud comedy - not to mention the magnificent, quiet drama. Joan Allen is a jewel in this! How could this be released so early in the year - and so far away from awards season? There should be at least one acting nomination and definitely a writing nomination. This is beautifully written. My time was well spent - I was entertained, took something away with me, and escaped my life for a while.

Permalink",True,"Half-way through this movie I realized that this is really about alcohol and it's ugly effects. When Popeye says ""Anger & resentment... at the end, these are the permanent pitfalls of the alcoholic. I am 14+ months sober, and this movie showed in it's subtlety how an already angry person can turn almost ""evil"" when under the constant influence. In her clouded thinking, she created a world for her husband that didn't exist. Paranoia, frustration, resentment, etc. fueled further her already shaky existence and poor relations with her daughters. But it does show that one can redeem oneself and come out on the other side. Or as Popeye alluded, there can be an upside of anger - to become a better person. I really enjoyed this movie. Great to see Costner in a role again where he gets to be likable.

Permalink",False,"Being smart and freshly done, The Upside of Anger has the audiences crying, and laughing along. Joan Allen brilliantly plays a woman who believes her husband has left her for his Sweedish secretary. Her four girls, Hadley, Emily, Andy and Popeye are upset both by their father's disappearance and their mother's reaction to the heartbreak. In comes Costner, perfect timing, as Denny, an ex-baseball player who SHOULD be doing the sport broadcast for the local radio station but instead prefers giving out cooking tips to his listeners. Denny is able to help Teri (Allen) get over her heartbreak and becomes the father figure to her girls. They are all there for one another through the good times and the bad, through the boyfriends and the hospital visits. This story is one of the greatest family movies that I have seen in a long time. This movie was the best I have seen so far this year, and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD so I can watch it over and over again!!! Go see this movie if you want an instant boost in the heart!
