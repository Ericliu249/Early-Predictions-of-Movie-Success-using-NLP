Permalink",False,"This movie stands out from any movie I've ever seen for one reason: it is the only movie I've seen where I believed the people fighting were actually fighting. I can't remember ever seeing a film where I was actually wincing and tensing up from fear that somebody was going to get hurt.

This isn't a film that depends on CGI or fast cuts or clever angles or even stunt people for the most part. The star of the film is clearly a very physical and capable woman of action, and she made me believe she was actually hurting the people she was pretending to hurt.

For that reason alone, it will always stand out in my memory. Most action films these days are terribly boring because it's all so cartoonish and exaggerated and stylized, and therefore unbelievable and fake. But this film kept the action grounded in the physical capabilities of its very capable star, and that made it anything but boring. I guess it didn't do to well at the box office, which is too bad. If this had launched a franchise I'd have been a big fan."

Permalink",False,"Haywire is directed by Steven Soderbergh and features an all star cast that includes Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender.

However the main star is MMA fighter Gina Carano as Mallory Kane who works in black ops and is hired to pose as he wife of a British agent and ends up being a target for elimination herself. Carano has to unravel who is trying to set her up.

The film is shot with little dialogue and a moody setting, many of the known cast has small roles and its a 'unHollywood thriller' although Carano does get to kick ass as well as getting chased mainly in the streets or rooftops of Dublin.

Fassbender and Carano's scenes standout especially their combat sequences. Its an unusual film given the director is an Oscar winner 'A' lister director who has gone back to his roots and decided to make an independent action film. By and large he succeeds and Carano looks like someone, given the right material who could breakout as an action star."

Permalink",False,"Once again, I stepped into a movie with zero expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. People told me to avoid ""Haywire"" but I found it reasonably entertaining.

First off, I was amazed by the number of likable actors that are in the movie - Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas and Bill Paxton (where has he been hiding?) all star in co-roles. I don't know the main actress in the movie but she did a fine job, and apparently did all her own stunts.

Flick has been un-fairly compared to Angelina Jolies ""Salt."" Why? Because it stars a woman kicking guys ass's perhaps? I guess their plots are kind off similar too, but ""Salt"" was an over the top action movie. Outside of a couple of movie-style fights ""Haywire"" feels more realistic, but where it really succeeds is in its style. It works as a cool thriller that I found myself smiling at because off the way it tells its ex-assassin-getting-chased-again plot. Although maybe not everyone will give it a thumbs up, I will because I enjoyed it."

Permalink",True,"I've literally just seen this and came out of the cinema thinking 'Was that it?'. OK, the fight sequences were good, an easy rival for the likes of Bourne, and the occasional one line comments did make me chuckle but the acting, especially from the lead character, was pretty poor. I even expected more from the likes of Douglas, McGregor and Fassbender!

The general plot was there and developed over what seemed like 3 hours, however I felt the film was disjointed, predictable, and why she insisted on befriending a random bloke and telling him her entire life story after stealing his car is beyond me.

All in all I felt cheated, let down, and like I was watching a well budgeted university film.

Permalink",False,"It's got a simple, but hugely unoriginal plot - Special Ops agent gets doubled-crossed (yawn) and proceeds to exact her revenge on those who wronged her, yeah, it sounds very much like the standard plot for your average Steven Seagal straight-to-DVD actioner - not a film directed by Steven Soderbergh!

I suspect that Soderbergh is not overly familiar with this particular genre, otherwise he might have avoided the clich√©d script like the plague...

The direction for this piece is restrained almost to the point of inertia - any energy generated within the action scenes comes sorely from the mixed-martial artistry of Ms. Carano, it almost feels as if Mr. Soderbergh is embarrassed by the notion of directing an action thriller.

Soderbergh does his usual thing of peppering his films with stars and/or solid character actors, but despite the presence of the likes of Ewan MacGregor, Michael Fassbender, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, etc, they are underused in what are essentially expanded cameos - only MacGregor gets to shine a little, but his character is underwritten and lacks any credible motivation for his actions.

Gina Carano acquits herself quite well, especially so given the fact that she is carrying the movie on her inexperienced shoulders - that and the cold, hard reality that her character is basically a Jason Bourne clone, albeit with female genitalia...

The film also suffers from the fact that it doesn't have a climax, it just simply stops.

The restrained approach Soderbergh adopted for this film is it's undoing - short, sporadic bursts of action in an uninspired and leisurely-paced script damage Haywire badly, if Steven Soderbergh had bothered to have injected a bit more zest and flair into his direction, the film might have been redeemed somewhat and not turned into the lifeless, miserable clone that it is.

PG."

Permalink",False,"The story of Haywire is not really appealing. It's about someone tough who got betrayed then wants revenge. It's been used in so many action films. But Haywire has a different purpose to exist. It's about giving Gina Carano her own show with Steven Soderbergh's direction. It's pretty fascinating. Both merits cover the ""cookie-cutterness"" of the plot. It's not your standard action film with senseless explosions and mediocre dumbness. It's a film with art, style, and action scenes that are ridiculous and realistic. It's short but it's still worth the ride.

The film isn't really trying to be original, big, or loud. Haywire is one of Soderbergh's experiments. The story may not be original but he tells it in a pretty clever way. The first half of the film takes place on a car and shows a lot of flashbacks. The scenes are pretty slick. The action is silent but it's pretty awesome. Gina Carano made every fights dangerously exciting. The other stars does their thing but they don't appear that much. It's one of Soderbergh's trademarks. He casts some big stars but they end up being minor characters. Well, this is Carano's show. It's all about her.

The only thing that disappoints me here is it's too short and there are only few fight scenes. But there are still some action scenes that are pretty exciting like the car chase in New York and the SWAT chase in Dublin were well shot and have a good amount of suspense. The rest of the filmmaking: Well written. The score is fancy. The cinematography and editing are simply art.

Haywire is as simple as it gets. It may not be a fast action blockbuster but it is more interesting than that. It's not quite recommendable to everyone unless you like art films, Soderbergh's directing style, or Gina Carano. No female action star can fight like Gina Carano. It's fun to see her beat up all of these men. Since we are now stuck with action films with mediocre filmmaking, at least we get to see another classy action film like this. But the true core of this film is Gina Carano."

Permalink",False,"A lot of people are just voting 1 for this film without any just cause other then they don't want to like this film. I believe this film has flaws but as a whole, is a very unique and special experience. When I watched this film, it was not like any film that I had seen before, from the camera angles, sound choices, etc. I felt some of the sound choices were strange but it went with the whole flow of the movie. This movie is NOT a standard action movie but more like watching art. There were few fight scenes but the fight scenes that are in the movie have a raw feeling to them and are extremely well choreographed. They are believable because the main character's hand to hand fights are all one on one with the exception of one fight in which she is fighting two people. But it is believable because she gets a surprise attack on the two people. The other fights, she is fighting people her size except for one fight, in which she was getting her ass handed to her until someone else joined in and helped her.

I think people were either expecting an ACTION action movie or a Oscar worthy drama but this movie is neither. It has a very surreal feeling and it can be slow but it has a very real feeling to it as well and is more like an experience then a movie. The fight scenes alone are worth the price of admission, and seeing the birth of a legitimate female action star. Was her acting stellar? No but it was pretty good, especially for someone who has never acted before. She can only improve from here."

Carano is great in her role, totally believable and the girl does her own stunts! The story is a bit hard to follow so you do have to pay attention and have a normal adult attention span. If you are expecting ""Fast and Furious"" or some other schlock like that, this is not the movie for you. There are intense action scenes and slower parts where the story really unfolds. All of the male stars in this film are simply backdrop for Gina's kick ass, don't f**k with me fellows attitude. A very unique and intelligent story worth seeing.

Permalink",False,"Sharp, uncomplicated, and thrilling, 'Haywire' packs its punches quite effectively. The gloomy tone, the serious setting, the unapologetically aggressive fight sequences; this is an unusual action drama.

From the initial confrontation scene to the movie's comic ending, there isn't a single dull moment in it. The list of talented male actors involved is endless - Tatum, McGregor, Douglas, Banderas, Fassbender, Paxton. But it's the athletic and talented female lead, not-so-known Gina Carano, who carries the movie forward. She's like the female Bourne. I wonder why she hasn't done more movies.

The action sequences between Carano and the male actors are uniquely brilliant; the male and the female punch, hit and kick each other with the same amount of raw brutal force, which is not usually seen in movies. In that regard, the movie is quite feminist, in my opinion. And the fact that no sound effect or background score is used during the fight scenes make the sequences feel more real and effective.

The editing is tight, the camera-work is beautiful, the background score is minimal, and the story doesn't try too hard to be complex, which makes the movie an exhilarating ride."

I would very much like to see a sequel to this one. It would be interesting to see Gina's character evolve furthermore. It's good to see a tough female action character, and knowing what she can do in real life mixed martial art battles makes her character even more convincing. The character that Gina Carano plays in this movie is very focused and professional (as she should be in this kind of job). All in all I think it is very entertaining and all the characters are well played.

Permalink",True,"I was really looking forward to see this movie, because i like Jina Carano and love thrillers and action films. But Haywire is just bad. Weird colors and sound choices, supposed to add suspense but they didn't. Fights, that looked like sparring, because there were no strong punches and power in the moves. All the strikes and grips because of this looked fake. Overall bad and unconvincing action - chases were about mindless running, there were nothing special about them, despite all the tries.

I wish my English allowed me to explain it better, but i will do my best: if you, as a director, want something (fight or running scene) to look real, it would be wise to do some research, otherwise you will get really poor result. For example, in the Barcelona chase Jina's bottom was wobbling - nobody runs like this in the real life if he was in army, because, you know, everything you do in the army is running. It's just looks unprofessional and fake. Script is on same level of quality - huge conspiracy with big plot holes. Just bad movie.

Permalink",True,"This is a vehicle for former MMA star Gina Carano, ably supported by Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender and Antonio Banderas. Despite probable debut nerves, Gina handles herself quite well in such celebrated company. Like Tinker, Tailor... the film is not about acting charisma but focused on the story and all the characters just serve to push it along. The plot is a fairly standard blackops agent set up and the scene is nicely set for the sequel it probably deserves. Does Kenneth actually die? Before killing him, does Mallory extract shocking new information from Rodrigo (or does his new wife even manage to save him)? Does she go after Studer next and bring down his crime syndicate? And is Coblenz as innocent as he makes out, or just using her to clean up a trail that actually leads back to him? These are all loose ends that could be exploited before one even bothers to think up a new adventure, whether working for the government or independently. Good luck with that Gina :o)

Permalink",False,"Better than Ocean 13 perhaps, but still quite bad. Gina Carano did so much better than John Cena. Too bad the director was Soderberg and not an 'actually' intelligent man. IMDb published an interview of Antonio Banderas on Haywire, but I wonder why. His screen time is less than 5 minutes in total, and not the most interesting 5 minutes either. Reasons are not explained, characters are not detailed, it is not a respectable film overall. Some people called Mallory the female Bourn. That is another mystery, because when I saw the world through Bourn's eyes, I never had any problem understanding what he was feeling or going through. In this film, I had no attachment with any of the characters. If the bad guys just killed Gina Carano in the middle of the film, I would not really feel any different, because I had no idea why a bunch of people were just randomly hurting, shooting at, or killing each other. I read a review a while back, where someone criticized those who came to watch this film expecting a real action film or some award- winning performances. He wrote he liked this film honestly because of the surreal feel. I can kind of appreciate his remark. Surrealism and retardedness are two extremes that can sometimes cross over from one side to the other. For mentally healthy people, who expect to see female Bourn with stylish performances from McGregor, Banderas, Fassbender, etc., I do not recommend this film at all. The film is well shot, well edited, the soundtrack is not too horrible, so I give it a 5. If I had to rate only the substance, I would rate it 1, like many others have done."

Not a single character is developed throughout the movie, and for the most part it is just a series of bland discussions that are pointless until the end of the movie. This isn't a Fight Club or Usual Suspects twist ending either, it is just simply a recap of what had happened. While the plot is bad it is hardly the worst part of the movie. Some of the action scenes are just incredibly boring. While I wasn't expecting a well developed plot going into this movie, I did expect good action sequences. Whether it was the car chase where she is driving backwards at about 5 miles per hour, or the stupid sprint on the beach it was astoundingly boring. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

Action - -_- at no point was i even close to the edge of my seat in this film. the fighting is decently choreographed but nothing special whilst everything else was boring and predictable. Real low point was a chase scene on roofs where she did nothing that i am not capable of. I've seen more impressive things on youtube.

Music - this has to be mentioned simply because its annoying as hell.

Overall i'm glad to see the ratings of this film falling. I only wished i'd looked at these reviews a few hours later. I could have saved a tenner.

Permalink",False,"For the number of movies Soderbergh already made (and most of them really good), he proved to be an eclectic director, traveling thru all kind of genres effortless, delivering alternative approaches without getting so much away of the mainstream. He makes American movies but for a different American audience, and sometimes Hollywood movies but for those who want something a little different from the obvious. And that way Soderbergh proved to be one of the top directors of his time, but that is also his main problem because people usually overrate his movies a lot.

He made a huge campaign about Haywire, stating that his decision to make this action movie is for the fact that great action movies wasn't being produced anymore. And ""great action movies"" for him is those Chuck Norris-ish ones with a real bad ass action star able to make an entire scene without stunts or so many edition tricks. So he met MMA fighter Gina Carano, and so he decided to make a movie specially for her. He also stated that he wanted to make a kick ass movie with a female leading different from the others while most of action movies use their sexuality more than their fighting skills. He succeeds. Gina Carano's expertise really dismiss stunts and the results are intense and realistic scenes.

Being an MMA fighter, Gina Carano delivers a fair performance, but of course that she is better fighting than acting.

The movie gives what it promises and Soderbergh tries to keep the actions scenes focused entirely on the fighting performances and chasing sequences never using soundtracks or gun shots more than the necessary to not overshadow all the technical attention he so wanted to experience. And it works, but not entirely. For ordinary audience the movie may not be what they seek and that may be frustrating.

The plot is extremely predictable and common: an agent that has been betrayed and now has to clean up all the mess to get back a normal life she so desperately want. And we know Soderbergh a lot, and we know that he makes huge twists and turns over a simple plot just to give the false impression that his movies aren't brainless.

Anyway... I admire his efforts to bring back old technical visions into his movies, but Haywire doesn't get off so much of the line as he so hardly stated. Still being a great action movie, and like Hanna (2011), it is not an action movie for ordinary audience and ordinary action lovers."

This is of course a change of pace for Soderberg who is actually becoming known for his ability shape-shift between genres and do a pretty good job at each one he chooses.

This is an average spy thriller lifted to above-average by an A-List cast backed by Gina Carano in the action scenes.

Carano is the actual reason I wanted to review the film. She is a rarity in modern film, a good looking actress who shows not the slightest hesitation at going all JCVD on someone's butt if the script demands it.

And she is good. I mean there are multiple scenes here where she carries the attention of the viewer and it is hard to imagine another actress doing that as well.

The unfortunate part is that it seems no one in Hollywood wanted to accept the challenge of moving her career along even though it deserved to be moved. I watched her in IN THE BLOOD, a later effort framed as a B movie and lacking all the class and polish in this one.

Too bad. I miss her already."

Permalink",False,"According to what I read (or should I say waded through), Steven Soderbergh saw Gina Carano fight (she is an expert in martial arts) and wanted to build a film around her.

Haywire isn't your typical Soderbergh film. The plot is barely there -- a black ops agent is betrayed and seeks revenge on her betrayers. Big whoop. The star of the show is Gina Carano kickboxing, jumping, throttling people, you name it. That is one amazing athlete there. And the fact that she was up against all men was impressive. And she has a great figure.

The film also stars Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, and Ewan McGregor, so the inexperienced Carano was surrounded by good people who didn't have much to do.

This isn't an action film up to the standards of a Bourne film, due to Soderbergh not doing much in the way of directing. It just doesn't pop. The ending is just blah.

Permalink",False,"Steven Soderbergh has a reputation for directing films that are great, weird or anywhere in between. You can, however, always depend on the right pieces to be in place, as he has a devoted following of A-list actors who agree to star in everything he does. With Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender in supporting roles, ""Haywire"" certainly has a large part of the equation covered in order to work, but it falls decidedly in the ""anywhere in between"" category.

MMA fighter Gina Carano is the foundation around which ""Haywire"" attaches its many Oscar- caliber ornaments. A fresh-faced action star padded with so many superb talents, Carano automatically rises to the top of this vanilla action-thriller concoction. Despite some really wooden line delivery in a number of scenes, she's got action star chops, and her character, contracted black ops agent and ex-marine Mallory Kane, isn't treated differently for being female.

""Haywire"" isn't quite by-the-numbers as far as modern post-Bourne special agent action- thrillers go (nothing by Soderbergh ever is), but it places all its novelty in Carano's hands. She's an entertaining watch, but she's not going to take generic material and make it awesome ‚Äî no one's that talented.

Lem Dobbs' screenplay isn't really a problem, as plenty of films in the genre have been made out of worse, but neither he nor Soderbergh make an argument for why you should watch ""Haywire"" instead of another movie (or even another viewing of any ""Bourne"" film) other than to see all the stars that have been collected to play minor characters.

""Haywire"" follows a classic betrayed agent looking for revenge premise. Mallory is an asset working for a private ops contractor named Kenneth (McGregor) who is thinking about getting out. The film opens after he's betrayed her and left her for dead in Dublin, and she's set to meet with him in upstate New York, except he sends her coworker, Aaron (Tatum), who attacks her in order to bring her in. She breaks his arm and escapes in the car of a random person at the diner (Michael Angarano) and tells him the whole story of her betrayal as she flees.

Soderbergh downright refuses to follow some of the most fundamental conventions of the action genre in this film, which keeps ""Haywire"" fresh but ultimately renders it somewhat stagnant. The trade off for avoiding something stylistically generic is depriving the audience of some of the usual tactics of action films to engage and maintain interest. With a short run time, ""Haywire"" never gets too boring, but it does at times feel flat.

The technique Soderbergh uses that stands out the most involves flipping the traditional use of scoring in an action film. Whereas most movies use silence to build suspense and then use music to underscore the intensity of an action sequence, Soderbergh does the opposite: he enlists David Holmes (of the ""Ocean's"" films) to create synthetic-sounding '70s action music leading up to action confrontations and then cuts the sound completely to make the fighting feel more raw and natural. It has an interesting effect that manages to work in the fight scenes, but it sets an awkward tone for the build-up given how dated the music sounds.

The hand-to-hand (or I should say foot-to-throat) combat scenes we get are rather exciting with this raw presentation, and it suits Carano well given her talents before she decided to try acting. She is definitely beautiful, but she's not lady-like, and as you watch her you aren't distracted by her sex. The point is that it would be wrong to categorize her as a femme fatale or anything we've previously seen in this genre. She's an action star and she earns it here.

Solid is one and perhaps the most applicable of the many unremarkable yet reputable adjectives one could use to describe ""Haywire."" Its detractors will likely come from disappointment over potential rather than poor filmmaking and considering the names on the poster, it's not an unwarranted complaint. One could also argue that without the level of pedigree, the material wouldn't warrant any attention but the bargain bin. Best, then, to attribute to ""Haywire's"" lack of being special to some miscalculation on all fronts. Fortunately, it's quite tolerable nonetheless.

Director Steven Soderbergh doing an action flick starring a real MMA fighter, what is there not to like about HAYWIRE?! Plus it's written by Lem Dobbs who gave us Soderbergh's old great film, The Limey. You want another reason to like HAYWIRE? How 'bout this, the supporting actors are A-list names who are on top of their game. O and did I mention that Gina Carano kicks serious ass because unlike skinny Saldana or Jolie, Carano can literally kick your ass. Action film doesn't get more grounded and more solid than HAYWIRE..

Steven Soderbergh is one of those filmmakers who I can easily trust, by that I mean whenever I hear there's a film made by Soderbergh, you can count me in because I know I'll be treated with good stories handled by a master who always aims to dig deeper and find those extra layers. I wasn't too crazy about Contagion but that was mostly because the film bit off more than it could chew. I personally don't find Dobb's HAYWIRE script to be too complex, I actually find the whole thing a bit thin, but it's not too simple that it might insult your intelligence. You could see the pawns in this chess game, who's pulling the strings, which one has more power over the others, beware the quiet ones, but the story fits nicely in between one action sequence after another. They mean to design HAYWIRE as a throwback to old James Bond films but I think HAYWIRE has enough kicks to be taken as an original espionage thriller.

What I appreciate about HAYWIRE is that it's not an over-the-top, excessive, CG-laden action film. Other films brag about being grounded in reality, I think HAYWIRE can shut their mouths because for the most part of the film, what you see is what you get. And no offense to Statham's beating up 50 guys at a time, which is excitingly far-fetched, but what Carano's character Mallory Kane offers is a more creative set of fighting styles, and the result is a very realistic choreography, each fight doesn't drag, often times it's just one, two move and done. Little to no acrobatic wire work and lavish special effects. The action in this film is physically possible. I think it's brilliant that Soderbergh chooses to not have any music accompany the fight sequences, there's music for the car chases and the dramatic scenes and when shots are fired but as soon as the fights start, all you see and hear are the fights. Brilliant!

I'm saving the best part for this last paragraph, Gina Carano. What a revelation! Finally, a convincing, believable female action star who can also look elegant and beautiful. At first I was a bit concerned knowing that I'd be watching a film where a bunch of guys, famous guys I might add, were punching and kicking a woman. But after researching more on Carano, I became more concerned for the guys instead. Actingwise, I think Carano does a fine job, she looks like a fast and disciplined learner, she holds her ground when facing such giants as Banderas and Douglas who've been in the business for years. Carano is sexy and lethal. My favorite scene would have to be the brutal hand-to-hand combat between Carano's character, Mallory Kane and Michael Fassbender's character, Paul, in the hotel room. It's intense, chaotic, and thrilling. The first fight scene with Tatum is just as badass because you never know how far they'd hurt each other. But I'm sure that being a fighter, Carano finds all that to be her comfort zone. I hope we'll see her in more action films because she has what it takes, her future is bright in cinema.

Permalink",False,"People comparing this to the Bourne movies must have never seen any other spy movies. The premise is totally different and Gina Carano isn't some specially engineered super-spy. She just kicks ass. She's great in this movie. She's cute and sexy and a totally believable action hero. It's obvious she is doing a lot of her own stunts and fight work. I actually would've preferred a franchise with her over the Bourne movies who's premise was played out by the end of the first installment.

I'm not a real fan of Soderbergh but in this case his restrained approach worked. If you like espionage-action-thrillers, where you're constantly wondering who is on whose side, this will entertain you.

Permalink",False,"I'm really sad to see how underrated this movie is. I am always looking for action movies I haven't seen, that are just proper, (doesn't even have to be good, just watchable), so having bad reviews for really good movies like this one just prevent people like me to miss such good ones.

This movie has very good acting, a fine script, and a lot (really a lot) of action.

Another thing I like about the movie is that the main character is a real woman, fixing her own problems, not depending on men to do everything for her. (Just like most women are in real life?)

As today (almost) every new action movie is a Marvel or DC super hero movie, if you are looking for some old-school action , this one is a good choice. It is a bit like John Wick series, (but not as good), still a good one to watch at home lying on the sofa. If you are not expecting to be a better, wiser or smarter person, or make the world a better place just by watching a film, and just to have fun, this one is definitely a good choice.

If you are a person that watches every movie trying to understand what is the symbolism there, what does the director want to say in that scene, is that a reference to this culture object over here etc, then simply don't watch this film, because this one is not a ""that kind of movie."""

Permalink",False,"I don't know where to begin, it was just awful. Reviews with a negative base are never taken seriously or noted as helpful but I am here to tell you DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! There has been so much praise and hype about this movie its mind boggling. I enjoy an action movie, heck I even enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's movie ""Contraband"". Gina Carano simply cannot act. Not even a little bit. I heard they reedited her voice for the movie and for the life of me I can't imagine it was worse then it is now. The scenes were painfully long and incredibly slow. The fighting was predictable and terrible. Now let's talk about the movie.

The movie starts with Gina, a special op for hire, meeting a colleague for some unspecified covert meet and some nondescript diner. After some Thoroughly confusing double talk, a fight ensues. This quick action and actually decent fight scene gets ones hopes up that we may be in store for a good movie quickly deteriorates to the dumbest escape scenes ever. This entails hijacking a random car with a guy who she proceeds to tell her out of Sequence life story to. The storytelling is fractured and set in a 70's kind of vibe and feel, very similar to ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" but not remotely as successful.

I could bore you with details about how there's a double cross and she wants to get even with everybody, but why? The movie is packed with stars and directed by Soderbergh and can't manage to be watchable. With low expectations I was still brutally disappointed. Do yourself a favor if you must see it¬Öwait till redbox. Even then it will suck but you'll only be out $1.50 for Blu-ray."

Why does an agent go to mission with real name and everybody knows about her family history, who her dad is, where he lives, what he does, and still make a nice scene with him when they want her dead. It doesn't even look like an action movie, action scenes make you feel ashamed for their quality. The storyline is hilariously stupid. I am absolutely disappointed by my time being wasted, can't even understand how McGregor, Douglas, Banderas & Tatum agreed to play in a movie like this.

Permalink",False,"Haywire is about a female special ops agent who has been set up while on a mission, and her effort to get herself out of any more trouble for she's still being chased. The film covers the story usually back and forth with many agents involved. Gina Carano and her fighting skills have been chosen for the leading role, alongside an interesting supporting cast such as Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum, Bill Paxton and Michael Fassbender. Nevertheless, the film is moving around Carano's character. Douglas and McGregor seemed to play a decorative part and Banderas is charming his way through, while Tatum and Fassbender get their ass kicked pretty well! Don't expect jaw dropping performances because mostly it's all about the action.

The outcome looked like a Richie-Tarantino attempt. Lots of action and mystery with a little bit of sarcasm and a weird selection of music. Not bad (David Holmes in charge), but at a few points it just seemed that it didn't match the scenes.

A nice action film. No need for high or low expectations. Steven Soderbergh is just trying stuff. Enjoy!"

Permalink",False,"It has more brutal action scenes than Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. It has a female lead hotter than the one of Battle: LA (in fact, Michelle Rodriguez is probably the best actress who Gina Carano can be reasonably compared to) who provides a better leading performance than Zoe Saldana in Colombiana. And it is boasting a better cast than Cowboys and Aliens - Haywire is arguably the best piece of filmmaking in the action genre in recent memory.

This could obviously be expected by Steven Soderbergh, still one of America's most consistent directors. His film has a brain and utilises it and this experimentation of the action genre is a unique one, especially in the superbly engineered action scenes. He has avoided to use background music as an intensifier and it works, giving the action scenes a very high level of brutality as every fist impacting the human body is heard. And he has avoided the shaky cam technique as an intensifier simply because there's no need. It's brutal enough without the standard exhilarating background music.

The stellar cast of this action picture have rewarded his direction with brilliant performances, Gina Carano in particular as aforementioned. They empower the story of a gutsy, fearless, ass-kicking woman determined to avenge herself even with a loss of trust for anyone willing to take her side after the double-crossing and the small amount of genuine help.

The plot itself is told in a disjointed way which is honestly a criticism to be made of the film because I believe that it will leave several people scratching their heads for some time during their viewing experience. But if you can get your head around it, and should really be able to once you complete the pieces of the puzzle, you will have experienced an intelligent action thriller from an intelligent director. A great start to the new year.

Watch it if: you like new takes on genres; willing to view something with a brain (especially if you just saw something stupid like New Years Eve recently); are a fan of Steven Soderbergh and his smart direction; looking to begin your 2012 cinema experience with something good. Don't watch it if: you expect something on the same scale of blockbuster action as MI4/Sherlock Holmes 2."

Permalink",True,"Mallory Kane is good enough at her 'private contracting' work that clients ask for her specifically, but she's planning to leave the company after the withering of a relationship with her boss. He finds a tidy way to solve the problems her departure will cause, while fulfilling an eight-figure contract with a governmental client. As he says with an amused smile, ""it's about money. It's always about money."" And his plans for her are unpleasantly final. But she's too perceptive to be taken by surprise. . .

Haywire is Steven Soderbergh's extremely crisp, intelligent take on the world of private intelligence contractors operating in the shadowy world linking governments, dissidents, and national intelligence organizations. and one employee's discovery that she's the target of a duplicitous employer. Soderbergh's directorial skill draws an excellent performance from Gina Carano, in her first role, as a focused operative with a phenomenal skill in hand-to-hand combat. She may be tightly-wound - a bemused colleague (Channing Tatum) asks ""Is that your idea of R&R? Wine and firearm maintenance?"" - but she knows how to navigate the murky world of international espionage with the right proportion of expertise and scepticism. She's able to deal with the duplicity of her superior, Ewan McGregor, and earn the supportive trust of government administrator Michael Douglas. Soderbergh's talent for helping character become real in the landscapes of his films makes Haywire a gripping exploration of how to navigate the duplicity inherent in worlds where morality is superseded by the profit motive.

Permalink",False,"I like espionage-y action thrillers. And the Bourne movies have breathed new life into the genre with a more realistic fight scene ethic (more realistic than quick-cut edited shlock, not actually REALISTIC). So it was great to see Stephen Soderbergh do his own take on a Bourne-ish movie.

Soderbergh is a genuinely excellent director - I absolutely loved The Limey, Contagion was superb in its attention to medical detail, and he's done a number of quite different and usually good films over the years. So for me, ""Haywire"" was a pleasure from start to finish. Exceptional cinematography and pacing; a nice twisty back-stabbing plot in exotic locales (parkour on the rooftops of a soggy Dublin!); and some heart-stopping fight sequences and stunts.

There are - as others have commented - some well-known actors in this flick turning in highly enjoyable performances, but the unknown Gina Carano is actually rather excellent too. She's out-acted by most of the other veterans (although not that woodentop Channing Tatum), but she's pretty good nevertheless. And she can really FIGHT. I mean, properly fight. Check her bio, and you will understand why.

I thought the big fight scene between her and the always excellent Michael Fassbender was one of the best I've seen since John Cusack and Benny ""the Jet"" Urquidez kicked the crap out of each other in Grosse Pointe Blank.

There's a decent plot going on in the background, but you have to pay attention and listen to the dialogue. And it doesn't have a slam-bang action sequence inserted every 3 minutes for the ADHD generation, so it's probably been downvoted by a lot of people raised on a steady diet of Bourne and Bad Boyz II. Ignore them, and watch this gem of an action movie. I doubt Soderbergh will make something like this again - he rarely seems to do retreads."

Permalink",False,"The premise while highly unimaginative must have seemed relatively risk- free since the cast was easily solid enough to procure funding as well as solidify some pre-production International distribution deals, which these days almost guarantees a ""green light"" in tinsel-town, but honestly... really?... Did the final cut honestly test well enough to warrant a nation-wide release? Denial it seems, has infected the source.

If you are over the age of 18 and partially educated, you probably won't enjoy this movie. The dialogue is truly quite painful to hear made only worse by the feeble mumbling Channing Tatum (who, btw I normally truly enjoy as an entertainer in titles such as: Step Up, She's the Man, etc., but let's be honest- he shouldn't be allowed to have more than 4 words per line.) and the ""Britney Spears""-quality delivery of Gina Carano (who genuinely does a fantastic job in terms of stunts and choreography, but her quasi-expressionless face (while pretty) and vacant eyes have none of the stage presence of a Matt Damon).

The horrible dialogue is tragically enhanced (in a bad way) by the irritatingly awful musical score that seems to be forced into scenes where the pace should be slow and steady, yet remains completely missing from the ones that are fast-paced and action-packed. It seems as if the entire budget was blown on obtaining letters of intent from famous actors, (whose normal brilliance and allure is diminished by the overall product) because obviously the budget for ""good"" music and proper editing was non-existent.

Were it not for the plethora of famous names attached to this malpractice of a movie, I would swear that a group of middle-school girls put together their X-mas gifts of: an HD camera, the latest version of Final Cut Pro for Apple and with a previously burned copy of Final Draft then decided to write, direct, film and edit a full-length feature for the sole purpose of posting it on ""youtube"" with a link to their ""facebook"" pages.

The story is a bit hard to follow since it begins in the middle and the beginning is explained in the process. The movie has an A list of actors in supporting roles. Frankly, I lost some interest in the plot resolution. I was having too much fun watching Gina Carano in action! I may go see it again.

Gina Carano's Mallory Kane has good screen presence whether fighting or not. Carano's emotional range as an actress may be limited but she isn't wooden either. One could argue that her emotional expressions are more realistic as opposed to overt theatrics. I didn't have a problem ""getting it"" in any scene. Mallory Kane's fighting skills are clever, resourceful and she delivers a kick or a punch with a purpose. Unlike many movie characters, Mallory Kane knows how to finish a fight. She was so impressive in the fight scenes the audience started to laugh in anticipation of a fight scene because we knew somebody was going to get their ass kicked. There's also a funny surprise ending that got the entire audience laughing.

Still if you can get over that (clearly at least one other reviewer here was compelled to write this is the worst movie he saw), then you will enjoy a movie that is very different.

It's Soderbergh so we should know that sometimes he goes strange places. Casting a non-actress (but ""combat"" expert) was a wise move. I haven't watched the Girlfriend Experience where he cast an Ex Adult star to play the main role, but in this case it worked out. Of course the fact that she is accompanied by quite an exquisite male cast does help a lot. The feeling that this might be older than it actually is, was intentioned of course.

Permalink",False,"Steven Soderberg has proved a rather prolific director in the last few years, and the release of Haywire fairly recently on the heels of fall's Contagion continues this pattern. It also demonstrates Soderberg's ability to move between genres with ease, segueing from world threatening virus thriller to action film. Haywire is not the most remarkable of films, working well within the standard genre framework, but manages to be entertaining none the less.

Haywire focuses on Mallory Kane (Gina Carano), an operative with a private firm that is often contracted to handle jobs that the U.S. government doesn't want to get its hands dirty with. Mallory just recently completed a job in Barcelona, freeing a hostage, and followed that up with a mission to Dublin to make contact with an Eastern European asset that her firm wants to begin a relationship with. However, things quickly go South as the operative she was partnered with for the job (Michael Fassbender) attempts to kill her and she finds herself on the run, with her former employer, Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) chasing after her with intentions of taking her out. Mallory must now try to unravel why she is a target and save her own skin at the same time.

Haywire makes a claim to fame by featuring Mixed Martial Arts champion Gina Carano in the central role as Mallory Kane. Needless to say, this isn't the first time Hollywood has turned to the world of sports to find an action lead, film has been littered with them in the past 4 decades, from Chuck Norris to Arnold Schwarzenegger to Steven Seagal, just to name a few. With Carano, Soderberg has done a good job of picking his lead, as she proves to be more than capable in the role. In addition to her physical prowess, Carano manages to hold her own alongside the rather accomplished supporting cast, which in addition to Fassbender and Gregor includes such actors as Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas and Bill Paxton. Based on her performance in Haywire, it would not be unreasonable to assume that Carano will manage to find additional acting work in the future.

Script wise, Haywire is nothing tremendously special, featuring many of the traditional troupes of an espionage action thriller, with double crosses, hidden agendas and characters with shady motivations. Haywire also manages to keep the audience guessing at times as to whether some of the characters are what they seem. The narrative is at times somewhat complex, but not so much as to not manage to resolve its central plot by the time the credits roll.

Where Haywire really shines is in the staging of its action sequences. Unlike the recent norm of featuring excessive jump cuts, shaky camera moves and extreme close-ups of various fight sequences, Soderberg takes full advantage of Carano's expertise in fighting and delivers well- framed, appropriately edited fights that keep the adrenaline going without leaving you scratching your head as to what the heck is actually going on during the brawls. It's a shame that you have to single out a film that accomplishes the basics well in comparison to so many other films that can't even seem to manage that these days.

While I doubt anyone will be putting Haywire on a pedestal for action film greatness anytime soon, Soderberg accomplishes what he seems to set out to do in delivering a reasonably exciting thriller with a new, capable face in the lead. Now we get to wait and see what Soderberg will give us next."

I cant believe the likes of Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas and Michael Douglas would have anything to do with this! It is extremely cringe worthy in places and the action scenes are truly poor. the soundtrack is like something from the seventies and and the musical attempts to add to suspense moments are atrocious. even the story line is lacking anything credible apparently i have to write 10 lines but I'm struggling to say how poor it is! Completely amateur its just complete rubbish....

Permalink",True,"With an old-school style and a pacing that never lets up the tension Haywire is a throbbing showcase for its lead star mixed Martial Arts fighter Gina Carano as operative-for-hire Mallory Kane. Right from the opening scene we know we're in a store for a special kind of action flick. This woman does all her own stunts and you're likely to be watching a second time through just to enjoy every punch of every smash cut of the movie.

Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is one of the best operatives the government has. She's positively ruthless in her efficiency, always taking care of loose ends to ensure the success of missions. When hired to save a kidnapped journalist, she is alerted when he ends up dead and she becomes a target for elimination. Managing to dispatch the assassins who approach her, and befriending agency suit Alex Coblenz (Michael Douglas) she works her way up the food chain to the one who put the finger on her.

Looking back I remember my fascination with the old Avengers British TV show form the 60s and my secret thrill at watching Diana Rigg's Emma Peel lower the kibosh on some underestimating bad guy. I think every man thought that having a beautiful leather-clad beauty kick their brains in was the ultimate thrill. There's a lot of that same currency here as director Steven Soderburgh lovingly follows Carano through action territory.

There is a missing element in the movie that would lift it to a higher level. Carano never goes up against another female fighter and this would add considerable range and depth to the flick. There are also some stumbles in Carano's acting movements. She's not an actor, and Soderburgh smartly constructs scenes so that the woman can rely on primal emotional responses. Her character is a contract killer and the movie sticks to character interactions that emphasize the cold and calculating business of killing.

What Soderburgh's film smartly does is recall the feeling of the movies from the 70s and 80s that were essentially exposes on the secret kill squads that worked Cuba, and European soil in the name of Democracy. Soderburgh even goes so far as to create a visual palette that recalls the look of the super-35 MM film stock, and the available-lighting technique that was used during the day.

Soderburgh also allows the film to float off without resolving too resolutely to close the narrative. He's an intelligent director, and respects the brain power of the viewer enough to let us watch and put the pieces together on our own. Along the way he gives us some great action set-ups with Carano doing all her own stunts.

Permalink",False,"Steven Soderbergh, Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, Channing Tatum - the hype pre release was high but the reviews lacklustre. So when I finally came to watch this movie I had little expectation. As stated previously Soderbergh has tried to put an arty spin on an action movie which doesn't quite work. The story is too loose and some of the character development far too shallow. However for me the highlight was the surprisingly good performance from Gina Carano. A great introduction to high profile acting from a believable actor who looks stunning and can really pack a punch. Hopefully we will get to see a lot more of Gina in the future.

Permalink",True,"""Haywire"" is divided by places- Upstate New York, Barcelona, Dublin, Majorca, New Mexico, each holding significance to Mallory Kane's (Gina Carano) revenge. She's a freelance covert operative, working across the globe. In one of her jobs, she heads to Barcelona to rescue a man who seems to be hostaged. Aaron (Channing Tatum) and other coverts help Mallory complete the task. In what seems to be the end of that job, Mallory gets dispatched to Dublin only to find out that the man she has helped escape is now dead. She realizes she is getting double crossed by the same people who have hired her. Motivated by revenge and equipped with martial arts athleticism, Mallory hunts down the man who has set her up and manages to kill a few along the way.

Steven Soderbergh's ""Haywire"" has the typical set-up for a double-crossing film. Most of the plot line feels ludicrous as the heroine manages to escape all kinds of security- Interpol, the local police and border lines. Considering she is being labelled a terrorist in order to arrest, she single-handedly avoids all chances at getting caught.

The joy of the movie lies right there. Designed by spectacular martial arts fighting sequences (and I'm assuming no stunt double was used), the bad ass no non-sense nature of Gina Carano is highly enigmatic. She pulls you in at first glance. I heard that her voice has been altered to sound deeper but her presence itself is powerfully intense. She glues you in from the moment you see her and you can't take your eyes off until the end credits. Movies like such succeed because of its main character. And considering this is a debut for the former martial arts champion, it's a rock-solid introduction.

""Haywire"" never wants to be an important film. It knows its genre well and more importantly, it knows its audience. Hence, with the brilliance of Soderbergh's direction, the film delivers very well. Most people might be turned off by the lack of dialogue but the way Carano moves and fights her opponent, it's already a mouthful. I especially appreciate how Soderbergh uses color as an added effect to an already suspenseful moment. In the film's climax where most of the characters come face to face at Mallory's home, Soderbergh dilutes the scene in a chilling dark blue. He eliminates most of the sound and is left with footsteps and minor thumps. That scene itself is a major triumph for the film. You know what's coming and you know where the players are situated, and when the truth about the events are revealed, Soderbergh delivers an electrifying and violent climax.

The film also has an excellent array of supporting players in Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton, Channing Tatum and Michael Angarano. These are talented individuals that helped each scene arrive more intensely. others should take pointers on how this film was perfectly edited. There were no fillers, leaving you pumped from start to finish. It's well-acted, well-directed and well-executed. ""Haywire"" is a first-rate action thriller.

**** (4 Stars)

Permalink",False,"If you like agent thrillers this one hits bull's eye! It's not so much the story - there is only so much room for novelty in this genre - but more the way the whole film is made. Music is used, or not used, very creatively, suspense comes by following the main actor closely and often in silence, and everything just works. The story is being told in a coveted way without confusing anyone.

There is a fair use of irony, and the acting throughout is good. The heroine might come over as a tad masculine, but she does a masculine job. No whiny scenes here.

Overall maybe the best agent thriller this year, I am happy I went!

Permalink",False,"'HAYWIRE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

Director Steven Soderbergh teamed with writer Lem Dobbs to make this B action film specifically to showcase star Gina Carano's talents. Carano is a female MMA fighter who impressed Soderbergh so much that he decided he needed to make this action vehicle for her to star in. He's surrounded her with a wide assortment of A-list talent including Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton and Channing Tatum. The movie is all Carano's though. She really is an action movie star and this is the perfect flick for her to show off in!

Carano plays a Black Ops soldier named Mallory Kane. Kane is the best at handling operations government officials can't be involved in. After an assignment in Dublin goes bad she finds herself double crossed and hunted by her former employers. McGregor plays her boss and ex-lover who is the primary person wanting her dead. She of course must use the talents and skills she's best with to survive and outwit her old allies.

The story is about as simple and routine as they come, which is surprising coming from Soderbergh. He's proved himself to be one of the most diverse filmmakers in the business though and it really shows here. The film is Tarantino-esque and classic grindhouse material. It's Carano that really shines though. She's smokin' hot and bad-ass and a true action movie star!

Channing Tatum is a nice-looking guy and did a great job. Michael Douglas was great in the part. But as it turned, I was totally won over by Gina Carano and am hoping for a sequel to this unique and well performed movie. While not being demure and ""pretty"" in a standard way, I found her character and her natural athleticism very appealing. The ending was left perfectly for a sequel and I will be disappointed if there isn't one.

Permalink",True,"I tried to hold myself back, but eventually, I just couldn't. Soderbergh and the entire cast should have gone into hiding after this movie, but I guess that's what happens if the director is also the DP, gaffer, and editor. Now, it's not that unusual that Soderbergh fills several shoes at once, but this time, the result is a prime example that should be shown to film schools around the world HOW NOT TO DO IT. Everything in this movie is horrible, starting from the script, the acting, down to the camera and the framing ... ugh, don't even get me started on the camera and the framing. Several times in the movie, if it weren't for the well-known actors, you would actually think that you are looking at a film made by a flunking first-year student -- yeah, it's that horrible. Seriously, the framing is even below amateurish standards, trying to create suspense by imitating ""docu-fiction"" style. Has worked tremendously well in TRAFFIC, but here, it's just so pitifully bad that it makes me wonder how much money was paid to get positive reviews - because nobody in his right mind could recommend this film. What more, how could a distributor even be persuaded to distribute this sad creation, especially when relatively few movies get cinematic release - this should have disappeared straight to DVD. This movie was an incredible waste of my money, and I wish I could demand it back, but I guess it serves as a lesson that even masters like Soderbergh can screw up phenomenally - it's a sure runner-up for the Golden Raspberry.

The action was OK, but, not enough to redeem the film. The fight scenes where old news and clich√© filled with plot jumps, bad audio, and overly unrealistic, but, not quite fantastic technique displayed by the fighters.

If I had to pick one thing though, that made this movie unbearable, it was the music. Never since ""Juno"", has the music literally made me scream out in agony and disgust. Whoever worked on the music for this movie, must be fired immediately and never work again near anything that will touch the ears of the innocent again. This is not an exaggeration, the music was loud and lacked any semblance to any genre I have ever heard.

Permalink",False,"I kept waiting for this movie to suck ... but it never really did.

Generally I check reviews and ratings before I rent movies, but this one caught my eye at the video shop. I did however check IMDb before I watched it, and figured I had made a mistake and was in for some tedious viewing.

But instead I found it very good indeed. Yes, there are plot holes. Yes, the acting isn't stellar and the basic scenario has been done many times before, but come on people, you need to take it on its own terms and in terms of the basic ""agent out in the cold"" action/thriller with the usual shady dealings/betrayals in high places, it acquits itself very well.

I'm generally pretty critical - ""Hanna"" for instance, a similar tale but with a young girl rather than a woman, was preposterous from start to finish.

There will probably never be a truly realistic action film. Most fights in the real world end quickly with one person writhing on the ground in pain, which is not very entertaining. So all action films - including the ""Gold Standard"" Bourne series - have to have supposedly highly trained killers slugging away with blow after blow that would fell an ox and somehow our hero escapes broken bones, massive swelling or even serious bruising. Even gunshot wounds only cause minor discomfort and seem always to come right overnight.

So we have to suspend disbelief, and this movie doesn't overly strain that capacity in my view. The fights were gritty and involving, the photography was excellent. The supporting characters were well-cast and believable. The lead actress gave a very credible portrayal of the sort of person she was supposed to be.

All in all, I was very satisfied and enjoyed a good evening's entertainment."

Permalink",True,"Haywire tells the story of an agent who gets crossed by her crew so then she decides to seek revenge. Having not knowing much of MMA, I was one of the people who had not known of Gina Carano prior to Haywire, so I did not expect anything too much from her. Right from the opening scene we could see that she has something and as the audience are watching throughout, it is clear that she is very talented and has screen presence. Her acting will get better as she gains more experience and roles.

On Haywire, I was a bit skeptical but decided to check out the film. Haywire is a very mysterious action thriller. Throughout, you are wondering what is going on and when might this get better. There is a lot of silence most especially when we See Mallory dodge her way through the city escaping the police force. I enjoyed the soundtrack, found it fit but there just was a little much silence and not enough dialogue. The first 45 minutes evolves Channing Tatum (Aaron) and it somewhat drags and becomes slightly boring. We then get introduced to Michael Fassbender's character whom he plays the friend to Mallory in which they rent out a hotel and visit a banquet. It isn't too long until havoc starts and we see his exit (which is unexpected and the film actually gets better). Ewan McGregor is throughout as the lead villain Kenneth and he does a great job. The final 30 minutes (around where him and his crew find Mallory's father's house) shows possibly the best scenes in the film. The action kicks in and so does the suspense. The final fight scene between Kenneth and Mallory is really well directed, shot and overall gets the job done.

* Having rewatched Haywire (11/1), I found more things that I have missed on my first viewing. A lot more back story involving the dialogue and making notes of the fights scenes. There were about 6 major fight scenes (we see Gina take her own as it is very believable- First scene in the coffee shop against Aaron, second while she is chasing the suspect and drops the blinds down on him, third against Paul in the hotel thus by killing him via gun towards pillow in the face (whole sequence leading up to it brilliant), fourth while she has escaped and surveying Dublin against two police offices that pop up, fifth more leaning towards the end against one of her ex crew at her father's house, and the final six showdown that she sneaks by Kenneth at the ocean while he unsuspectingly did not realize. This was very well shot and the glimpse of the fight were great. Again for more rewatching 11/5, Haywire does a great job.

The story plot is more complex than people take it for and thus you must listen closely to the dialogue. Haywire isn't a brainless action movie such as Salt (the trailers made it seem like another action film), though a more polished spy thriller such as the Bourne films. If you go into the film knowing that it is more slow paced and a spy film you should enjoy it for it is.

Permalink",False,"Just watched Haywire and I thought Gina Carano was amazing. Whether its writers, directors or movie moguls, most of Hollywood doesn't seem to believe that women are capable of physically overpowering and defeating men, that they are naturally weaker because of their femaleness. But there is a series of characters, actresses and films/TV shows that are offering females who have no problem taking down their male opponents.

Haywire showed the best action sequences I've seen for some time and Gina Carano is so tough I almost felt sorry for the guys she was fighting because I knew they didn't stand a chance. And she's not alone, with Emily VanCamp (Revenge), Zoe Saldana (The Losers, Columbiana) and Rooney Mara (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) showing that women are just as capable as men when it comes to kicking ass and taking names.

Permalink",False,"From the first scene to the last, loved this film. I read reviews that said Gina Carano was stiff and at times cold or emotionless- which I thought was perfect. It may have been due her lack of acting experience, but, for her role, it was ideal. An assassin (I can only imagine)isn't the Susie Sunshine type. Why would she be warm and engaging. I watched the film having no idea who she was- but thought wow- here's a new female action star I would watch again and again.

As far as the film, the story itself- a bit formulaic, but in way that was not insulting and the direction made the pieces fun to watch. The cinematography and speed of the action was dead on. While some might find the action jerky, I think that is what keeps you on edge. The fight scenes were great- no overly polished as a real fight would not be either.

Overall, I am surprised the film did not do better.

Permalink",True,"Haywire is a spy thriller centring on Mallory (Gina Carano) who works for a shadowy organisation which works for another shadowy organisation and who, as the film starts, is trying to come back from a betrayal which has put her on the run. I won't summarise the plot, which is less complicated than it appears, but is made more complicated by the decision to start the film in the middle, so that the first part is told in flashback to a kidnapped motorist (Michael Angarano, who has the misfortune to play a character who is needed only for his car and his abilities to bandage a wound and listen).

This movie is interesting - it is, of its kind, quite good. The plot works fairly well, there is always a well-staged action sequence just around the corner, and there is an excellent cast - Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum, Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Bill Paxton, Antonio Banderas) - and the main character is played by Gina Carano.

My first thought was ""Gina who?"" My second was that she must be the go-to girl when they can't get Angelina Jolie. But both thoughts turn out to be unkind because, coming out of nowhere (particularly to the British viewer: apparently she was on the US Gladiators TV show), she successfully holds this movie together. She has an attractive and agreeable screen presence, and strong physical charisma and is, by no means, overshadowed by the higher profile names who are supporting her.

I didn't expect this to be good - it was very much better than I thought it would be.

Permalink",False,"Sure, the plot isn't very original. Going into this movie, you know what it's basically about, and there aren't any mind-blowing twists. Also, some viewers may find the pacing a little weird. In a matter of seconds it can go from pretty high octane action to an extremely slow, drawn out scene. But I didn't mind any of this. Not at all. For me, it seemed to add realism.

The action is exceptionally well done. If you're like me, you all too often find yourself groaning during action movies, because the choreography tends to be either (a) so over the top that you're constantly reminded that you're watching a movie or (b) so committed to realism that it's not much fun to watch. To achieve the sweet spot in the middle, you evidently need people who are real martial artists, as Gina Carano is, and you need to just let them do what they do, without trying to turn it into something it's not. I just don't see this often enough, which is one big reason why this movie really stands out for me. I did see four or five moves which struck me as plain silly, but these were easily outweighed by all the slick, realistic action.

Another reason this movie stands out is that it didn't compromise on quality as far as the acting was concerned. I was totally prepared to forgive Carano for a mediocre performance, but it turns out that there's very little, if anything, to forgive. Her character is pretty wooden, but she is, after all, a hardened agent. It was refreshing to see a lead actor not going out of her way to make audiences like her. That said, she wasn't a bland character either; it's just that her humanity and femininity were restrained and subtle--which, again, seemed perfectly fitting. (Carano's looks are another matter altogether. I think Soderbergh, to his credit, went to some effort to take the spotlight off of Carano's darling face and smokin' body. I appreciate the result, but I'm glad he didn't try harder.)

In general, the director and cast did a fine job. The characters behaved naturally, the dialogue never seemed forced, and, even when there was no action, there was enough interesting stuff being said and done to keep me focused and entertained. It seems the cast all respected the material enough to refrain from unnecessarily dressing things up. You might expect as much from such a star-studded cast, but don't forget that it often doesn't work out that way.

There's a reason why Bond and Bourne movies will probably continue to outsell movies like Haywire. They're bigger, more over the top, and louder in every way. But those kinds of movies are getting to be a dime a dozen. Haywire is special because it's modest and understated in ways that work, it's very nicely executed, and it still packs an exceptional punch. Next time you find yourself in the mood for a lean, competent action movie, give this one a try."

It's a risky place to make a movie. You might end up pleasing nobody, but this movie is so well crafted that I could not help liking it and enjoying the ride. I had never heard of Gina Carino, but after the first fight sequence I immediately sat up and took notice. This girl can REALLY fight and it shows. She is balletic in her movement, and the blows look very real and very dangerous. The real fighting skill she possesses makes her a joy to watch. The story is spartan and has a verit√© and bleakness that might be depressing if the action and setting was not so luscious. It is basically a magnificent and atmospheric joy ride for grownups. I loved it.

Permalink",False,"To say that this movie sucked would be an insult to movies that suck.

After watching the trailer and seeing some of the big named stars in this movie(Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, and Ewan McGregor) I became excited with the idea of a great action film with the possibility of many sequels. The movie trailer was action packed; Gina Carano appeared to be the perfect combination of beautiful and bad ass; and a Google search only enforced this perception. I saw this movie as a good entertainment investment. After all, Rotten Tomatos gave this film an 82%. Critics stated ""Haywire is a fast and spare thriller, with cleanly staged set pieces that immerse you in the action.""

In just the first five minutes of the film it was easy to see that Ms Carano could not act. This left me thinking that this shouldn't be a problem since, after all, transition from fighter to action star doesn't look like it's all that easy. Chuck Norris'early attempts at acting were really, really bad, but the films themselves were enjoyable. Plus, Chuck got better over time.

Within 45 minutes of the movie's start, half the audience in the theater I was in left. Why? Well, the action was slow; the acting horrible and the plot missing until the last 10 minutes of the movie. By the time you find out what's going on, you don't care.

All things being equal, though, I think Ms Carano deserves another chance. She's new to acting, so she deserves at least one pass. On the other hand, I don't know if I want to see another Steven Soderbergh film for a while though. This isn't his first rodeo, so he should know better.

Save your money and go and see something else. I promise you'll be happier for it."

Permalink",True,"""Haywire"" is a stylish, action-packed thriller which delivers in spades. Everything movies like ""Salt"", ""Colombiana"", ""Domino"" (a Keira Knightley flick from a few years back) and others, tried to be, ""Haywire"" is.

Gina Carano is excellent in the movie. She is so believable, whereas I never bought Angelina Jolie's and Zoe Saldana's physicality in their respective roles, Gina Carano succeeds to a high degree. The fight scenes in the movie are brutal, heavy-handed, and not for a minute did I doubt that she could really fight and be as strong as she appears.

The cast is unexpectedly populated with quite a lot of big names, like Michael Fassbender, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor and others. For a movie that had a limited budget and was shot quite quickly, the cast list is impressive indeed.

Sodebergh's direction is as masterful as ever, with that weird, slick, elegant and slightly voyeuristic angle. The movie does not spoon feed its audience and you have to actually pay attention to the plot and story in this movie. This is not necessarily a linear, straight forward action flick. It is reminiscent of Sodebergh's ""The Limey"" and even ""Out Of Sight"". After the underrated ""The Girlfriend Experience"" and ""Contagion"", Sodebergh continues his venture into experimenting with different genres of movies.

Gina Carano is the heart and soul of the movie, and one look at her it is easy to see why! I sincerely hope that she can get other high-profile roles, because in this movie fan's humble opinion, she definitely has star potential!

""Haywire"" works on all cylinders! One of the best action thrillers since perhaps ""Ronin"" and more recently, ""Taken"". This is definitely recommended viewing!

Permalink",True,"Intelligence operative Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is set up as a patsy by her employers who want to bury her and a black op with bad PR potential in a hole so deep no one will be able to discover the truth. Ms.Kane is a rather difficult genie to back in her bottle however and soon after being targeted for elimination turns the tables on her betrayers.

Sex appeal has little regard for practicality. A woman who can kill you 100 different ways shouldn't be sexy for any guy whose life means anything to him but the character Mallory Kane as portrayed by Gina ""Conviction"" Carano has an utterly overpowering sensuality. It is more than confidence and quite probably taps into something darker in the subconscious.

That aspect is intrinsic to the performance - one of an icy killer with a pathological lack of trust that in her line of work (Black ops specialist so expensive governments can only afford to hire her on contract) is just good thinking. The element of danger and threat shouldn't be appealing but it is. For the first time I have a sense of the appeal a character like James Bond offers women.

Critics haven't all been kind with Gina Carano's performance. I found it intriguing though not without its flaws. She has all the natural assets a good actress needs for convincing characterization and will improve. She will emote on camera more comfortably with the confidence that comes with rehearsal and experience.

In this particular production I found her quite convincing and accepted her as this dangerous woman who seemingly never loses control of her emotions and is continually storing her breath and her energy for the next life or death encounter. Those aspects make for an intriguing character study.

Mallory Kane is a freak. Not a freak of nature but rather a freak of nurture. A second generation Marine schooled in martial arts, black ops and warped mentally by life on the edge perpetrating acts both immoral and illegal can make a person different from others. They can seem less than human in some ways and superhuman in others. Ms.Carano offers a good balance in showing this persona.

Her action sequences are also spectacular, staged inventively and performed with precision. Every movement is riveting.

A lot of people can't let themselves enjoy the performance knowing that the star was an MMA champ. They'd prefer not to encourage cage fighters to act and I would agree with the exception being Gina Carano, a performer with star quality and the solid fundamentals of range as an actress.

Permalink",False,"This film is a fresh and unique attempt (with some very welcome sense of the seventies old cinema) from a daring director to reform the genre of action movies.

If you just love cinema in its purest and simplest form like i do, and you want to see the most realistic fight scene EVER shown on the big screen (this at the hotel), do not miss Haywire.

What a revelation! What a wonderful war goddess is she! Sooo sweet and elegant and sooo deadly at the same time! Now we have our Wonder Woman, also the real Lara Croft, maybe...even the new James Bond!!!

Permalink",True,"Steven Soderbergh's ""Haywire"" takes an interesting and seldom used approach to the spy action thriller: It strips away all visual and thematic pretensions and simply plunges headfirst into pure adrenaline-pumping espionage. I'm hard pressed to say that the story is simple, and yet it's clear to me that everything unnecessary has been left out, leaving only that which must be there for the sake of advancement. Although the fight sequences are highly choreographed and not at all within the realm of possibility, they're mercifully spared the phoniness and posturing of macho stunt spectaculars and martial arts epics; every punch, kick, jab, slap, uppercut, and body slam is an exercise in simple, direct brutality. Here is a film in which all the fat has been trimmed. It's a lean, mean fighting machine.

I can't help but wonder how something so difficult to follow can still manage to be so engrossing. The film weaves a convoluted web of intrigue that spans nations, professions, personal relationships, and ranks. Keeping track of the details is next to impossible, and yet the story is told with such relentless speed and razor-sharp precision that watching it is nothing short of hypnotic. I was especially taken with its visual style, which is sparse yet surprisingly bold. And while I'm usually not the first to recognize violence as entertainment, I found myself absorbed in the fight sequences, probably because they aren't as glorified as they would be in most Hollywood action films. In spite of their brevity, they're incredibly kinetic, and they're not dramatized with a pounding rock underscore. We only have the sounds of pounding flesh and breaking furniture.

It tells the story of Mallory Kane (Gina Carano), a trained marine and a contractor for a private firm, which the American government relies on for covert operations. We can tell from the opening shot that she's on the run. At the start of the film, she arrives at a small diner in upstate New York, where she's approached by a fellow contractor named Aaron (Channing Tatum). He asks her to go with him. She refuses. The scene immediately shifts from tense to exciting when the two start fighting in clear view of the public. Mallory wards Aaron off by breaking his arm, intervenes with a random customer named Scott (Michael Angarano), and apprehends his car. Despite his obvious shock, Mallory takes him with her and tells him her story thus far. For as yet unknown reasons, she has him memorize names and locations.

For the next forty minutes or so, the film intercuts between the car ride and two of Mallory's covert missions. One is in Barcelona, where she and Aaron were hired to rescue a kidnapped a journalist named Jiang (Anthony Brandon Wong) and deliver him to their contact, Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas). The other is in Dublin, where she and a British agent named Paul (Michael Fassbender) will pose as husband and wife and infiltrate the Rossborough House. I will not reveal the specifics of the latter mission. I will say that it leads to an unsettling turn of events: Mallory has been set up by her own firm, which, as fate would have it, is led by her ex- boyfriend, Kenneth (Ewan McGregor). In the eyes of the American government, she's now a fugitive. She spends the rest of the film solving the mystery behind the betrayal.

Along the way, we will also meet a government agent named Coblenz (Michael Douglas), who always seems to know more than he lets on, and Mallory's father, John (Bill Paxton), a writer who lives in New Mexico and is well aware of her daughter's profession. Rest assured, there will be plenty of hand-to-hand combat as the story progresses. There will even at one point by a chase on the streets, through the back alleys, and across the rooftops of Dublin, where Mallory moves with the stealth of an assassin as she's being pursued by military men with guns. Although she lacks the mystique and solitary disposition of a samurai warrior, she is clearly an expert at what she does and is intensely focused even when under stress. She can't possibly be emotionally walled off, for she cares for her father and was once in love with Kenneth. Having said that, she she is remarkably in control of her feelings and maintains an attitude of steely professionalism.

Much has been made of the casting of Gina Carano, mostly in regards to her experience as a mixed martial arts fighter and her appearance on the TV series ""American Gladiators."" I agree that her physical strength gives the violent scenes in ""Haywire"" a certain authenticity. But let's not short change her; she adds something to the film even when she isn't fighting. In fact, let's not short change anyone; all the actors in the film are well cast. I can't pretend that I fully understood the plot, nor can I say that I was able to keep track of the details or even make sense of the reason Carano's character was framed. But what the film lacked in clarity was more than made up for in spectacle, strength of character, excitement, and a very brisk pace (with a running time of just ninety-three minutes to boot).

Permalink",False,"22 January 2012. If not for a relatively smart plot outline, though the actual script had problems, and also for a rather intelligent and more pedestrian approach to espionage, this movie could have been a cheap, American version of one of those by the numbers Asian martial art action movies. It's really difficult to determine whether the more casual and perhaps more realistic setting and behind the scenes look at spying made the movie for artistic, an art film, or a more less sharp, slow paced movie that seemed to be boring rather than compelling. The extended back and forth flashbacks seemed quite unnecessary and there were a number of strategic flaws in the movies such as when there was an obvious opportunity to break an arm or when there was missing shooting out only one instead of two vehicles' wheels. The actual fighting scenes were either more real or more dull depending on what the authentic fighting is really like. It is interesting that for a female contract agent, she sustains much more real spills and falls and injuries than in most espionage movies with men. Overall the movie was uneven, too slow in places, and sometimes much more difficult to follow than was necessary.

This movie tried to be more sophisticating raising a refreshing new look, but it wasn't pulled off, especially with the use of the faded tone color for flashbacks and even the apparent avoidance of direct shots using only implied shots that lose the action (such as when an explosive device goes off later in the movie, the audience only hears it) even as the primary character herself set it up. Thus instead of movie such as The Informant! (2009) which has class as well as a unique personality with an interesting sense of humor, Wild Target (2010) that had a more classy look, it needed to incorporate more intelligent ambiance as The Good Shepard (2006) in order to meld the more artful look with the carefully choreographed fighting scenes that seemed as far as from the stylized, appealing scenes found in Elektra (2005).

Instead the movie suffered from not being even more raw, gritty in its depiction as with Shadowboxer (2005) or Breach (2007) or the riveting pacing and action found in Deja Vu (2006) or the Bourne Identity (2002). Perhaps the overlooked but superlative espionage movie with Val Kilmer, Spartan (2004) had the right setting and tone and directing that was best suited for the intention of Haywire."

Permalink",False,"Screenwriter Lem Dobbs and filmmaker Steven Soderbergh fashioned this ultimately routine globe-trotting action thriller as a vehicle for famed Mixed Martial Arts fighter Gina Carano. Gina shows poise in the role of Mallory Kane, an operative for a private firm hired to retrieve a kidnapped journalist. Things go wrong, and eventually she is double crossed; an attempt is made on her life. Naturally, she will go on the lam and be on a mission of vengeance; she desperately relates her story (what she knows of it, anyway) to an innocent young man (Michael Angarano) as she appropriates his car and his services.

The film certainly looks great, but as a showcase for Ginas' fighting skills, it's not all it could be. She does righteously kick some ass, and look great doing it, but the relatively brief ""Haywire"" (running an hour and 33 minutes) does get rather bogged down in story. Ginas' screen presence is fine, although she was apparently dubbed by actress Laura San Giacomo, with whom Soderbergh worked on ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"". Still, it's easy enough to root for her, and Soderbergh keeps the pedal to the metal throughout. The story is nothing special, but for anybody who might get confused, it all gets explained right near the end.

Soderbergh made sure to surround Gina with excellent co-stars who could help to do some of the heavy lifting: Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Bill Paxton, Michael Fassbender, Mathieu Kassovitz. McGregor is enjoyably slimy as her boss, and Paxton is wonderfully low key as her loving dad.

""Haywire"" is technically a slick picture, and the propulsive music score by David Holmes helps to drive the tale forward. It wastes no time getting into the story, as the title & credits are saved for the final several minutes of the run time. At the very least, it proved that Carano had the potential to be an icon in this genre.

Permalink",False,"Soderbergh has an act for choosing the leads for some of his special project films i.e. The Girlfriend Experience and Haywire. To choose a ""non-actor"" in the the sense of the word as the lead is a bold, and gutsy choice, and it has paid off for The Girlfriend Experience and Haywire as it gives a certain authenticity to the project.

The fights in Haywire are slick and right up Gina Carano's alley as they tie into her forte (or ex forte of fighting style). Carano is actually very good in the lead and gives a very honest performance.

Well worth the watch for the story and slick fighting sequences.

Permalink",False,"With Steven Soderburgh at the helm and a multi A-list line up (Ewen MacGregor, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton & Channing Tatum), this should have been far far better than it turned out to be. That being said, it's largely unknown main player Gina Corano does a fantastic job in the lead role. The extras on the DVD would suggest that this whole project was built around her, which is amazing in itself, using an amazing amount of recognised talent around somebody who was only really previously known as an MMA fighter. She was obviously unphased by all this and easily comes out as the star of the show. The plot is a little confusing at first, but given that it was a mere 88 minutes long, it soon pieces itself together. Most of the main stars roles, apart from MacGregor, are not very big at all but it's not the acting that is the fault here....it's the character building. Basically, there isn't any at all (probably due to the films length), which suggests to me that Soderburgh could have made a longer, more intriguing movie. The films premise is quite intriguing itself, but it's lack of feeling leaves the viewer a little flat. Soderburgh does not however focus on Corano's fighting talents alone.....to me he has helped to create a very good actress and this reflects in some of the films that she has appeared in since.

To sum up....I found this quite a good spy thriller, but in the main I was left a little disappointed when there was so much talent on show."

Permalink",True,"Told mostly in flashback this film shows how mercenary Mallory Kane is betrayed by her employers. She is initially sent to Barcelona to extract a hostage then, almost immediately afterwards she is sent on a mission to Dublin. Here she has a bit of a shock when she finds the man she had just rescued dead in a storeroom and her contact tries to kill her. She manages to overcome him and evade the Garda to get back to the United States; here she sets about finding out who set her up and why.

This may not be a classic but it is a solid action thriller that fans of the genre are likely to enjoy. The cast list features plenty of well-known actors but they are in the secondary roles; the star is the virtually unknown Gina Carano; a martial arts expert who shows off her impressive fighting skills in the films action scenes. These scenes are surprisingly visceral and look genuinely painful at times. The story of fairly standard; we just have to wonder who betrayed her and how she will deal with them when she catches up with them. The fight scenes may provide the best action but there are good chases and the occasional shoot out too. Overall I'd say this is a fun way to pass an hour and a half if you like films with some good solid action.

The plot is fairly slim and isn't particularly well explained, but I wasn't watching the movie for the plot. I wanted action, a little intrigue, good visuals and atmosphere and it was provided in spades.

The whole film has a bit of a B-movie feel with an unusual slightly retro soundtrack. The action isn't spectacular or flashy (this is no Bourne movie) but that allows the movie to get the best from it's star Gina. I wasn't familiar with her MMA background but I felt it was used well and added an exciting alternative to Bourne style action. The locations are varied and interesting and a bonus several scenes take place in Dublin which added to my personal enjoyment as It's a city I frequent, but if you haven't been there you'll at least enjoy the unfamiliar setting. The director's use of location shots and more realistic(ish) action may make the movie a little slow for those expecting break neck action start to finish.

Personally I felt the acting was good enough for the type of movie and Gina isn't any worse than the major male action stars."

Permalink",False,"Haywire is a revenge film, but not your typical one. It starts off a bit slow while it establishes the reasoning for why Gina Carano's character, Mallory, wants to get revenge. But once Mallory begins her payback, the film became a lot more interesting. The two highlight scenes for me would be the Carano/Fassbender fight scene in the hotel room and the lights off in the house scene. This movie feels very much like a Soderbergh film, with the hazy feeling around the edges of the film that is also used in Contagion, Side Effects, and Behind The Candelabra. I was a tad bit disappointing by the ending. I felt it was abrupt and not in a good way, but it didn't ruin the movie for me. This may disappoint people who were expecting a straight up action film, but for those who don't mind the stylistic choices, this will be an worthwhile watch.

Permalink",False,"I don't know what drove me to see Haywire... maybe it was the reactions from many people, and it seemed to not please mainstream audiences. It wasn't because I am a huge fan of Soderbergh, since the only other film I have seen from him is Contagion (excellent film, by the way). But I'm glad I did. This reminds me a little of Kill Bill in it's approach and how it comes off at first, with a style oozing out of the screen. It's definitely a film done with such care, and it's Soderbergh attempting many things. It has a retro score and tone, but the editing and cinematography are as crisp as imaginable. The story is pretty simple, and overall, it could have done some more with its script, but damn, it's style is incredibly enjoyable. It reminds me of Drive and Hanna as being another sort of ""art-action film"", although what that means for many is up to debate. I expect this to stand as one of the most sensory- stimulating films of the year, because it's technical achievements are fantastic. Oh, and Gina Carano is a great lead for this, she has the attitude, the body, and the perfect performance.

Unlike the Bourne trilogy, you could hit Matt Damon with a steel pipe and he wouldn't show any mark. The movie has a strong cast with good soundtrack, good story line that probably threw off the weak minded. I'm not sure where the lead actress came from, but I would love to see more of her, especially in a reprise of this role.

The action here is not over the top like in Mission Impossible, but more like The Bourne Movies, the Gina Carano character half the time almost felt like a female Jason Bourne.

The story has been too many times, so I won't some it up. But I'd be lying saying I was not entertained, which I was. There are some intense fight scenes. And all the actors from Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton, and Antoneo Banderas all shine in there own way. And Gina Carano is beautiful and sexy, but at the same time we take her seriously.

Permalink",False,"""Gina Carano"" is the next thing. She proved to be an""A"" actress, At least for her first feature film she did an amazing job, and the stunts were also performed by her, absolute perfection.

For all the folks who didn't like the movie or that dedicated actress, I bet you are the type Angelina Julie get sucked in. Oh ya, to you she is more convincing.

""Gina Carano"" delivers the kind of feeling you got when you were first introduced to ""Bruce Lee"", ""Van Damme"", or whom ever had you engaged in an action flick.

New type of a revolutionary cinematography that is growing under our skin, making the motion picture more convincing and almost real.

Watch ""Miss Bala (2011)"", which keeps you in the same state of mind due to the way the camera was handled."

Permalink",False,"Probably the best movie I've ever seen. Awesome explosion scene. I totally didn't expect what happened in the movie. I won't give it away but the star of the film is a total hottie. There were some slow spots at the beginning but once the film got going everyone in the theater was into it. After the climax the film does tend to drag on and on but the climax itself is so mind blowing that nobody in the entire room seemed to mind. It was almost like relaxing after a good game. Kind of unwinding to catch your breath after you mind had been blown. I'd recommend seeing this with someone with a good bottle of cider. Maybe after having a couple of drinks at a nice Mexican restaurant where you give your butt a couple of taps to make sure you remembered your wallet. To summarize: Wow.

Permalink",True,"If your idea of a thriller is all wham-bam-thank-you-mam, cut, cut, cut with music blaring all over the action then this is most definitely not the film for you! If, on the other hand you appreciate superbly filmed sequences shown with few cuts and largely sans music, and a plot which is allowed to develop across the whole of the film, rather than being explained within the first 5 minutes, then again 10 minutes later, then again 20 minutes in etc etc then maybe this is more your cup of char! Gina Carano - apparently a kick-boxing champion who has never acted before - plays the beautiful Mallory - a freelance former marine employed by an agency who carry out missions that Goverments want doing but don't want to be seen to want doing - who,following a seemingly successful mission in Barcelona, finds her world tumbling apart around her ears and believes her employer Kenneth (the ever excellent Ewan McGregor) has doubled crossed her in someway.

All this takes place against backdrops as diverse as the aforementioned Barcelona, Dublin, and New York - all used to great effect, mainly by using not the all-too familiar tourist areas but rather back streets and sides roads etc. The action can be seen as being on the stately side, but this allows for the plot to unravel in an intelligent way - this is a thriller that engages your brain as well as your gut! - and there are more twists and turns than a Beatles song about long and winding roads! Once again Soderbergh has delivered a film that takes a clich√©d and formulaic situation and subverted it into something more than a mere thriller. For those with ears to listen and eyes to see there is a lot here to engage with, and will leave you, like me, feeling satisfied and happy with a film that dares to be different, but, as I said at the start, if you simply want a film for which you leave your brain at box office try elsewhere!

Permalink",False,"Physically imposing Channing Tatum as Aaron politely asks Gina Carano as rogue agent Mallory to give herself up. She replies, ""I don't think so¬Ö"" Tatum throws hot coffee in Carano's face, and then viciously slams her head into the counter. She weathers the beating, and then picks her moment to unleash quick hooks. She manipulates Tatum to the ground and snaps his arm in a jujitsu lock. Carano is a fierce presence and a genuine force on screen. She is gorgeous‚Äîlong black hair and ultra fit body. The former MMA champion is imposing herself standing at 5'8"". But she is fighting ripped 6'1"" Tatum and Michael Fassbender. Carano is the real deal. Director Steven Soderbergh does justice to her fighting acumen. In ""Haywire"" you see full body fight choreography with speed, power, and precision‚Äîno quick cut edits with torso shots. Carano delivers a vicious front kick to Fassbender that sends him crashing through a door that you can almost feel.

So Soderbergh, known for ""Ocean's Eleven"" movies and ""Traffic"", is making an action movie? Curious, indeed. ""Haywire"" is at its best in accelerated mayhem and destruction. Lem Dobbs story seems almost an afterthought or excuse for Carano to just kick some ass‚Äîmostly a means to an end. Carano is a powerful physical presence. In Dobbs's story Carano plays Mallory Kane, who is black ops operative for clandestine group that contracts to the Company, headed by slick sociopathic Ewan McGregor as Kenneth. Kenneth is Mallory's former lover as well. Kenneth provides his manpower to Government Intelligence Head Coblenz played with menacing charm by Michael Douglas, who at times devours the scenery. Mallory along with Aaron run the hostage retrieval operation in Barcelona for the enigmatic Rodrigo played with passionate zeal by Antonio Banderas.

Kenneth subsequently sends Mallory on a mission to Dublin as ""eye candy"" with Paul, deadly and cool Michael Fassbender. Mallory discovers her betrayal--her cover is blown and forced to go rogue. When does an operative ever not go rogue in a movie? Dobbs's story is formulaic, but then again it was never intended to be more. Of course Mallory is determined to exact her revenge with extreme prejudice. Soderbergh infuses sufficient style and motors through the narrative‚Äîwhat little exits. ""Haywire"" is at its best when Mallory is beating the crap out of bad and good dudes. When it slows, it is not so compelling. Bill Paxton plays retired Marine Lt. Col. Kane, Mallory's Dad. According to the story Mallory was also a Marine‚Äîin Special Forces? Here Dobbs's narrative is dicey. He never hints at the source of Mallory's elite killer skills. Are we to assume she is a prettier and leaner version of the Steven Seagal persona? However, here Soderbergh provides the dramatic arc for Mallory when she calmly warns Kenneth in her father's presence, ""You can tell me right now why you sold me out."" Or she will kill him.

Carano is charismatic. However, is she really a compelling actor? Hard to discern‚Äîin ""Haywire"" she plays sullen and singular in focus. Soderbergh wisely orchestrates and leverages Carano's strengths. I think it would be interesting to see her in a more multi-dimensional role‚Äîshe kind of hints at vulnerability here. She is solid in her part. She has an uncanny chemistry with Channing Tatum, who also has distinct physical presence. His laid back charm compliments Carano's intensity. Carano's physicality also has a downside, particularly in this vengeance tale. She may be too overpowering for the logical narrative showdown. Still watching Carano springing off the wall and crashing with devastating hooks and kicks is awesome. Too bad Soderbergh doesn't give Carano much more to do than that. At least they both leave us wanting to see more."

The fight scenes were awesome, if u r a action movie fanatic like me u av to see it just for that. However the storys the same old betrayal trying to get revenge thats been used in every other film. Just see this film if u luv action. Also the cast was awesome for an ordinary action film. I've always been a big fan of Micheal fassbender and I believe he should be james bond. Just don't believe the trailer its nowhere near as good as the bourne series. However if you luv action, guns and chicks beating everyone up go see it!

Permalink",False,"The best thing about Gina Carano is not her beauty, or that she knows all the MMA moves. It's her voice, which is mesmerizing and which the director chose to use to good effect. Her role didn't allow us to assess her acting talent, or lack thereof, but she was certainly well cast. She alone makes this a film worthwhile seeing. Michael Douglas sounded like he was ad-libbing his lines,perhaps because he realized his role was almost a cameo appearance. This is to be contrasted with Antonio Banderas, who played his part to the hilt, even though it was also in a supporting role. That's what was also surprising about this movie -- amidst all the other stars, Gina Carano holds her own.

Permalink",True,"I can't believe the average (but improving) ratings from IMDb users and certainly don't agree with the many poor reviews, by same, this movie has had so far. I seldom rely on critics for my choice of movie to watch, at least not as the main factor; however, in this case, I wholeheartedly agree with Rotten Tomatoes critics who, at the time of my review, had rated it 80%. Thankfully, one of the prolific authors at IMDb, David Ferguson, was brave enough to call it as he saw it.

The plot is simple, tried and true: A former special ops, turned private contractor agent for an employer who deals with intelligence, and the likes, agencies, is betrayed and becomes a target; she sets out to find out why and who is responsible and then exacts fitting justice. I don't understand why so many viewers/users who wrote reviews found that plot hard to follow; perhaps the concept of what a thriller is has eluded them. The movie follows Mallory Kane, played by Gina Carano, as she fights her way out of deadly traps and up the ladder to the person responsible for her being a target; the motive is nothing simpler than the greed of one person. Early on, we can pretty much guess that the person responsible is one of two intelligence bosses, Michael Douglas or Antonio Banderas; we do have to wait, as a thriller is suppose to deliver, to find out. Anyone familiar with Steven Soderbergh knows he can direct thrillers. I suppose the harsh criticism of the plot and dialogue came from those who just wanted to beat their chest, sort of speak; that doesn't make them right.

The script by Lem Dobbs, another accomplished writer, was a perfect fit for Soderbergh; he avoids superfluous dialogue and sticks with what is needed for the genre action thriller to work. Keeping in mind that special ops field persons are quick thinkers, they adapt and act accordingly, we should not expect diatribes when the context and flow does not warrant it. An example of the smart and parsimonious dialogue, as pointed out by David Ferguson: The very first word and very last word spoken, one worded sentence, was the four letter S-word. It takes a minute or so for the viewer to grasp how fitting that choice was in the beginning (fight scene no less striking than in Bourne drives that point across) but less than a second for it to sink in at the end; as soon as the word S**** is spoken, the screen turns dark and the credits start scrolling down. You will certainly smile or grin and say to yourself¬ÖOh yeah. That should give you an idea of the pace of the movie as well as how smart I thought it was.

There are big names in this movie but their parts are ones supporting the lead, somewhat like in the first three 'Bourne'. I can only assume the followers of such big names and currently hot actors was to ensure the movie would get good numbers right from the start as that was my reason to pick it. Carano has the looks and certainly the physique for a great female Bourne type character. She did not leave me wanting in the action scenes. Soderbergh was wise to keep the dialogue of the lead to a minimum and the fight choreography at a high level if he was trying to get that effect of female Bourne type character. In my opinion he has succeeded, despite what some users say. Those, like critics, who watch more movies than the average movie viewer, concluded that the movie hit the mark. I recommend the movie to anyone who liked the Bourne franchise, but don't expect it to equal the Doug Liman or Paul Greengrass action thrillers (first three Bournes) , be realistic. I was looking for an action thriller here and was not disappointed.

OK, yes i can see how this film might rub a lot of people the wrong way, but it's really no worse than any other average B movie in terms of production value / shot footage. The plot actually wasn't half bad if you followed it, and I think Gina has great potential as an actress. She's got great presence on screen, and i don't know what it is about her in a fight scene, but there is just something so REAL about it. I was desperately thinking while watching some of the scenes like - OK Mr. Actor (Ewan for instance) please PLEASE remember YOUR choreography, because if YOU make a mistake and she makes contact, you won't be getting a second chance at life lmao."" The way she kicks ass is so damn hot. She is one powerful, beautiful woman for sure - damn. I don't know, I kind of liked it personally. I really hope she doesn't get discouraged by any bad press/opinions. You get this lady into a high production blockbuster and I bet you sparks would fly big time... 3 stars.

Permalink",False,"Elaborate fight scenes, a retired MMA fighter and a hell of a lot of shootings can only describe one film, Haywire (Dir. Steven Soderbergh, 2012). With actors like Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor and Michael Fassbender a movie like this receives a lot of hype. However, Steven Soderbergh always tries to use new talent, as much as old, and Haywire sees Gina Carano in her first major acting role since retiring from MMA.

One aspect of the film that will stand out to everyone who goes to see it are the fight sequences. They are thrilling, painful and exciting to watch as the characters find themselves thrown through a window or simply punched in the face. The fact that it is almost always men fighting a woman, Mallory (Gina Carano), probably makes the fight scenes a little uncomfortable to watch, even if she is frequently the victor. A fight sequence to watch out for occurs halfway through the film between Mallory and Paul (Michael Fassbender), as it is expertly choreographed and breathtaking to watch.

The cinematography of Haywire, courtesy of Soderbergh, heavily competes with that of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Dir. David Fincher, 2011). Its scenes are fantastically shot, notably one containing McGregor, Tatum and Paxton in Mallory's father's home. Without trying to give away any plot I will simply say look out for that scene. Also the editing during fight scenes is expertly pieced together with swooping tracking pans and quick cutting.

Soderbergh often makes his films global, setting them in multiple locations throughout the world. In Haywire, its universality creates an even greater sense of conspiracy, as agents from Mexico, USA and Britain attempt to stop Mallory. As well as using subtitles to state the location of the scene; colour filters, lighting effects and extreme long shots are used to make each location clear to the audience.

Michael Fassbender, Channing Tatum and Bill Paxton are the actors to watch out for in this film, as they all present interesting and believable characters. Ewan McGregor, although not on par with these three due to his American accent slipping English/Scottish from time to time, was still an asset to Haywire's narrative. Gina Carano in her first lead role was an unusual choice for Soderbergh, but evidently the right one. Her build and knowledge of fighting made her believable as the rogue agent. All I can say is, next Lara Croft?

One thing that lets Haywire down is its narrative. It feels a lot like a Bourne movie when watching it, but with a less complex story. The film also makes the flaw of starting half-way through and then relying on flashbacks to explain what happened prior to the beginning. Now I have no problem with a films narrative being told in non-chronological order, being a huge fan of Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994), but instead of using a simple flashback Mallory explains her endeavours to a young man whose car she has hijacked. The story was so weak that it does make the film seem like a lot of fights edited together with the occasional unneeded car discussion.

But to say the plot itself is weak isn't saying that the film is weak. Haywire has expert editing, fantastic cinematography, amazing actors, and awe-inspiring fight scenes. Unfortunately without a strong narrative the film can become difficult to watch in places, even if other aspects of the film are of a high standard.

The whole film is difficult to see as everything is filmed in dark light. 5. Annoying voice 6. Unnecessary music which does not fit the mood and scene. This film was different to other action films e.g James bond,Salt, Colombiana etc... It didn't feel like a film at all. It was as if the whole film is an introduction to a rubbish film. I did not understand the film from start to Finnish. Whilst you are watching it you tend to find it difficult to focus your eyes on the screen.Due to this factor it is hard to make sense of what is going on, therefore you loose interest.

When there was no music, the monotonous dialogue became too much. I found myself chuckling at inappropriate places in the movie. I asked myself several times if I should leave and thought this could not possibly be only an hour and a half. I would not recommend seeing Haywire. Please, for your own sake, don't waste your money.

Permalink",False,"The majority of people who have been reviewing this film didn't get it at all. First, it is an action movie, despite you see it as one or not. However, it's not the typical, common kind of action film people are used to. There are great action scenes and face-to-face fight sequences, but they are not shot, edited and presented in that Michael-Bay-kind-of-action which becomes unintelligible. There are no exasperating music scores to thrill the audience. The action scenes put you into the fight by letting you understand how those people are moving, what they're thinking and how all these works. They are not fighting with the camera, goddamn, so leave it there and actually show the characters struggling and moving. That's how it's done here, but it seems that the audiences are used to the confusing, explosive and epileptic action scenes. Second, of course there are mistakes and dumb choices in this movie, but it's script must be seen as a typical 80's CIA-betrayed-agent-revenge we have seen lots of times. And that's not a problem. We have years of Bruce Willis, Vin Diesel or The Rock playing the same characters in the same movies and we don't care. But when a woman starts kicking those big boys asses around, we just don't buy it. Stallone calls his gang and brings back the old 80's toughness and it's ""fun"". Come on! And don't get mistaken, Gina Carano kicks some really serious ass in this movie. To finish, it's all because of Steven Soderbergh. In Haywire he joins the cinematography of Traffic, the cool, stylish soundtrack of Ocean's 11 in an unique an very personal view of the action genre. And if you know his movies, be sure that ,as the other ones, Haywire deserves been watched. To sum it up, people are confused because it's an 80's action script, presented in an unorthodox way. That's the beauty of it. And Gina Carano, of course."

Permalink",False,"You have got to salute the marketing folks for giving Steven Soderbergh's Haywire such a high octane sounding synopsis that promises plenty of action given a plot that treads on the usual betrayal of an alpha-character who comes back to seek revenge against the handlers. The film isn't anything like what its synopsis had promised, being silent for the most parts and having little spoken segments, relying on plenty of mood and music generated, which reminded me of Drive, but without the coolness and chic since it's very much grounded in reality with no frills and no flamboyance.

And by that I mean no exaggeration in its fight action sequences, where sound effects usually get amplified and for some cinema, elevated to becoming a key component to camouflage the lack of hard hitting impact, which in real life hardly ever happens anyway unless someone possesses some out of this world bionics, or ability to whistle one's punches when punching through to another body. The fight choreography by JJ Perry and team is so vividly real that the choreography itself is invisible, where exponents rely on just about everything within grasp to be used as an advantageous weapon and use just about every component of one's body to gain tactical advantage, which is why MMA works. Everyone seems to hit very hard in very convincing fashion onto the other and go for the jugular, and never fail to make you wince when the fighters begin their no holds barred battles that can happen just about anywhere, anytime.

Which is why for the longest time I was waiting for yet another MMA film to show itself after Wilson Yip's Flashpoint, given the potential of the martial arts for more cinematic screen time, and who would have thought that it would come from Soderbergh instead, not exactly when known for tackling the pure out and out action genre in his filmography. But there's always a first time, and why not before the director decides to retire from filmmaking to dabble in painting. Curiously it's how the director had decided to treat the entire material, not just allowing the fights to take centrestage, but to weave a tale of curious jet setting espionage around it, dealing with shady characters with even shadier intents, and assemble a wealth of acting talent and action knuckle-men in its testosterone filled ensemble cast - check this out: Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton, Channing Tatum, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas etc - at his disposal to deliver on all fronts.

Before you go Gina Carano who? in terms of the lead actress on whose broad shoulders the weight of this film got carried upon, it's good background to know that she's a one time #3 in Unified Women's MMA Rankings, thus making her the genuine deal required of an action heroine, sorely missed in Hollywood these days, especially those who possess real skills and not poser ones that any camera can turn one into. While Haywire is not her debut feature film role, it doesn't mean that Carano already possesses that varied range of acting emotions, but reserves her range for her battling abilities instead, from hammering away at key anatomical parts, to gripping one's head in vice-like thighs, and so on. My personal favourite of her fight sequences happen to be that with Michael Fassbender, which began so suddenly, threw just about everything into it, and ended on a brutal yet anti-climatic note which deliberately stripped away all romanticism associated with on screen violence.

Somehow, watching this film is like watching a Bruce Lee film (who arguably is one of the first MMA proponents), where regardless of the plot we know who to align our emotions to, and are sitting on the edge of our seats just waiting for the scheme of things to pass so that our hero(ine) can begin to kick ass. There isn't much talk here by the leading character as she devotes herself to carrying out her mission and overcoming obstacles put in her way, and Soderbergh fashions the pace and mood of the film almost like a typical 80s B-action movie if not for its European trot from Barcelona to Dublin predominantly told in a series of flashbacks. MMA embodies plenty of fight utilizing just about every body part available to inflict damage, with its fair share of throws and grappling, and when done well like what Haywire features, can simply be engaging on the big screen.

Unfortunately the plot pales in comparison to its action and treatment, and you'll be holding your breath for the next big action sequence to come on screen in between the double crossing and scheming committed by men in power. It shouldn't have to be this way if Lem Dobbs' story managed to provide a proper emotional centre for its central lead, which would have made her less of a one-dimensional character. Still, it's action that had piqued one's interest to come see this, and thankfully that aspect didn't disappoint, save for the long waits in between to endure before you get rewarded for your patience."

Permalink",False,"People who are addicted to explosions and whizzbang special effects probably won't like this. But if you like a good story with very well done fight sequences, realistically portrayed rather than endlessly splashing gallons of fake blood about, then this is for you. And, Malory is seriously bad-ass. Not the normal Hollywood trumped up actor narcissistic look at my abs or boobs bad-ass, but seriously believable bad-ass. A rare treat for anyone who's tired of the flash-bang chop-scene madness currently infecting the silver screens.

Warning: You may have to use your brain to follow what's going on in this movie. It's well thought out, portrayed, and has a quality ending.

Warning #2: There are no scenes in this entire action film where anyone is impossibly missed by a thundering shower of bullets. Everything in this film is intelligently choreographed and believable. Very well done. Even the landing of punches sound about like what you would hear if you were watching a fight rather than like M80s exploding whenever someone flicks a finger."

Permalink",False,"We just saw the movie yesterday at ultra star poway. It was just AWFUL. The movie has no good fight scene. the only scenes that are watchable are in the trailer. It looks like a low budget cheap movie taken by a bad director. No story line, pathetic acting. I felt skinny girls like Uma Thurman , Angelina Jolie were more convincing as fighters in kill bill and salt. This movie should have IMDb rating of 2 not 7. Moreover the actress is neither cute nor has an extraordinary body. I really cannot believe she is a fighter. Looking at her I am motivated to fight. No body, she is just toned. Please do not think I am bashing her. Watch first 5 minutes of the movie and you will realize every word I am speaking is true. The movie was slow. They show as if she is globe trotting but we all know they are taken in some LA neighborhood. The direction and camera give it away. Overall PATHETIC

Permalink",False,"Stephen Soderbergh seems to consist of at least two persons. One Mr. Soderbergh makes clinic, verging on cold movies like ""Traffic"" or ""Contagion"" and the other Mr. Soderbergh just wants to have fun with ""Oceans 11"" or ""Oceans 12"". This one here is made by the ""Oceans 11""-Mr. Soderbergh. It contains lots of cool music, cool colors and cool people in cool clothes running through cool sets. Even the credits are cool! This film is so cool you can stick a tail to it and call it a weasel. Which, in the end, got a bit on my nerves. The film contains a plot that is hard to follow, which doesn't matter because it is irrelevant anyway, its main purpose is to look good. Which it does.

Do I hear that people compare it with ""Salt""? This is not a valid comparison. ""Salt"" relies on special effects and the star qualities of its main actress. ""Haywire"" has a nobody as main actress that beats up a line of stars (Antonio Banderas with potbelly and gold chain is just hilarious). And apart from a few bullet holes, there are no special effects. Gina Carano is the special effect. She does reasonable acting (you would expect an Ex-Marine-Assassin-For-Hire to be stone-faced anyway) and brilliant, absolutely brilliant stunts. Her fluid movements are a treat to watch. Who needs a plot with someone like this in the movie?

Maybe here is a parallel to the ""Contagion""-Mr. Soderbergh: he will not trick you and overwhelm you with all kinds of CGI explosions. He is well able to leave an impression with what's there, just by putting it in a new light. And on the roofs of Dublin there really IS a lot of barbed wire!

I'll give this one a good 7 and not more for trying so desperately to be cool."

Permalink",False,"I attended a prescreening of this movie and could not make it through the entire film. I have only ever walked out of one other movie and coincidentally it was a Steven Soderbergh film. This film has no plot, is unsuccessfully time jumpy and has an unlikeable female lead. The constant stream of jazz music is a pathetic attempt to capture the cool ""suave-ness"" of Soderbergh's ""Oceans"" franchise (which also sucked). Essentially, this film is a 1 hour and 33 minute compilation of the lead actress running.

The film industry seems to be trying to capitalize on the success of MMA stars within their movies ie: Randy Couture in The Expendables. However, surprisingly, in each instance the ""actors"" are no good at acting.

The Bourne franchise completely obliterates this attempt to mimic the super-spy genre. It is highly recommended that you do not waste your time with Haywire, and spend your 2 hours with any number of alternatives.

Permalink",False,"Steven Soderbergh's repertoire of 24 films within the past 22 years probably qualifies him as one of the most versatile directors in Hollywood, but his latest actioner 'Haywire' shows that even someone of his calibre has his limits. Essentially a B-grade movie wrapped up in an A-list package of stars, it is supposed to be the breakout vehicle of mixed martial arts champion Gina Carano- though it's hard to fathom how anyone would take notice of Carano when Soderbergh is too busy putting his audience to sleep.

Like most of his works, Soderbergh adopts a low-key down-to-earth vibe to his globe-trotting thriller- beginning first in a diner in upstate New York where covert operative Mallory Kane (Carano) meets a former partner Aaron (Channing Tatum). Their brief exchange of words soon escalates into a brutish melee, the first of many where Carano gets to show off her mean MMA moves (with some expert choreography by J. J. Perry) that will make any man think twice before messing with her.

'Woah' is the appropriate response in this instance, and should be the response every other time Carano gets to take out her enemies of the opposite sex- alas, Soderbergh does her and the movie a great disservice by his minimalist direction. Indeed, for the most part, there is a distinct sense that Soderbergh is simply content to point his camera and watch like a spectator while his actors go about their scenes, attempting little build-up in excitement or tension where such basic movie-making techniques would have mattered.

The detachment works in so far as the action is concerned- Carano is after all front and centre performing on her own every one of the stunts, and Soderbergh's cinematography (under his usual d.p alias of Peter Andrews) enables his audience to appreciate her physicality without having to put up with the annoying use of hand-held close-ups plaguing many action movies of late. But his unfussy style also means that his audience has to get through writer Lem Dobbs' unwieldy exposition that lacks the brevity and concision necessary for any action movie worth its salt.

So even as the action switches from Barcelona to Dublin where Mallory's earlier mission of rescuing a Chinese dissident journalist (Anthony Brandon Wong) turns out to be no more than a setup, the film never quite musters any genuine excitement at either location- and the sheer amount of talk that the characters engage in do it no favours. That is even more so when the intentions of the various characters become clear towards the end of the film, and what we thought may have been something smarter turned out to be nothing more than an unnecessarily convoluted setup for an otherwise simplistic plot.

Soderbergh also struggles to maintain a consistent tone for the movie, wavering between a classiness befitting of the 'Ocean's Eleven' movies (thanks in no small measure to returning composer David Holmes' jazzy score) and a grittiness befitting of his latest 'Contagion', both of which seem ill at ease in what is in actual fact a glorified B-movie. The ensemble cast however manage to make the best of their respective supporting roles. Antonio Banderas and Michael Douglas are appropriately smarmy as two shadowy Government figures responsible for Mallory's contract, while Bill Paxton is unexpectedly touching as Mallory's father. Michael Fassbender steals the show as a fellow operative contracted to take out Mallory, his hand-to-hand combat with Carano easily the best sequence in the whole film. Sadly, Ewan McGregor is miscast as Mallory's contact man Kenneth, nowhere more evident than in a painfully obvious choreographed showdown between him and Mallory on the beach.

And on hindsight, it may not have been a wise move to cast these actors (with the exception of Fassbender) against Carano. None of them are Carano's match, and as any Asian action star (pick Donnie Yen or Tony Jaa for instance) can tell you, a worthy opponent goes a long way in an action movie. Soderbergh is also let down by his own disinclination for the material, as his art-house touch ultimately drains the movie of the sheer adrenaline thrills it should pack. It's clear to see why Soderbergh had taken the trouble to build a movie around a newcomer, but unfortunately, this star-driven vehicle goes exactly where its title suggests."

Permalink",False,"Steven Soderbergh Is A Master. ""Haywire"" Is An Excellent Film And Arguably The Great Action Film Ever. The Cast Is Extraordinary And Includes Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Bill Paxton, Michael Douglas, Channing Tatum, Antonio Banderas, And Gina Carano In Her Film Debut. The Action Is Riveting And Fluid. The Film Lacks The Choppy Editing Of Most Action Movies And Just Delivers Great Cinematic Fight Sequences. I Must Say That I Don't Care For Action Films, But I Absolutely Loved ""Haywire"". The Film Features Some Of The Best Actors In The World. Gina Carano Is A Fantastic Action Heroine Who I Would Love To See More Of. Carano Is An MMA Fighter With No Acting Experience. Soderbergh Know This And He Contstructs The Film Accordingly By Playing To Carano's Strengths. I Loved The Film's Gorgeous Cinematography And The Brilliant Choreography. ""Haywire"" Is Soderbergh At His Very Best And Absolutely My Favorite Action Film In Cinema History.

Permalink",False,"I have to say even though I know this film isn't for everyone, I'm really surprised by how negative the reaction has been towards it on this site. I really loved what Steven Soderbergh did with this film. He took a concept that we've seen done over and over again, and turned into something that felt fresh and original. I loved the films visual style and the fight scenes were excellent! Gina Carano did a great job in the lead role and the rest of the cast did a good job as well. This felt much more gritty and realistic and less like a Hollywood Action Thriller. In some ways, it kinda reminded me of 2011's art-house action drama Drive. It's not a film thats going to be for everyone, but those who are looking for something different will really enjoy this.

Permalink",True,"This film is tale of two movies. We have one part of the film, the action scenes with kick ass Gina Carano, who looks to me to be on verge of being the next great female action star. Then we have everything else about the film. Is there enough superlative action to make this film great despite the everything else? Sadly the answer to this question is no. This film joins a long line of films from celebrated auteur Soderbergh that I have been less than impressed with. The last film he directed that I really enjoyed was 2001's Ocean's Eleven and that was eleven years ago. Perhaps much like Samson Soderbergh has lost his powers.

I actually thought that the fight choreography in the film was amazing. The fight scenes were brutal and believable. Gina Carano could snap your neck like a pencil and that certainly gave the fight scenes and air of authenticity. I also have to give props to Peter Andrew (Soderbergh pseudonym) for his excellent cinematography and the interesting angles of the fight and chase scenes. This was the part of the film I enjoyed and thought was well done. The rest of the film seemed to consist of a list actors sort of mumbling and mailing it in with half hearted efforts. Who knew going in that Carano would have to attempt to carry the whole picture herself check out our full review at 3guys1movie.com

Permalink",False,"This is a must see. I saw trailers and was intrigued. I saw the cast and was sold. I watch dozens of movies each week and this was by far the best I have seen in months. Some reviewer said Gina's acting was stiff. Hardly. She was far better than Angelina Jolie could ever be. Why? Because she really knows how to fight. Every one of the actors who had to fight her in the movie said they were intimidated. From the interview with Ewan McGregor, he said that in the fight scene on the beach, he was supposed to swing at her and miss her head. Well, he swung, but hit her square on the side of the head and knocked her over. Then she came up and said ""Are you OK?"" That was hilarious. And the last ten seconds of the movie were the best. Antonio Banderas, who is a badass in many movies isn't so much in this one.

Permalink",False,"With Cynthia Rothrock considered yesterday's news and the film world over-enamored with Milla Jovovich in her over-produced blockbusters, it really surprises me that a movie like HAYWIRE could still be made under the Hollywood umbrella. Not only is an action movie starring a woman getting the big-name treatment, but it's an action movie starring a genuine fighter and not some stunt-doubled dramatic actor. While most of the professional cage brawlers who've made it to the film world have had to slug it out in some remarkably bad low-budget fare (e.g. NEVER SURRENDER), MMA heroine Gina Carano lucks out with a great director and a surprisingly good cast in a pretty satisfying CIA revenge flick that could easily become the foundation of a very promising career.

The story: Black ops operative Mallory Kane (Carano) embarks on an intercontinental mission to find out why she was betrayed by her allies...

I can easily see why the general, non- action-oriented public might not like this movie. Director Steven Soderbergh is definitely one of contemporary Hollywood's best, and because this isn't TRAFFIC, people who aren't in it for the punches and kicks might consider it a step down for him. Additionally, even I was surprised by this one's cast: I would have expected to find Channing Tatum, but Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor, and Michael friggin' Douglas? It's as though Steven Soderbergh called in some favors and bets he won... Truthfully, some of these big names aren't necessary to the film - Michael Douglas' role as a CIA director could've easily been played by someone else - so again, some viewers who will watch this film for name recognition are chancing disappointment when these big stars end up not doing too much. With that said, everybody generally does well and you have to hand it to star Gina Carano for making the most of her first major role: even when not kicking butt, her dramatic offering is more than acceptable.

Of course, the main reason I saw the film was for the butt-kicking, and I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. Mixed martial arts movies contradict my belief that the best fight scenes are produced by low-budget fare where choreographical creativity can be embellished and not stifled by the whims of producers: while the majority of direct-to-video MMA movies have featured truly awful fight scenes, Hollywood seems to have a better bead on how to make the most of ""realistic"" fighting, and HAYWIRE is a great example. Carano has six fights of varying lengths throughout the film, and to say that she uses them to redefine how powerful a woman can appear on screen is an understatement. Even though I like only four of these brawls (which include a stand-up battle against Ewan McGregor of all people), they're good enough to make me reconsider the place of mixed martial arts in movies. The fights are, for the most part, well-shot and Carano displays the same sort of brutal efficiency as in her Strikeforce career, though she's not above the occasional flashy move like a rebounding roundhouse off the wall. When it comes to looking like she really means it but still being entertaining, Gina's got few equals.

The production is strong, which should be a given in a Soderbergh movie. Some of the European scenes are shot on location, others are fudged, but it all looks authentic. The film doesn't try to do anything aesthetically new, but as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't need to: unless you're particularly needy of car chases and explosions, this movie delivers what an action picture should and does it with a complete lack of pretense. My only major qualm? - the ending comes from out of nowhere and bit too soon for my taste, but I can live with this. Definitely worth a watch."

Permalink",False,"Mallory Kane is a paid operative--an agent who is one of the best in the business. However, when the film begins, someone she thinks is a friend tries to kill her--and the action doesn't stop there. But why are all these folks shooting at her? Who is behind it? All this is for Mallory to discover...if she manages to survive.

""Haywire"" is an amazing film. After all, it stars a relatively unknown actress (Gina Carano) and yet is make by one of the top directors and features cameos from some top stars. Clearly, they feel Ms. Carano can be a top star herself--and I strongly agree. However, I do not agree that this is a great showcase for her. While it's a good film, it has one huge problem--a confusing plot that you really don't need! Her latest film, ""In the Blood"" has a much simpler plot and allows the real star of the movie to shine--Carano's INSANE fighting skills! Her MMA and Muay Thai training clearly are seen in both films--and she makes Van Damme and the other male action stars look like pansies. She does all the stunts, she gets tossed around like a rag doll and she probably has a lot of bruises to show for it! But, she also has some amazing films-- filled with intense action and which will get your adrenalin pumping."

Permalink",True,"The trailers for Steven Soderbergh's ""Haywire"" promised me a solid cast and some serious fight scenes. It delivered on both counts, but deflated when the fists weren't flying. YouTube any of the TV spots for this thing, and you'll see that the fists and feet of fury were the centerpiece of the entire marketing campaign. Those ad guys knew what they were doing. But they were selling something akin to ""Salt"" or even a lady ""Bourne"", when the real thing is a much more stylish (dare I say, ""arty"") piece of violent espionage.

And while I was entertained, Soderbergh's brand of cool groove and style is better suited to the crime and caper flick. ""Haywire"" becomes bogged down in the quiet talky scenes, leaving you antsy for the next fight sequence. And it grinds to a halt in the third act when things become Bill Paxton-centric. But that's my primary beef, and were it not for this, ""Haywire"" would be a solid 8.5

But it still has plenty going for it. For one, it's very well-cast. Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Antonio Banderas and Michael Douglas all give engaging performances (especially Douglas). For any of ""Haywire""'s faults, that at least can be counted on. There's some fine scenery, as well (especially Bill Paxton's house; great location). It's also very well-scored (Soderbergh + David Holmes = Win-Win), and Holmes supplies the lion's share of the film's groove. The one thing I really hate about this movie (might be a nitpick, I'm not sure) is the voice they dubbed in for Gina Carano. Can't stand that ADR voice; it sounds like a professional voice-over actress for a cosmetics commercial. Carano did the press junket for this thing, her voice isn't a secret. And her voice is ear candy! What the hell, Soderbergh?

Which brings me to the main event, the sweet spot, the pi√®ce de r√©sistance: Ms. Carano. That they cast an MMA fighter injects the fight scenes with undeniable authenticity. And those fight scenes are lean, in-your-face and fist-pumpingly brutal (that seaside fight where McGregor gets his ass kicked was particularly satisfying). But even if you don't have a violence fetish, you can't take your eyes off of Carano. To watch this woman work is a true thing of beauty. Something to behold, fear, and ultimately shake your head in astonishment over. The wrestling holds, the parkour, the swift attacks ... And those legs! My god, I want to be a woman just to I can envy Carano for having gams like that! When she unloaded that monster kick on Fassbender in that dress ... hoo boy. Yeah, I know, I'm gonna stop now.

But for its faults, it's ""Haywire""'s final shot that leaves me with a beaming grin on my face; just the right high note to skip out on. It brands an indelible impression on the viewer as to the focus of the movie: a highly trained woman beating the snot out of her male counterparts. That spy business is just fluff; something to give seasoned actors some dialogue to work with. We all come here for the lady and we all damn well know it.

Permalink",False,"My attention was drawn to this movie when I was watching an interview with Gina Carano about her potentially coming back to UFC to compete and needless to say, I'm glad that I watched it. I've always been a huge fan of action films with female actresses as the leading characters. I love that women have been able to break away from the ""damsel in distress"" roles and show that they can hold a power roll in action films just like men. Carano does just this, but better!

Yes, the plot is very simple and clich√©, but that's not why I like the film. It was very different from many other action films. It was very evident that Carano actually KNEW what she was doing! You could see that she knew how to throw a punch, land a kick, and do ground work. The fights were so well choreographed AND believable! Not only is Carano gorgeous, but she can fight! According to an interview, Carano said she did about 98% of her own stunts. That's amazing! It looked real, which for me, that's what really sold this movie.

Permalink",False,"This was very different from expected. The trailer makes us think this is a lame action movie. I had decided not to see this. Then it fell into my hands, and since it was a Soderbergh movie, and a saw a couple of ratings giving 5 of 6, I gave it a shot.

I thought this film was confusing in the beginning, and very different from what I expected, but I really think the film is getting more and more sublime as it goes forward. It jumps in time, throughout, making it confusing, but it's really just to relax. You'll get it in the end.

I think this is what a realistic double crossing of an agent would be like. No silliness, just plain and realistic, as the fighting scenes, which was great. No Hollywood silly stupid action, just good.

The music and colored scenes (yellow and blue filtering) as well as th jazzy music is paying homages to 70ies agent films.

This is no action flick. This is artistic filmmaking, paying tributes and homages. This is art. I thought Mia Carno was great. I never saw her, and I found the fighting scenes very realistic. A pleasant watch with an agent with a heart.

Not what I expected, but good. A 7 out of 10, and a typical Soderbergh-movie."

An action flick that, at first sight when reading the topic, seemed to remind me Lara Croft crap. I was afraid of that, I must confess. But I was finally pretty surprised when watching this film. I won't see it again, although. But the action sequences are splendidly made, so astonishing. I thought of the Cronenberg's films: HISTORY OF VIOLENCE or EASTERN PROMISES. I was so surprised by this sudden brutality. Yes, I repeat, nothing to do with other action programmers. The story is very hard to follow in detail. This actress gives here a wonderful performance. A real female athlete. I don't think we'll see her in house wives - cooking or going to school to get their children - characters.

Permalink",False,"This film scored 6/10 at a push because of some of the performances and the effects. 'Haywire' was a film I was quite excited about seeing because of its spectacular cast.

The plot disappointed me; it was a fairly basic idea but they somehow managed to make it far more complicated than it had to be. They chose not to explain exactly why everyone was after Mallory but half-way through the film you had already pieced together the plot anyway and were left waiting patiently for them to finally explain it. When they do (right at the end of the film) it is done in a way that just makes you confused when you didn't have to be. They eventually explain the goings on with a small montage of people walking down corridors mumbling to one another with loud music over the top so you have to put subtitles on just to hear. The ending was rushed and sloppy and tried to add a pathetic touch of humour with Antonio Banderas' words at the end but because it has been so rushed you're still annoyed.

Most of the acting was done really well; Gina Carano has made a great first feature film performance in this and I hope she makes a decent career out of this but I doubt it. Additional performances by Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas and especially Channing Tatum and Bill Paxton should also be noted. The last two's performances were too short however and deserved more screen time. The one problem I had with the acting was Ewan MacGregor who played the main antagonist in a way. Why anyone thought he would be able to give a powerful performance in such a central part of the story is bizarre; he is bland, has no on-screen presence in this film and actively drains any energy in a scene out of it.

The stunts and effects in this film should be noted; it's been a while since I've seen fight scenes where it really does look like the people are fighting each other and causing serious harm. The fight scenes are really well choreographed too and are the main reason why I scored this film so high because in a way these scenes carried the entire film.

I'm really disappointed with Steven Soderbergh because he has made some excellent films in his past. This film started out really good but by the end of it you just felt empty."

Plus, what is up with some of the reviewers on here boo hooing that people don't love the film, stating that ""we don't get the film""? Oh we get the film, but were hungry for more.

Permalink",False,"Soderbergh may not have so much a bright visual imagination, but he is an honest, alert mind. He likes to puzzle about what it means to film, and has tackled at least two projects that underachieve in ambitious ways, one of them inherited from Malick. He has a grasp of film mechanics. So every time I sit down with him, reviews be damned, I prepare myself for introspective viewing. I expect layers of an onion to peel.

I've said it again; his predicament is that he lacks a New Wave to belong to. So he films for an audience that will likely fail to appreciate subtleties in his work, a little like DePalma in this respect.

Admittedly, this is a bit thin. One layer down we have the Bourne plot about a female covert ops agent framed by mysterious circumstances and looking for agency that moves the world, on the level of reality she is narrating the story to us and making sure we keep track of names and connections, then merging of the two layers and more super-spy stuff. Barcelona, Dublin, New Mexico, VeraCruz, Majorca, the places we visit. Her dad is a writer of military books, but we're told they have thin characters, like our film.

The sorry aspect of the film is not that, like it or not, it cannot help but bring to mind Kill Bill. It's exercise without mind, a simple flexing of visual muscles, for instance the multicamera approach to the Barcelona operation.

My theory is that every film can be improved with just a few tweaks, by deepening the anchors in the story. So, how about an ambiguously unreliable narrator, so no solid footing in reality, and inside the story being told stress emphasis on the WikiLeaks aspect and Chinese journalist. If you are like me, you find appealing the notion that WikiLeaks started with the wrong PC being used by Chinese whisteblowers as a nod in a TOR network.

So a deeper causality than simply money moves the world. The pursuit would be of truth. The idea would be to have undercurrents between a story and identities being leaked that we have no way to know are true and not manipulated, and leaked documents that conceal or reveal part of the conspiracy while being a part of it. And leverage inside of that a deep-web infrastructure that seems shady but is in fact impersonal bureaucracy. The environment would be post-noir. The trigger an accident, in keeping with the birth of WikiLeaks.

Maybe Soderbergh was merely flexing here because he was essaying a similar idea in Contagion. Too bad he didn't combine the two, this has a more appealing skeleton.

The one revelation here is Gia Carano. She has the natural sexy cool of a Steve McQueen. More of her please."

Permalink",False,"This film satisfies.

Specifically the urge to watch a female protagonist square off with a male in hand-to-hand combat, and realistically win.

I've never considered how ill-equipped women are for fist-fighting. But that's probably a good thing.

With the long hair, the unstable shoe heels, and simply the lack of body mass for throwing punches; in reality, most male vs. female altercations won't result in sophisticated brawls.

And I suppose that's why we rarely see it in film. When reviewing Captain America: The Winter Soldier I mentioned how we never get enough combat from Black Widow, played by Scarlett Johansson.

Anyway.

Haywire is great.

The writing, directing, editing, casting, soundtrack/scoring and acting is fantastic. The fights are awesome.

Steven Soderbergh may be my favorite director. His movies never disappoint.

Side Effects podiums amongst the top three films of 2013. You may know him from the Oceans Eleven franchise, Traffic or Out of Sight.

Gina Carano's biography on IMDb claims Soderbergh, ""wrote the role of Mallory Kane specifically for her,"" though the screenplay's written by Lem Dobbs (who also wrote The Limey, another famous Soderbergh flick.)

I knew I recognized Gina C. She plays a great character in Fast & Furious 6!

Others may know her as the famous MMA fighter.

If you see the movie, you'll understand why Soderbergh's such a great director. The action is entirely more riveting without stunt doubles.

I dig that Gina Carano. She's charismatic and lovable as the protagonist. Let's hope we see more of her in future films.

The chase scenes are quietly spectacular. The plot moves along at a break-neck pace so you have to pay attention.

There's something about the on-foot chase scene that's gripping. When it really feels like the characters are sprinting for long periods of time, it's so engaging.

Haywire's stylishly edited and utilizes innovative storytelling techniques. One scene cuts between three different types of footage to show a trio of plots developing simultaneously. Plus, there's no in-scene audio or dialogue, just the musical score.

It's very cool! And slightly confusing. So pay attention!

The supporting cast is spectacular.

Channing Tatum never disappoints.

Ewan McGregor doing quality Ewan.

Bill Paxton doing quality Paxton.

Anotonio Banderas. Michael Douglas.

Michael Fassbender!

Come on. What more do you need?

Haywire is a top-notch action thriller available for HD rental through Xfinity OnDemand, Amazon or iTunes for $3.99.

There's nothing special during the credits.

But it's 93 minutes, and it's an R-rated flick that men and women will both enjoy.

You might call it a great 'date movie'."

Permalink",False,"""Haywire"" is one of the smartest, stylish and surprisingly zippiest of recent spy genre films in recent memory. It's a C-movie that delivers an A-movie experience. It's pretty fun, too.

Credit director Steven Soderbergh: this is a low-class fad-gimmick (instead of kickboxing, it's MMA) genre movie as-if filtered through the huge talent of ace screenwriter Lem Dobbs. Soderbergh has nothing to prove other than he's amusing himself with how seamlessly easy he can do these things (the Oceans 11 films come to mind). It's not only giddy, but infectious.

Soderbergh's choices of production design, editing and style are endlessly cool and very 1970s. This film is a movie geek fever-dream of what might happen if an ""A"" director (like Soderbergh) would ever lower himself to direct an 1980's Cannon action film - only this time with a bigger budget and a few more brains.

In classic would-be cult form, the film is built around a MMA non-actor like Gina Carino, but this time the cast is filled to the edges of the frame with a first-rate actors like Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Channing Tatum, Bill Paxton and Antonio Banderas. In her first film role, Carino is more than game for a first-time thesp, and she rises to the crackerjack cast that is surrounding her.

It's such a pleasure to watch this film unspool - the action is tight, the feel is stylish, energetic and exciting, and it seems that everyone in the production is in on the joke that this is way MORE that what it really ever should be.

""Haywire"" may be slight, but it's another easy win for director Soderbergh. Similar to the UK's Michael Winterbottom, Soderbergh aptly wears a crown of a multi-disciplined genre king. He's a machine, cranking out top-flight entertainments with an ease and steady hand - moving effortlessly between drama, comedy and action and even experimental storytelling - and scenario tropes high and low-brow.

Soderbergh's technical mastery makes these kind of ""assigments"" both interesting and pleasing. ""Haywire"", although genre-serving, is no exception."

Permalink",False,"Real life female mixed martial arts star Gina Carano convincingly beats up the blokes in this lean Steven Soderbergh action thriller. Brimming with star turns and ignoring any kind of over complexity, Soderbergh's film is all about tempo. Instead of using rapid fire cutting to accentuate and heighten danger, (Chris Nolan/Paul Greengrass anyone?) the camera just holds to pay witness to the exhilarating action. Script and plot are borderline non-existent, and Ewan McGregor's American accent slips around a little, but from the off it's all about Carano doing her stuff supported by an impressive A-list cast. Does she do it well? Oh yes! While the film isn't going to leave a lasting impression, it's star certainly does. On a few occasions now i've seen Angelina Jolie pummel guys three times her size into the ground and although Jolie has the acting smarts, somehow the sight of her skinny frame doing extensively lethal damage has yet to fully convince. You can forget that with Carano, from the off she writes a new book on the female action star as she looks more than a match for any of her male opponents. Carano dishes out the brutality while at the same time remaining beautiful and alluring. It's a curious mix and an inspired piece of casting, more the shame that the film itself lacks better ideas to support it's eye catching protagonist. 7/10"

Permalink",False,"Haywire is a high-octane intelligence thriller with Gina Carano as the smart, sexy, efficient lead calling all the shots, even after it all comes crashing down.

Carano (Mallory Kane) heads a star-studded cast including Michael Fassbender (Paul), Michael Douglas (Alex Coblenz), Ewan McGregor (Kenneth), Bill Paxton (Eric), and Channing Tatum (Aaron). Despite being the lone female lead amidst a top notch crew of Hollywood's finest male talent, Carano flawlessly pulls it off. The hand-to-hand fighting and action scenes are her strong suit, not the weak dialogue.

Permalink",False,"I didn't know where Haywire was taking me, but when I got there I was satiated.

Haywire has a tight, well edited plot-line, with lots of turns and twists, but the final plot answers are only being revealed at the finish. But even then, many of the characters and their motives are left open. In many ways it reminded me of ghost protocol, but shorter & lighter.

The script is my version of superior - it's spare, crisp, and to the point. And the action scenes feel like they are choreographed - and they are absorbing.

And finally, the protagonist is a new female action star in making. Maybe not the greatest actress yet, but an action star yes. I can't wait for the sequel.

My rating: 8 out-of 10.

Permalink",True,"HAYWIRE (2011) *** Gina Carano, Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Bill Paxton, Michael Angarano. Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh's too-cool-for-school spy vs. spy action set piece tailor made for MMA Corano (in her big-screen debut) as a wet-ops agent seeking answers and revenge ‚Äì not necessarily in that order ‚Äì when she's targeted for death with some loose ends to be tightened (preferably around her double-crossers' collective throats). Lean-and-mean screenplay by Lem Dobbs (who collaborated with Soderbergh on the criminally underrated indie gem THE LIMEY) sets things in motion with the beautifully lethal Carano (chosen personally by Soderbergh for her sweet skills in kicking some serious ass) up to the task in basically beating the snot out of her dubious co-stars. Shrewdly directed (i.e. the fights are thankfully not a chop-chop edited m√©lange of WTF just happened; clean and visible and Real! And altering Carano's voice to have a huskier tone is an interesting conceit) with razor-sharp pacing and just enough intrigue to keep the pot boiling. A veteran ensemble cast and the globe-trotting usual plotting mixed in the blend comes across as a toxic tonic for the espionage gone awry crowd. Best bit: Fassbender's pas-de-deux with our Wonder Woman (indeed); I'm in love.

Permalink",False,"This is the best kind of action film. One in which we actually granted the pleasure of watching bodies move. Haywire is low on gaudy explosions, which have become the best position of most action movies as the fireworks have gotten bigger, louder and more elaborate, they've come to mean almost nothing. And although there is a car crash of sorts in Haywire, it's a too amusing one that's ingenious in its simplicity. When Soderbergh does action, less is more. He's more interested in watching Carano, and he's betting we will be, too: Her muscles are obviously mighty, yet they have the softness of feminine curves ‚Äì Mallory is a mixed-message heroine for sure, which is part of what makes her compelling. That Carano does all her own stunts, of course, only adds to the allure. Watching a woman being hurled against a flat-screen TV might not ordinarily be my idea of fun, but it's clear Carano can take it, and land on her feet like all of the violence in Haywire, the moment is brutal and laced with grim humor.I will Give 10/10 for this best action movie.

Haywire was filmed in a way, you did not really know what was going on & tried to hard to be clever with its camera movement, but instead ended up just giving me a headache & made it harder to understand. They dubbed the girls voice to make it deeper, which is quite noticeable in some scenes, especially when it becomes too loud at parts. There was far too many characters than needed in the film, this also added to the confusion. All the big names appear very little & were clearly only in the film for a bit of extra cash.

It just felt like they had spent most of the budget on marketing & getting some famous actors to help sell it. I would not recommend it, the film is NOT like the Bourne films in any way, it lacked any suspense...especially as the majority of the fight scenes had no backing sound to help create a mood. A big disappointment! Save your money & wait till it appears on the TV (no doubt sometime soon) so you can watch it for free and then happily turn it off after half hour of viewing!"

Permalink",True,"I had friends warn me about seeing this movie, but the idea behind the plot, and the couple trailers seemed intriguing. However, for 90 minutes, you sit, watch, and wait for the plot to really start, and then it's over.

With a cast like Michael Douglas, Antonio Bendares, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton, and even Channing Tatum, you would expect there to be much more action, suspense, and most of all, talented acting and performances. But even these actors performance fell massively flat and uninteresting.

This movie was made for only one reason, to attempt to show off the MMA talents of Gina Carano, who plays the lead female character. I hope she fights better in MMA than she does in this movie because the fights are unbelievable, and suck wind. And as far as acting, I've seen animals with greater range of emotion, and performance standards. At one point, she runs at the screen and stops in a close up and says ""You better run."" I should have about an hour before it got to that point, but by then I'd already invested too much time to not finish.

Save yourself the money, do not buy or rent. Wait till it's on TV, which if the universe is very kind, it never will be.

Gina Carano's performance is excellently matched to the role and she plays the part well, although it will be interesting to see where she go's from here.

Permalink",False,"Having just gotten back from seeing ""Haywire"", I say that it's one of the best spy films I've ever seen. Starring Gina Carano, along with an A-list cast and one of the most innovative and exciting action scenes ever put to film with plot twists, and eye-popping stunts.

What I like best about this film is how character driven it is. Though I like action, I'm mostly into character development and plot and ""Haywire"" has this in bucket loads. Some of the plot is a bit rough and sketchy, but it is coherent and easy to follow. I was a little confused at some aspects of the plot and certain character motivations, but I was on the edge of my seat when things kick into high gear as the race to clear her name gives way to some hog-wild antics.

But the best thing about it all is that it's not just a spy thriller, it's also a noir thriller. That's something seldom seen in the genre and rarely does it get pulled off successfully but Steven Sodeberg manages to do just that. This could be the start of a new genre of spy movies mixed with hard-boiled detective like action. But as dark as this film may be, it's got moments of humor that really work well within the film's dark atmosphere.

The acting is great but it is Gina Carano that makes this film. With unflinching charm with her lioness-like eyes, this is one woman you don't really wanna mess with. But she's also vulnerable too, physically and emotionally. In terms of physical prowess with a voluptuous figure to boot, she's FAR more convincing and believable than Zoe Saldana's ""Columbiana""(how anyone believes a 90 lbs woman can kick enemies twice her size I would never understand) My only gripe is that she didn't have more emotional depth. True this is her first feature film role and an impressive one at that, but I would've liked to have seen her emote more so that the audience can better emphasize with her. Maybe there's a director's cut of the film that adds more than the theatrical release but that would have to wait. Until then audiences should be thrilled with this film nonetheless.

For a first time effort, I was really impressed with this film. It's got action, but character development and plot is much more prominent. The lack of more action may turn off some, but I liked this film more because it actually has a plot and characters you really care about. That's something today's action films need. Haywire fits the bill perfectly in my book and it's much more convincing then Underworld: Awakening. A film that's more about flash than substance."

Permalink",False,"Don't know what Steven Soderbergh was thinking this time. Having some of the marvelous hits in recent past under his belt, Haywire literally went out of proportion by the Director himself.

Weakest link in all that drama was the main role itself. Soderbergh experimenting with an athlete who wasn't even fit to act in a B-movie. Gina is surrounded by such an extraordinary mainstream cast and she literally messed it up for everyone. You can see her face set to one expression from the start till the end which was more like, 'look at me, I'm bad ass'.

Having a presence of superb actors around like Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor or even Channing Tatum wasn't enough to save an athlete turned 'non actor' called Gina Carano.

Thats how bad she was.

Im sure I'm not the only person who loves Steven Soderbergh's work and i still cant accept the fact that he failed to crave out the talent (if it was there) from Gina."

Permalink",False,"Something went haywire with Haywire. The lead actress was good, and very athletic, and the cinematography was good too, but the problem was with the story. There was at most a rudimentary facsimile of a story. The movie had the look of a potboiler, right off the assembly-line. For stunt doubles, this movie must have been a bonanza. But alas, a movie is more than just a collection of stunts. It has to have a viable story or the movie becomes stale and this movie proves that point. When a movie loads up the celluloid with action, it's usually a sign that the movie is lacking in other departments. If you like watching a lovely lad running around, getting into skirmishes and occasionally speaking, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, wait for the movie to go to DVD land.

Permalink",False,"Greetings again from the darkness. Caught an early screening of this one and my quick description is that it's a mash-up of The Bourne Identity, Salt, and the original Mod Squad (a retro feel). In other words, it's a fun ride full of stunning fight scenes filmed with an artistry only director Steven Soderbergh can achieve.

Newcomer Gina Carano stars as Mallory Kane, an independent contractor ... the type who handles dirty work for governments and powerful people who must keep their hands somewhat clean. She gets double-crossed on a Barcelona job and becomes the target herself while in Dublin. So this lethal weapon goes on a globe-trotting mission of revenge and messes up people and hotel rooms in the process. If you think a woman can't carry action scenes, then you don't realize Ms. Carano is an MMA fighter. She is the real deal. Her physical skills are on full display and leave little doubt as to her deadly talent.

Since this is a Soderbergh film, you know the cast is well-stocked. We get Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas and Ewan McGregor all at their smarmy best. Additionally we see Michael Fassbender, Channing Tatum and Bill Paxton (as Mallory's father). Trust me when I say not all of these character fare so well in their showdowns with Mallory. Though the script from Lem Dobbs is pretty basic, Soderbergh's way of telling the story is compelling enough to keep us interested between Carano's fights.

The color palette alternates between the brown/gold Soderbergh used for Traffic, and the blue/gray from his Ocean's franchise. The jazzy score from David Holmes is a wonderful compliment to the wide variety of scenes and locations, and the tongue-in-cheek humor is expert enough to keep you smiling through the all too serious business chats. A perfect example is the use of a particular S-word to both begin and end the movie.

Soderbergh is one of the few directors who refuses to get pigeon-holed into making a certain type of movie. Never short on style or visual flair, he touches many genres and here proves he can twist the action-thriller in a new, fun to watch direction. If you kick back and go for the ride, Haywire will show you a great time.

a note of trivia: Gina Carano is the daughter of former Dallas Cowboy quarterback Glenn Carano"

Permalink",True,"Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is having lunch somewhere in New York. Aaron (Channing Tatum) joins in to chat with her. We don't know what there really talking about, but we know that something is not right. A brawl between Mallory and Aaron breaks out, but Scott (Michael Angarano), a costumer in the dinning room, intervene and helps Mallory. She takes Scott's car and him as well and explains her background. Flashback, she works as a contractor who is employ for the American Government. Her boss Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) assigns her next mission. Her mission is to pose as the wife of British agent Paul (Michael Fassbender) and extract information from Studer (Mathieu Kassovitz). As the mission progress Mallory realize that Kenneth wants to take her out permanently. Upon arriving at the hotel, Paul tries to kill her but she fights back and kills him instead. She is now a fugitive, but she is willing to hunt those who tried to betray her.

In today's world of cinema, usually the action sequences are often fast pace and fast edit. In Haywire it is not the case because it is different. Most of the action sequences in this film are long take and I mean long. An average take is approximately 2-3 second per take, in this film its twenty second per take. That is usual for but then again this is Steven Soderbergh, who usually does long take. Here's what surprised me, Haywire has a plot that makes logical sense compare to other action films that has been released lately. Yes, sometimes it can be clich√© because of how predictable the plot is, but overall the plot is not bad. The acting is bad too, but newcomer Gina Carano kicks ass, literally. Most of her fights were done by her instead of a stuntwoman. Soderbergh is also known for having great cinematography and he once again he accomplishes that. Although Haywire is only one hour and thirty minutes long, for some reason I found it to be slow because in my theory Soderbergh wanted the audience to focus on the plot than the action scenes but that didn't work and here's why. While conducting research, the film was rated D- in Cinemascope report card, which means that audiences panned the film, however it was praised by critics (the movie received a fresh on rotten tomatoes with an 81%), which is rare for that to happen because usually it's the opposite. One thing I did hate was that the ending should have extended. I can't say why because I don't like to spoil the movie.

Haywire is a usual action film, which is the reason why I like it. I will say this; it is not for everyone and especially those who are into action genres because of how different it is in terms of style and pacing. Haywire is so far the best action film of this year and I'm going to give it¬Ö

If I get lucky and one of my books gets turned into a movie and this director came to me wanting to direct it.... I'd tell him to bugger off. Hell No! I can understand wanting to make a movie artsy and using special cinematography for a special look, but this was just horrible. Ridiculous soundtrack, stupid lighting, boring dialog, Yawn!

Permalink",False,"A few buddies (MMA fans) wanted to see this one, and the IMDb and rotten tomatoes numbers were not horrible (82% on RT right now!), so I was game. Suffice it to say, this was an awful pile. This movie was 1:30 and could easily have been edited down to about 35 minutes. And then it would still suck, but it would have saved me about an hour.

There's no character development, no relationship development, no character that you give a rat's end about, thin plot, horrible dialogue, and a whole lot of dead time. There's low-speed chases, long sequences of no dialogue (which can be good, but not here), and huge plot holes. Oh, and lousy acting.

The best part was a car accident reminiscent of Tommy Boy, and that was only for the presumably unintentional comedy. The only other point of interest was the score, which at times sounded like the Doors and Pink Floyd mashed up. But it probably only got noticed because of the ridiculous amount of dead space in this movie.

My friends have low standards for movies, and they HATED it. So there you have it. I may be done with Soderbergh."

Perhaps a freeze per frame version of Bourne as the fist action scenes were painfully slow. This movie didn't go anywhere and I had read comments that the story was non existent and how right they were! I think the Director was pulling in some favours to get A list actors on this flick but give them 5 years and this will be the one movie they wish they didn't touch.

Permalink",False,"I wanted to title my review ""Steven Soderbergh !"", because they say he's a great director (for instance, before writing this review, I watched Catherine Zeta-Jones saying it, so convinced, in an interview), while after seeing plenty of his work, and now Haywire, I didn't run into this so-called greatness at all !

Apparently the producers wanted to make a Gina Carano vehicle, to launch her as a new martial arts star. Therefore, they put her in the leading role of an action spy thriller, hired half of Hollywood's stars to be around her, and brought director known as great (for no obvious reason); all to fail miserably !

Carano has neither acting talent nor charisma. Her face is just dead. Thus her reactions were all along boring.

The directing is boring, boring, and boring. Soderbergh isn't your typical thriller action movie director, or else. He failed in coming up with the usual, or any good unusual stuff. He thought that changing the pace, to slower, would make his thriller as genius. Well, it ended up as not genius... or bearable !

I hate this script wrathfully. First off it's unoriginal. I have seen all of it, and I mean ALL OF IT, previously in endless movies. The lead seems as a girly, no amnesiac, version of Bourne in Bourne movies, and the movie looks like Nikita 2 : The Revenge, or Kill Bill: Vol. 3 ! Then, it is ridiculously sophisticated and dully dark. For little instance it has unclear dialog about unclear matters; as if the writer of the movie is from CIA, and doesn't want to tell anything, otherwise will be sued ! So, it leaves you with not many questions, rather all the questions. Let alone that while it doesn't want to make itself clear, this movie doesn't make a fair thrill along the way too. Originally, how to make a thrill while the viewer doesn't interact with his heroine, doesn't understand a thing, and finally doesn't care about such a boring movie anyway ???!!! In brief, I was watching a series of escapes, murders and flashbacks, without any comprehension or enjoyment !

With this script I was screaming ""Be Understood"", and with the lazy cutting, my screams changed to ""Be Over"" ! The editing managed to make the movie as sullen as Carano's face. Now, how they never thought that this was destructively bad ?! No one in the editing room ever felt ""..and what's entertaining in what we're doing ??!!"". Actually, what's worse, in what's supposed to be an action thriller, than looking many times to your watch before half of the movie is finished ?!!

The soundtrack tried to pay a homage to the 1970s blaxploitation movies. But the final outcome was something poor and weak. Another reason to feel the pedantry and ‚Äì yes ‚Äì the bore !

How to evaluate acting while there was no script or characters or drama? What I watched was nothing attractive despite the many attractive names. Frankly all the huge cast was there for doing absolutely nothing. And to add more fuel, the script believed that playing the movie seriously, with no one-liners, or comprehensible lines in the first place, would make you feel ""different"" or ""realistic"". However, all of that eventually succeeded in making you frustrated and mad !

At times, I felt that Haywire is a spy thriller spoof. It is on the verge of being one indeed. Look at the tacky plot, matters like a secret agent who revels all of her secrets to the first boy she meets (!), the totally absurd killings, the too sophisticated events, the never intelligible denouement, and you know what, we can consider the stars' appearances as cameos; like the ones seen in parody movies (I know that I laughed at Bill Paxton, he was in it for couple of the most unnecessary lines in movie history !). But the ugly truth is that even this way, the movie is still uninteresting and wearisome !

So aside from a few cool fights, this is terrible at best. But since having boring lead, boring stars, boring script, boring music, and very boring directing; it works fine as a catalog of ""How to be boring in many ways, if not all the ways"" for all the young filmmakers out there ! Eventually, and with considerable justice, I give (Haywire) 1 out of 10, and this ""1"" goes directly to the girl wearing a bikini in the last scene. Truly, none was as good !

So far, Steven Soderbergh is great my foot !"

Permalink",False,"Well a secret agent wants some revenge for some stuff, and some stuff happens, and there's some fights were some stuff happens with some funky art house jazz playing, and then some other stuff happens and Antonia Banderas does that voice he does, and I sigh. Id like to talk about the story line but I felt so disengaged through out the film all I could wonder was what I had done to deserve this. So we see an all star cast including Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor amongst others who all have betrayed our female protagonist Gina Carano in some way or another. The story is non linear and starts with the second half of the film and jumps around like a kangaroo on cocaine.

The lead Character Mallory has more emotion in her performance than my bed side table, but then again my bedside table is quite useful. From doing my research I see it's her first feature film and her technical ability with the fight scenes were good but I found myself having little sympathy for her character or anybody involved in her universe. It had a solid cast at first glance but like I said they talked about some stuff and did some stuff and more stuff happened, that was it. On the one hand my head rose a little when Michael Douglas appeared on screen but he wasn't there long enough to engage me. I just wanted more and it's not enough to just shove an A list cast in front of an audience, throw some fight sequences in and expect a decent action film.

When it came to the technical side of things I found my self really involved in the fight scenes and felt they were the strongest parts of the film, you felt every punch, but then you also felt the punch of the edit. I felt it was put together really sloppily and when key scenes change from colour to black and white it really pushed you out of the sequence. The jazzy sound track was awful and I felt was trying to give the film a certain level of cool it couldn't achieve.

I was really disappointed with this film, I didn't feel thrilled, nor excited, I just didn't feel anything, It looked like it was going to be promising with a good cast list and high octane action but it just flops with non engaging characters, clunky editing and Bill Paxton. On the plus side the fighting scenes are good, but not good enough to string together an hour and half of a revenge movie."

Permalink",False,"Most January movie releases are simply just studios putting on junk they know is junk to make a quick buck. This January, the big studios have subjected audiences to the horrendous 'The Devil Inside' and the extremely corny 'Red Tails.' Even a semi-decent release like 'Contraband' was easy forgettable.

So when I hear that Steven Soberbergh is making a spy revenge movie with the likes of Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum (who I believe is drastically underrated because of his poor role choices), and Antonio Banderas, I had high hopes. But two thing worried me: the first is, as previously stated, it would be a January release, which didn't make the film seem all that appearing. The second was the fact that a total non-actor would be carrying the film, real life MMA star, Gina Carano.

I won't bother getting much into the plot (see the synopsis on the home page), but I will say that in order to get the full experience and be able to follow along, do NOT take any bathroom breaks or go to refill your popcorn. As an avid movie buff who's seen his fair share of complex plot lines, I was even confused as to who some of the characters were or what there tie in was to the plot, which is one of my few gripes.

But the fighting scenes in this movie were worth the price of admission alone. None of this computer-generated, unrealistic clich√© Hollywood BS. The fights in this, while being incredbily awesome, also possessed a feeling of actual realism, which is very refreshingly this day in age. Soberbergh proves here that he's one of the best working directors in the ways that he does not continuously chop up the edits or add any unnecessary music.

As for Gina Carano, let's just say she can hold her own in a fight sequence. As beautiful as Angelina Jolie and Kate Beckingsale are, when it comes down to them being action stars, it's simply not believable that a woman of such a small stature can take down a 220 pound man. Carano, on the other hand, is completely believable. Not only does she kick plenty of butt (Soderbergh made the movie around her athletic ability), she doesn't look half bad doing it: which is the best combination for any action star.

My biggest problem with the movie itself is Gina Carano's voice, which was 'altered' (let's face it, dubbed) into a voice that almost doesn't sound human. At some moments in the film, it's passable, but at others, it almost sounds like a robot is talking. Why the voice altering happened is up in arms, but it pulled me away from the movie for a few short times.

For a January release, this is all you can ask for and more. Had this come out a month's prior, it could of made my top 10 of 2011, and that's high praise."

The movie is if anything very fun and exciting. And has many subtle cool factors that are simply thoughtfully shot out scenes. It has its own pretty unique direction and angle. While, Kate Beckinsale and Angelina Jolie were hot icons and the image women of action for a while. Gina Carano feels the most organic and plausible.

Not even close, is she terrible, no, for her first feature film she did an amazing job, and the stunts? well they were absolute perfection.

The star studded cast also made this film what it was, but throw in all the fantastic fights most of them do, and this film is a solid well acted flick that everyone will (should) enjoy. As generic as the storyline is, I believe it to be completely different with Carano as the lead, I think her acting made the film ""feel"" different and that added to the uniqueness of the film, but as much as I love her and the film, she needs to work on her acting chops but luckily she can only go up from here.

So with that this is a solid action/spy flick that has a different flavor to it that I believe will add to it success and make Gina a new action star that people will want and continue to see in future movies."

This movie is slow, with very little dialog and the fight scenes were okay, definitely not great. It could have been made into an okay movie if the editing, music or timing were better. It was just slow and awkward. The characters really had no chemistry. In the chase scene, Gina's running was labored. I had trouble believing she was supposed to be a marine.

Permalink",True,"When my friends suggested that we go and see Haywire on 18/1/2012 I was already sceptical enough as it was, I watched the trailer and saw it as a straight up Bourne rip off. In fact if this film had used the same script as the Bourne films and just changed the lead characters names it would have been 100% better. It tries too hard to be clever and stylish, which leads to an intense boredom factor whilst watching. It is painfully obvious that the script has been trimmed right down to the bare bones for Carano in an attempt to stop her from talking as what little script she did have to learn was delivered as dead pan as Channing Tatum is in all of his ""films"".

It had the feel of one big favour, perhaps the producer is a rich man who just fancied a pop at film making, either way it is obvious that this usually talented cast (minus Tatum) were just turning up for the pay day.

Moving into the actual film, it leaps straight into the action, the best scene of the film being the Diner in upstate New York where (**Spoiler Alert**) Channing Tatums Aaron turns up and has what is the best choreographed fight in the film with Carano. **** Unfortunately after this the film lost its grip on me and drifted far into the realms of boredom and cringeworthy acting. There is another thorn in my side after watching this film **(Spoiler Alert)**, we understand that Malorie is being chased by Kenneth after what ""went down"" in Barcelona, this is made very obvious, but what is not ever established is what actually happened in Barcelona, this leaves a huge gaping hole in the already weak story.

Overall the film moves very slowly for an actioner, the lack of speech or enthusing soundtrack almost put me to sleep, and the acting was of the minimal effort. I actually had to pull my phone out halfway through to tweet about my disgust, and I have not had my phone out in the cinema for 6 years.

Permalink",False,"The trailer for Haywire presented itself as a fun action-packed B-movie homage with A-list calibre talent, but what we get is a very bland, boring movie that fails as an action flick and as a thriller and should have been confined to straight-to-DVD hell.

Mallory (Gina Carano) is a former marine and a private contractor for a security company. She is a professional ass-kicker and her skills are in high demand, which leads her to leave her current employer, Kenneth (Ewan McGregor). But on a mission in Dublin she is set up as a murderer and nearly killed. Mallory has to go the run and get revenge against Kenneth and anyone he is working with.

Gina Carano is obviously an accomplished martial artist and the action scenes were very brutal, raw and hard-hitting. She is able to hold her own despite the initial shock of seeing grown men putting a beating on her. There's a nice moment when Carano enters her first fight against Channing Tatum and the music stops and you end up just watching two people having a gritty fight in which anything goes. But the music dropping out during the other fights quickly loses its impact to the point that the final fight is extremely anti-climactic.

Steven Soderbergh is of course a respected director able to make a movie in almost any genre. But he can be very hit and miss at the same time. Haywire goes squarely in the miss category. His direction was very underwhelming. Haywire is slow, poorly paced and the action scenes are too few and far between. Rather than being an action movie it comes off as an uninteresting and very cheap-looking spy flick. The best bits of the movie are in the very misleading trailer. The plot is unremarkable, there is no real intelligence nor any character development whatsoever.

Most of the actors throughout the movie were on autopilot and their performance reflected that, most of them being very boring. After trying to make porn star Sasha Grey into a legitimate actress, Soderbergh tries the same with Carano to no avail. It is clear that Carano is not a trained actress and she lets her fists do the talking. Her character was almost like Lisbeth Salander: cold, distant and clinical. The few times she speaks, her delivery is stiff. Tatum looked and sounded like he was drunk during the movie and McGregor and Michael Douglas were just so dull. Only Michael Fassbender comes out with some credit.

The score by David Holmes is one of the worst and most misjudged I have ever heard. It sounds like a bad jazz album set to a '60s spy series, which doesn't fit the film's tone at all.

Although many see this film as an attempt to ""take back action cinema"" or as a great example of female empowerment and a woman showing her credentials as a action hero, Kill Bill, Hanna and Kick-Ass are much better movies with strong ass-kicking female characters. Don't bother with Haywire.

Permalink",False,"*Spoiler Alert - this film will spoil your day!!*

From beginning to end the film has no beginning or end. Every aspect of this film sucks. It has some heavy weight actors but delivers nothing in the way of anything. The story line is weak, I couldn't even really see one. I withstood the urge to stand up and walk out only to see if it could redeem its self, which it didn't and I would like those painful hours of my life back! Yes painful! Cheesy lines you would only expect from straight to DVD garbage. The blurb says Mallory the main character is beautiful, another load of garbage. Half way through the film she obviously took a trip to the Caribbean and got her hair braided. She is nothing like a female Jason Bourne, at best her performance is 3rd rate. Just don't waste your time and find another film to watch!

Permalink",False,"What a waste of such good actors. This movie never had anything going. Some of the action seems were dragged out and looked fake. The director has directed great movies, so that made it even more saddening.

The music that is played throughout the movie didn't even fit the scenes and was over powering.

I can appreciate the fact they used a real MMA fighter in this but honestly its the same reason most WWE films die before they hit the theatre.

Don't waste your time, wait for it to be free on some late night obsolete cable channel.

Permalink",False,"At the Theater- ""Haywire"" - Gina Carano's feature-film starring role debut is a low-key Drama/Action/Thriller that should prove highly pleasurable to action purists and general movie-goers alike. Those who appreciate quality, believable mixed martial arts fight scenes that are choreographed, staged and filmed in a way that allows a viewer to take it all in should find quite a bit here to enjoy. Carano has presence and ability to spare- not to mention she's as sexy as the night is long!

Carano's surprisingly good as far as her acting abilities are concerned- in her film career infancy, she's light-years ahead of the vast majority of marquee action stars that have come and gone before her. Director Steven Soderbergh (Out Of Sight, The Limey, Contagion) apparently pulled quite a bit of subtle facial expressions out of her with excellent effect. Her agility here is what most will be impressed with- stunt women will find it difficult to get work in her films. Furthermore, this might spell the end of seeing the likes of Angelina Jolie, Kate Beckinsale and Milla Jovavich in action-heroine roles... you know, because of a ""believability"" issue...

A rather impressive cast includes; Michael Douglas (great to see him healthy), Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Bill Paxton and Channing Tatum- all in what amounts to extended cameos, though they're all very much worthwhile.

Highly Recommended in theaters- this might be the only action film of the year that men and women can equally enjoy. Loved the ending! Rated R. 9.0 out of 10"

Permalink",False,"Saw this the other day at the cinema and enjoyed it. As far a action heroine's go, Gina Carano will come far I'm sure. The plot's your usual story of betrayal and revenge but done stylishly courtesy of Steven Soderbergh. It was good to see some old school actors in it as well from the likes of Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor and Michael Fassbender. Good support from Channing Tatum and Antonio Banderas as well. The action, when it comes, is thick and fast. Some of the best fights I've seen on film. Violent, intricate and detailed. And the fact it's a tick girl who's ironing everyone out is a bonus. It's a bit short and takes a bit to get going but overall a good job from all and something completely different from what Soderbergh's done before. And I liked it.

Permalink",True,"Its nice to see a woman in a lead role of a action movie. ""Haywire,"" starring Gina Carano, Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas and Michael Fassbender provides this very look that is quite nice.

This movie is about a secret agent that does missions that the normal government want to part of. She stumbles across a situation were her branch betrays her and she is forced to do what she has to do.

First off I want to say the fight scenes were on point! I like when you have fight scenes in a movie and you can see everything that is happening. At times, movies tend to make the fight scenes too fast and its hard to tell what is going on. That doesn't happen in this movie. There were enough fight scenes for this movie but a few more wouldn't have hurt.

There were times were the movie got a little dull. The plot is descent but there might have been a little too much talking involved...as far as getting a rap on the specific points of the plot. I thought Gina Carano(Mallory) does a great job in this movie too bad this movie is doesn't get a higher rating from me. I just have a gut feeling that this movie could have been better. I'm going to give this movie a 7 out of 10.

This isn't a bad movie to watch, but you can wait for this to come out on Netflixs or Redbox. I would definitely say its worth looking at once before you pass.

Permalink",False,"Once a mold is created for a certain genre of film, it can be hard to make anything to rattle the cages again. Anything stepping past that invisible line is referred to as ""not really a horror movie"" (even though it is), ""not quite a sci-fi film"" (except that it was), or ""a film that defies genre"" (which likely means it is just a good film firing on all cylinders). The challenge here is how we as an audience react to a film that dares to peek outside our tiny genre box; every so often we need to just stretch our fingers over the lip of the box to feel for something more. In Haywire, we get our newest example of stretching those boundaries to see what happens when you try to film something ""more than just an action movie.""

Haywire is the tension-filled tale of Mallory, a soldier for hire under a private contractor. She is sent on an assignment that goes south fast. Dodging enemies and former colleagues from all sides, she has to find out who burned her and why.

The first thing pulling Haywire out of the box is its director, Steven Soderbergh. Well known for his award-winning films, Traffic and Erin Brokovich, he also found huge success with his rat pack team of A-list actors in the Oceans series. With the dollars he made in the big budget world, he also found time to keep his imagination on its toes with experimental films like Bubble and The Girlfriend Experience. In that last film, Soderbergh tried out a formula, which he continued in Haywire, filling your lead role with someone outside the acting world, someone who actually lives much closer to the part in real life. In Girlfriend, he hired porn star Sasha Grey as the emotionally complicated high-priced escort. In Haywire, he filled the role of ex-marine Mallory with MMA fighter Gina Carano. Obviously this tactic does not always work (just look at 99% of the movies WWE Studios puts out), but when you have an eye for quality and depth like Soderbergh's, your rate of success is bound to be higher.

Carano is straight street toughness all the way from the first moment we see her on screen to the final intense stare in her eyes. Her real life fighting abilities helped Soderbergh craft a much deeper sense of realism in the action movie violence. No double twisting backflip kicks, no catching swinging sword blade between the palms of your hands, just straight up hand- to-hand, gun-toting reality. He even pulled down the sound effects that we are used to with muted gunshots and thick sounding punches. All of those choices brought together helped you look at the action on screen and say, ""Yep, she could totally do that (and likely kick my ass to boot)."" He also surrounded her with talented help, like Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton and the recently unstoppable Michael Fassbender (seriously, how many movies has this guy had waiting to come out at the same time?). Even Channing Tatum comes in to give her a reasonable love interest for a moment, a guy who might be able to go toe-to-toe with her in a fight.

While the movie succeeds in the action and tension department, it also falls a little flat in an area not uncommon to Soderbergh films: it just stops. The story plays nicely with the subtlety of the situation Carano finds herself in, but takes so much time showing all the intricacies that it fails to feel completely wrapped up when it goes to black. Making it even worse is the movie clocks in around ninety minutes, meaning there really was plenty of time to give this a more well-rounded ending."

Permalink",True,"This is one of the worst and most painful movie-watching experiences I've ever had to endure. I tried watching this movie last night but to no avail... I had to get up and leave the movie theater. An absolute fiasco! I have no idea what Ewan McGregor and Michael Douglas were thinking when they accepted to be a part of this absolute disaster. The choice of music, the colors, the dialogues, they're all off. It's hard to imagine a movie in which every choice made was wrong. The fight scenes look like a bad series of Mexican wrestling bouts; I hadn't seen anything so fake in a very long time. Halfway into the movie, it got a little hard to follow the dialogues for people were either laughing or snoring. It's only happened to me twice that I've had to get up and leave a movie theater with an awful taste in my mouth and before the movie ends, Haywire is the second culprit.

Permalink",False,"Many directors attack each screenplay with there own style, actors, score, or other certain signatures. You can tell who is the director just by watching the movie, not the credits. Tarantino, the Coen Brothers, Nolan, Fincher, Eastwood and a select few others have this gift. There are other directors who simply see a great script and know how to adapt it to film better than anyone else can. Spielberg, Jackson and Hooper come to mind. One director comes to mind for myself when it comes to adapting each screenplay as it was written while having a style that is unmistakable. Steven Soderberg. Soderberg has made his mark with very stylistic camera-work, non linear storytelling, and a great score. He has directed straight forward movies telling a story like Erin Brokavich. He has made great time lapsing and non linear movies like Out of Sight starring George Clooney. He has made movies with an elaborate cast and elaborate story telling in the heist Oceans trilogy. He has made his mark receiving multiple Academy Awards for his vast character point of view style movie Traffic. Soderberg really showed the audience his great ear when he directed the underrated Sci-Fi/Drama/Romance? movie Solaris that has a deeply rooted score that becomes almost another character. Contagion is a great realistic disaster with virus movie that combines a vast character base with multiple view points and stylistic camerwork with an unbelievable original score (sure to be ignored by the Academy come award time). All of those movies with different styles resulting from him staying true to the script and still his individuality shines through in such a beautiful way. It seems after all of his achievements he is taking his film making to another level. His most recent movie, Haywire, achieves all of those things that has served him so well and more. A great central character. Just like he had introduced Jennifer Lopez to cinema in 1998 in the fantastic Out of Sight, he introduces a new female lead. MMA star Gina Carano, playing Mallory. Soderberg wraps his stylistic fimmaking and great script around this new star and she is perfect. Without giving away any important details, twists, or turns(and there are plenty) the storyline is fairly basic in essence. A classic agent that has been double crossed and trying to prove her innocence and maybe get a little revenge while she is at it,told through the eyes of Steven Soderberg making the movie clearly unique from the normal model. The movie begins and the story is told from Mallory's point of view telling a young man named Scott (Michael Angarano) whose car she has taken with him still in it. Through this way of storytelling we see her past, her present, and then we catch up to her in the car and see how the rest plays out. Like I said, Soderberg likes his use of non linear time. Carano hold her own acting alongside the likes of Micheal Fassbender, Ewan Macgreggor, Antonio Banderas, Micheal Douglas, Bill Paxton,and more. Pursuing an acting career and having to begin with the likes of these legends and shining through is an impressive feat for Carano to say the least. There are movies with strong female leads but there is an afterthought that they were trying so hard to make the female believably tough. They were making an incredibly sexy and tough lead. Haywire creates Mallory and we see her as a person. We can tell when out of her element she is very nice. When she must fight or kill she is doing it to stay alive, and she isn't killing senselessly like many movies. She doesn't enjoy killing and you can tell thanks to the creation of such a deep character and great performance. Carano is vulnerable and tough and it is makes her incredibly sexy, not simply because she is beautiful. Carano keeps her cool in the viscously tense scenes where someone is simply walking after her. There are follow scenes, chase scenes, escape scenes, and car chases all bringing the audience to the edge of their seat. Each scene made more possible with the highly capable now proved acting chops of Gina Carano as Mallory. This movie does not feel like a movie made for a strong female lead. It feels like an action movie that happens to have a woman for a lead character. The action scenes usually come out of nowhere. They are not jumpy, but unexpected and done beautifully. The scenes are fast paced, long, and most importantly, believable. They are perfectly choreographed which I am sure was easier to do with an MMA star as your tool but still. This gave the film makers a chance to go over the top with it and they made the fighting intense, brutal, and creative while keeping it in reason. Her fighting style was obviously flawless but the audience never gets a sense that there watching a UFC fight. It's also the first movie I have seen where getting knocked out in a tightly gripped leglock seems like a great way to end a night. Haywire has a great cast, a great script, a great breakout lead and a great director doing some of his finest work. I myself am excited to see more Gina Carano in the future even if the movie is the Percy Jackson sequel. To see more reviews rollginreviews@blogspot.com"

Permalink",True,"So my mom wanted to see Red Tails, but I just had to say ""no, Haywire looks good!"" I was wrong. The acting was whatever. Not bad, but not anything special. The female lead was not my favorite, but I see that she is not even a professional actress, so I'll let that slide.

The scenes, the ones where nothing is happening, were dead long. Not enough enticing dialogue. The fighting was really good and interesting, but once I knew how the movie was going, I didn't expect anything exciting to come after any of the fighting.

The plot, the storyline, everything was bad, messy. There was no point or purpose. The plot was utterly dull and simple. Someone should have RE-edited this movie. That ending....O god.

The part I liked was when the lead runs up on ""Kenneth"" on the beach. The camera work brought some intensity, which I liked. I liked the odd and complicated angles... but that's pretty much it. There was no suspense. No holding of the breath. No excitement. I wasn't holding on the edge of my seat, I was slumping back lazily.

When we left the theater everyone behind us were shaking their heads; we also heard some side remarks about how bad the movie was once we got outside.

Do not, I repeat do not, waste your money... Several times I was thinking about walking out the theater. I was so very bored and uninterested; I'm still upset that I wasted an 1 1/2 of just sitting there displeased and bored. I really wanted Haywire to be good. I thought there was going to be action, some adrenaline, chaos.. And even if were meant to be a more subtle action movie, it still didn't capture me whatsoever.

Permalink",True,"I hadn't heard of this before becoming bored one night at work, but I've been left feeling glad I found it. It starts and your left a little at a loss, to begin with, because there's none of the Hollywood bloat or cinematic devices to detract or guide you. Instead you're left looking to Flick's character for answers, which is very clever. As you move through the story you begin to build around her character and piece things together. Refreshing devoid of clich√© or lazy direction, it had a good pace and some well judged comedy from the poor lad who gets swept up with Mallory. I especially loved the music, had me thinking of 70's spy thrillers, very welcome. And there was no constant soundtrack, like when she's exciting the Hotel, you are on the street with her, immersed in the soundscape and drawn into the tension. Overall I'm delighted with this movie. It's cast seem to be there for the story, not their careers, although I'm sure it didn't hurt. Flick is brilliant and I'd love to see her in more. A wonderful tonic to wash away the bad taste of Hollywood 'junk food' movies.

Permalink",False,"First of all I think putting the UFC fighter Gina in the movie was a cool idea, and the action scenes were pretty awesome. Her acting was pretty bad, and the rest of the actors didn't do much to save it. Overall the movie was good because of the great action scenes as I said before, but I wouldn't really recommend it. Unless you are a UFC fan, or a Gina fan, and you would like to see some MMA in a movie, then I'd pass on this film.

I read a different review below, and I must agree that the fight scenes looked real, and watching the special features... (yes I spent the time) being stuck in a hotel room will do this to ya lol. any whom, she obviously is an MMA fighter so she did her own stunts, but in the fight scene in the bed room the male actor actually put on cushions, and took the blows... they say Gina was not at 100% but I'm sure she still gave him a few good blows. I love that about movies, when you work that hard at making it look real. I hate CGI... I love the matrix, and can't stand the fight scenes in the follow up movies, cause of the damn CJI

Permalink",False,"The trailer told me to expect an explosive action thriller - A female black ops soldier/ assassin working for a private contractor is sold out by her employers and is hunted by the very people she served, leading to Jason Bournesque action sequences and a brisk, high paced plot... With a cast of Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas and Michael Fassbender, I had every reason to expect a solid action movie.

The lead is played by Gina Carano - someone I had never heard of before, but that's OK. She looked the part of a highly trained soldier, and fit the role perfectly.

But the film came up way below expectations - It was an OK plot, but nothing to write home about. There were some spurts of action which were done well. But the story was paaaaainfully slow. I kept chanting 'It's gonna pick up soon' over and over, but it just never really did. It's an OK watch if you have patience and time... But you have better options out there.

Ooh, you get the soundtrack that comes over the end credits - Very lovely piece by music director David Holmes - That was really engrossing."

Permalink",False,"FINALLY, a flick about a female Jason Bourne. Carano is attractive and ruthless in one go, and she's captivating to watch as she wallops all those who stand in her way in this study of female revenge.

The movie is partially told in flashbacks and I, for one, loved watching her go through the motions.

However, it's quite monotonous in its theme, in that violence is the panacea for all problems.

Michael Douglas has a small character as an agent who manages Carano. He keeps his above the mess. Tatum plays Carano's love interest. But his character gets knocked off quickly.

Permalink",False,"The movie had a great cast but seemed to labor a bit. I think what disturbed me the most was the dialogue was a bit slow and you could almost feel the director directing. I was hoping it would move a little smoother. Some of the scenes seemed to come out of nowhere and made me think, 'how does that fit in with what's going on?' I just completed my first book and discovered how difficult it can be to get it to flow but, at the same time, keep the reader enrapt. And also to make sure the climax comes at the perfect moment. I suppose directing a movie has the same challenges as the director and actors work off each other. All in all, the plot was good and she certainly can kick some butt. I would like to see her in future movies.

It seems like, somebody made a action movie, just for the fun of it - without thinking it through. And what is it with Malory's voice? Her face and body work does a OK decent job acting, but the voice... It's not enough to let a pretty woman who can put up a fight, lead. She has to be believable and with a lame plot to go with her, it just not worth anybodies time. I was truly looking forward to see this movie...but must admit i considered not to watch it to the end.

Okay, so the plot may be cliche the bad guys characters a bit flat, the story a bit predictable, but let's face it, you're not going to find many truly original films in this genre anyway. Why did I like it? Gina Carano is absolutely crucial here and I can imagine if any other actress was cast in her place, this movie would bomb hard. And that's the selling point, she makes the scenes actually believable, which is super rare in action films, it doesn't feel like a cartoon it feels realistic. I can honestly say it's worth watching.

Permalink",False,"Haywire

Haywire is a plot driven action thriller about a spy who seeks revenge after a mission goes down and is hunted down by her fellow companions.

The choreography of all the action sequences are jaw dropping that is lethally performed which leaves the audience in an awe of it. The crisp of the feature isn't kept alive through pummeling their way out of the track, but the thrilling ride it offers in that limited span. Chess like slick moves, characteristics of the characters and scoreboard mentality game is what keeps these characters not only intriguing and mysterious but pragmatic.

As always, Soderbergh's pace is eerie, but he surely knows when to chew things and take it slowly and when to fasten and narrow it into one big punch. The background score can be daft at certain moments but is finely edited with decent cinematography and sharp sound effects.

The chase sequences are smarter than we usually get and so are tricks and treats that is constantly imputed in each aspects of it, to keep the audience tangled in its cruel cold bubble. At a certain point somewhere in its middle act, there aren't any verbal content and is purely relied upon the detailed physical screenplay. As the script enfolds, it gets juicier than ever and with Soderbergh behind the camera, it is definitely not short on execution.

Carano at the heart of it, may not be the anticipated actress, but surely delivers eye popping physical sequences that one has not yet encountered and the guest actors like Douglas, McGregor, Tatum, Banderas and Fassbender holds on to their part tightly. Neat and clean visuals, live locations and gut wrenching sturdy action sequences are the high points of the feature.

Haywire is not a game changer but definitely redefines the genre by offering some real concrete material to the audience that is horrendous for its gritty practical approach."

Permalink",False,"This movie is one of the biggest surprises. I was interested it as soon as it was made public that Gina Carano would star in it. I have been a Carano fans since her days in StrikeForce and wanted to see if she can make a successful transition to the movies, and not fall flat like so many other martial artists before her. Although I knew Soderbergh directed this one, I didn't think much of it, was simply hoping for a spy thriller with decent martial arts action. And then I read the reviews and saw the somewhat low rating and didn't really give it a shot.

So 6 years have passed and I finally got to watching it, and boy, was I wrong to initially dismiss it. It might not have been in the vein as the Bourne movies, James Bond or almost any modern spy- covert ops movie, but the difference between most of those and Haywire is that Haywire looks stunningly authentic. The action scenes, especially the close quarters hand-to-hand combat is phenomenal. I knew Gina was chosen because of her MMA prowess, but she exceeds every expectation. All fight scenes are beautifully choreographed and make for an exciting experience. The other actors have done no less and tried to do as good as Gina, and it's visible.

I fully enjoyed how Soderbergh presents a great number of longs shots without any background music, only small clicks and sounds straight from the environment, which further hypes the situation. I don't think I have ever seen a movie like this, that tries to create an atmosphere without bombastic music and sound effects, instead it just lets you watch the action and immerses you into it with great camera work, great storytelling and wonderful pacing. Watching this makes you present in the whole endeavor and the struggles of the protagonist. It seems shockingly authentic the entire time, which makes it really fascinating.

I would recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy a good movie, with a good premise and very stylized execution. I wasn't really aware this was a Soderbergh movie until the second long shot. His directing is really appropriate for this kind of movie. The supporting cast consists of Hollywood A-listers who can act and fight, which is a short list, but one that shines throughout the movie. Definitely worth a watch or two."

Permalink",False,"I really liked this movie. The story is very straightforward. Carano plays a hired operative who gets double crossed and has to find out how and why. Simple. It reminds me of Soderbergh's Oceans 11 in that it is well paced, well shot, and not over the top. Other reviewers compared it to Salt and the Bourne series. That's a huge misrepresentation. Those movies are over the top yawn fests. This movie has better dialogue, a better soundtrack, and a great supporting cast, including Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, and Evan Macgregor. Carano holds her own and fits the part perfectly. Yes, she kicks a lot of ass, but she doesn't seem invincible. More determined, like Liam Neeson from the first Taken film. At a brisk 1:30 hours this film never overstays its welcome. It never tries to do too much - no giant explosions or lengthy car chases, and no overindulgent quick-edits. Soderbergh keeps it simple and that's the beauty of this movie.

Watch her 2014 film.. 'In The Blood'.. then you'll get a much better look at her true overall talent. There are several other female action-actors.. she has the unique skills to pull it off looking totally like it's for real.. not an act. Others not so naturally skilled, and having 'to learn' how it's done are at an extreme disadvantage. I for one will follow any of her future work.. she can without a doubt put on a great show.

Permalink",False,"I get why the studio was nervous to release this film: too artsy and slower paced with an unknown in the lead. I can also tell why audiences will be divided: female action leads tend to be a tough sell. People expecting balls to the wall action, with explosions and bullet fire every five seconds will have to look elsewhere. What we get is an arty action movie with some of the best filmed action I have seen. I rather enjoyed the story about a female operative being betrayed by her organization. Its been done before, but never so expertly here. The only thing I frowned on was that Gina's voice in the film sounds altered. I saw her in interviews for the film, and wish they would have kept her natural voice. She shines in this role, and easily is the best contender for the lead if DC ever gets off their laurels and makes a wonder woman film. Bottom line, very watchable action flick, with decent acting ( in an action movie? No way!!) amazing action and a stylized film style. Plus, my best friend and I couldn't help but grooving to the 60's spy style music of the film. Great way to spend an afternoon!!

Permalink",False,"I am always a fan of a movie with a strong female lead, so with the film Haywire I kept an open mind and hoped for the best. I was not at all disappointed in this movie. I was a bit dismayed that the trailer gave away so much, so that going in I knew exactly what the story was about and how some of the relationships would unfold. Specifically, when the physical altercation between Mallory (Gina Carano) and Paul (Michael Fassbender) took place there was little surprise in how it would end. I would have re-titled Haywire to 'Man Trouble', although in all the situations that Mallory became enthralled in, she handled herself extremely well. Not that I have anything against tiny little petite model types, but there is a level of credibility that came to the role of Mallory because of Ms. Carano's physique. I truly believed that she was able to feed any nemesis whatever came out of that can of whip-ass once she opened it up. The thing that I found intriguing about the hand to hand combat scenes, and in my opinion enhanced the authenticity of the bouts, was that they were sans a blaring soundtrack that would convince the audience that the scenes were exciting. The scenes were exciting! The removal of the soundtrack during those scenes was an added little treat, since there was no fast paced droning noise to distract from what was actually taking place on screen. This film hosted some heavy hitters in the supporting cast category who gave as always admirable performances, and I appreciated the fact that it was not immediately obvious which side of the coin the characters Coblenz (Michael Douglas) or Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas) were on, I couldn't tell until the story wrapped if they were good guys or bad. It was very obvious which side Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) was playing (again that pesky trailer), but it was still a solid acting job from Mr. McGregor and the aforementioned Mr. Fassbender both did a good job at being convincing in their roles. I have to say that although I have nothing against Channing Tatum (Aaron) his performances as always are somewhat consistent with overcooked beef very, very, dry and hard to swallow. I liked his performance best when he was a hip-hop dancer toying with ballet. The cities Barcelona, Dublin and San Diego are probably rarely linked and have little in relation outside the context of this film, nevertheless this story brought them all together nicely. I enjoyed this movie and give it a green light."

Gina is a ""real"" version of the action heroines that Angelina Jolie plays very often - the fight scenes were excellent; really gritty and seemed realistic to me. I heard that Michael Fassbender got injured during one of his scenes when the adrenaline got a little too high.

The uses of music during the action scenes worked really well - much better than in other films I have seen (the music in Mission Impossible 4 recently was so bad it distracted me from the film). It loses its way a little towards the end but overall very entertaining.

Well worth a view - the guy who posted such a negative view must have been watching another movie?!

It had all the ingredients for a fun action, thriller with a dash of A List acting, but the simple plot was confusingly told, the fights were either stagey or overly brutal and throughout there was no drama, or pace, or excitement, or much of anything positive really and all set to the over the top 70s cop show soundtrack.

When is Steven Soderbergh retiring? If only it had been one film ago!

The hour longer J Edgar I saw this week actually felt shorter last night.

The blame doesn't lie with Gina Carano she is OK in the main role, but the A-List acting cast is wasted and not once does Soderbergh create any tension, excitement or drama in this so called 'action' movie.

I honestly can't explain the positive reviews unless they are all PR plants."

Permalink",True,"Haywire

I walked into this movie fairly cold. I saw the trailer, but those can be hit or miss. I am not a huge fan of Mr. Soderbergh, but I love Oceans 11, so I figured I would give it a try. In my mind I likened this movie to the Bourne Identity. Both movies are about spies, have a heavy martial arts theme, and feature a protagonist who (according to the trailer) is on the run.

From the get go this movie says ""I'm different"". Gina and Channing go at it in a no-holds-bard fight in a diner that starts and ends brutal. From there it goes at a nice pace of revealing small amounts of plot and giving us amazing fight scenes.

Some reviews have accused Gina of being an amateur. I think they just don't like her since she is a woman and a MMA fighter. Hollywood is progressive as long as women are porn stars and bleach blonde. As soon as they look like real women, or don't fit the mold of helpless damsels, that's where Hollywood's so-called progressives stop.

Haywire is a tight, thrilling action romp that gives us a action heroine we have needed for a long time. A ass kicking woman, emphasis on the woman. She isn't a stick figure pretending to throw punches, she is throwing them. She doesn't hold guns like they are going to bight her; she holds them like she has been using them all her life.

Gina, if you read this, and my words mean everything, I will see every movie you are ever in for the rest of my life, as far as I am concerned, you are the greatest female action star of our day.

Permalink",False,"I'm no fan of MMA. I recently tried to get into the spirit of a couple of the fights and gave it a fair shake but it just isn't for me I think. That said whenever I heard about this project I was interested; Steven Soderbergh making a thriller using a MMA fighter instead of an actress? There must be a reason for that I figured, and indeed all the interviews I read talked about how he had found Carano to be a great presence and to have this skill set that was a boon to the film. What happened between those ideas and the final cut of the film I'm not sure because the end product here is surprisingly low in action and actually pretty dull.

We'll start with the plot, such as it is. Mallory finds herself seeking revenge for a double-cross on a job in Barcelona ‚Äì a double-cross we learn about during flash-backs across the first half of the film. It sort of has a flow to it but it never totally makes sense, although to be honest, I never totally cared for it to do so since the plot was a thin device to create motion ‚Äì and it is the motion we have all come here for. The action is brutal and violent and, although some of the moves are not particularly cinematic, the fight sequences are reasonably satisfying mainly due to the impact that most of the blows have. The problem is that they are as short as they are brutal and the choreography lacks flair and style ‚Äì the action is functional rather than flashy. This means that the thrills that normally come from a mix of plot and action to produce urgency just aren't there and as a result the thing feels pretty dull for the most part.

Carano is a big part of this. Yes she is very physical and has MMA skills I'm sure, but delivering lines is stiff at best and she seems to have very little presence in front of camera. If you think that Steven Seagal is limited in his delivery, Carano may give you a new appreciation for him. It doesn't help that the film surrounds her with people who act for a living ‚Äì and not only that but many of them are big names who have easy screen presence; Douglas, Banderas, McGregor, Fassbender and others all drift round the edges doing solid work but hurting the ""star"" by virtue of their presence.

I had hoped that Haywire would deliver some good basic action sequences with maybe a twist from the director, but unfortunately this is very workmanlike stuff. The fights are brutal but short and there are too few of them and the nature and structure of the plotting doesn't really allow for flow or urgency in the telling. The end result is a film that is remarkable only for how unremarkable and dull it is."

Permalink",False,"I saw this years ago and could not find anything useful to say about it. I saw it again because I am trying to understand what Soderbergh is doing with his life. He worries me because I have invested part of *my* life to films he has made. I know him to be capable of following deep subterranean channels.

This film was apparently something he worked hard to put together. That's precious energy from a man who alternates between silly-work-for-money and art.

The Limey is a favored film because of the way he works with the edits: inside the mind of the assassin, things overlap, are anticipated and evaluated. It is a simple story as here, stereotypical but executed with visual risk. Why not something like that here, instead of mainstream technique? Is it because he couldn't imagine a woman's aggressive vision?

You can almost see Soderbergh setting this up to be an ambitious experiment. Otherwise, why recruit McGregor? Why start the filming with the motel room tussle and death? My theory is that Soderbergh thought to build a film like The Limey but using a woman's eye, and including in that eye the knowledge that everyone she kills is someone she has slept with.

Weeks into this, with reshoots of the hotel room fight and different approaches to how brutal, how sexy, how desperate¬Ö and I think he decided that it was unreachable. And we end up with an ordinary TeeVee level chase movie.

Do we credit the ambition? Do we imagine the film that could have been made? Do we take this director seriously when he gives up time and again?"

Permalink",False,"Okay, so the main 2 reasons I saw this movie was to see Gina Carano who is a real MMA fighter kick butt and because of Michael Fassbender. Now the fight sequences was alright but what really stands out about it, is the rawness of it all. It seems a bit exaggerated when it comes to the guys fighting but the fight sequences looked real when it came to Gina Carano. Michael Fassbender isn't in this much and didn't stand out as much as I expected. For a bit of a B action movie it has a roster of actors that has a name in the movie business. The plot however was dull and has nothing new going for it, it's just unoriginal and the execution for the most part is pretty darn boring. The cover has Gina Carano duel wielding guns but that is a fake marketing, since it has her doing more hand to hand fights than gun fights. Which can be a positive to some audience and negative to others. I first thought this would be a straight forward and narrow action movie with a lot of explosions. But it turns out to be a simple story told in a complicated way, which isn't a good thing. Simple and effective is good but that just isn't the case for this one. And the movie doesn't depend on explosions but actually tries to go in a story direction which is pretty flat. Not saying explosions make a action movie or anything like that, but the action just seemed a bit dull in some areas. I am not sure if the director wanted to make a female Jason Bourne style movie but it lacks in many areas if that was the idea. There is only one thing memorable about this movie is how the fight scenes doesn't seem choreographed and looks real when it comes to Gina Carano. It just wasn't that entertaining or thrilling.

Permalink",False,"A solid and well made thriller indeed. No matter that in the end you don't arrive at knowing who works for whom and for what or against whom or what and who betrays whom and for what. But nothing is misrepresented or faked. You simply are not told explicitly about it that's all. But what is important in this movie is that technically and formally it's one of the best of this kind with constant action and chases and superb hand-to-hand struggles and a fabulous performance of Gina Carano in her role of special (?) agent. The end is inconclusive but never mind since the images will fulfill your taste for thrill entirely despite also a few of the usual improbable episodes of the action.

Permalink",False,"With this huge cast I was very surprised that I had not heard of this movie, just rented it from Red Box and finished watching it and I could not believe how poorly this movie was done. I am honestly not sure exactly where it missed out the most: Acting (yes even the big's where a let down). Directing, producing, sound, editing, cinematography, lighting....you name it and it came up short. The story line was pretty solid very Born esq. so it could have been great maybe if a John Woo was behind it or somebody of that stature but this won really sucked... I mean I have scene many worse movies but not with this solid of a cast. What happened? Did they run out of money because they paid for this cast? Because of this cast did they have to short the film from editing? Maybe the couldn't afford a real director or producer so instead they hired a college kid and his buddies because they blew there wad on the actors that didn't show up for this movie until they at least consumed there share of free booze on set during filming. Either way, I cannot figure out how or why this movie blows, good story line great cast...very shocked...feel free to spend the $1.25 at a Red Box near you and be as surprised as I was."

Permalink",False,"Went to see this film as love action films, especially with female leads, and because it had some big names in it (can't be that bad, right?). It was a complete mess. First of all it's not really an action film, more trying to be some sort of smart spy thriller. The problem with that though is it wasn't smart, thrilling, nor had an intriguing twisting plot.

The lead actress can't act, which would be fine if the film was just a straight up action story. She seems to be able to fight. But as she only fights a few times, most of the time we just see her terrible acting. The fact she's with some decent actors as well only highlights this. Everyone else seems to be uncomfortable and just thinking 'Why am I in this?'

The pacing is terrible. It's slow, drags and is basically boring. There's no real story, no atmosphere. The music is terribly out of place and extremely annoying. The fight scenes are basically silent which though is meant to make it more real, just seems weird most of the time.

Don't bother wasting any money going to see this."

As said before 'Bourne Series meets Lara' type phrases describe this aptly. Gina looked like a guy ! Everyone cannot be Lady Croft ! Background music was out of the track. Never got where from the tinkling sound of cell phones came from (I always looked at the person sitting beside me, as if his phone was ringing) and there was some awkward drums beating in the background. Movie ended somewhat unexpectedly. There is actually nothing outstanding to be said about the movie. I really wished the action sequences would worth a watch but alas they weren't. I wish somebody could post some nice things about the movie. Anyways my first movie premiere, overall a nice experience with friends.

Permalink",False,"I am going to go through some points where i feel the movie was severely lacking. Obvious spoilers will follow.

PLOT: The story here is as basic as can be, but told very poorly. After a confrontation with a former lover/colleague, our protagonist basically kidnaps a teenager along with his car. In this car she tells him about her story. Why? No real reason. The way she tells it is overly convoluted and messy, with scenes that easily could have been left out or turned into something more interesting. A previous mission required her to free a hostage, she thinks, and we get to see what happened. The scenes that follow are done without sound effects and the CHEESIEST SOUNDTRACK KNOWN TO MAN. I felt like I was in a low budget 70s cop drama. This long scene was torture. When the action finally started, it was fine. And I really expected it to be more than fine. This girl is no actor. But I knew she was a fighter, so I had high expectations. She somewhat delivered. The real enemy of her fights in this movie are the sound design. But we'll get to that.

After this, she slowly figures out that she has been doublecrossed and that the man she rescued was killed and blah blah blah blah. The thing is, you won't care about ANY of the following ""revelations"". None of them matter, because you couldn't give two poops about these characters. The girl is strangely unlikable in that she always wears her cool, tough, slightly lesbian face on. She has a few ""witty"" remarks and thats about it. We have very little background info to go on, and what little we have is not interesting the least. The same goes for every single person in the movie. The most likable ones are probably the collage kid and Michael Douglas, and we see them for a total of approximately 5 minutes.

Mr.Director: If you want us to root for someone, give us a reason. If you want us to hate someone, show us them being terrible. There is even a scene in the movie where the bad guy has her father at gunpoint, but there is no attempt at taking him hostage, shooting his kneecaps to lure her out, nothing. In the previous scene, she talks with her father and tells him what to say to the bad guys when they arrive. Then she hides herself...only to let them know she is there after 5 minutes. So did she leave loads of violent traps for them to walk in? Terrorize them with her vast knowledge of the house's nooks and crannies? Hang upside down and whisper ""I'M BATMAN"" in their ear? No. She just punches dudes room to room until the bad guy (the one with her dad at gunpoint) just leaves. She finds him at the beach and punches him. It's the dullest climax I have ever seen.

Anyway.

SOUND: What the hell happened to the sound in this movie? I really got worried after the first fightscene. It sounded like it was recorded in a swimmingpool. Even the sound of the pistol going off was like a burp you kill in your throat. Btw, how great was it that she received a cup of hot coffee in her face and looked perfectly fine afterwards? But the worst, by far, is the music. The music will usually kick in the running scenes, and in scenes that are so boring that the director tries to make them ""artsy"". I already mentioned the chase-scene with the 70s copshow music. How about slow running on top of buildings to 70s copshow music? I swear they got this music from porn. I'd rather watch porn than this to be honest. But you know what places that SHOULD have music? Fight scenes. Here, every fight scene is mute. Oh, except for the terrible sound effects of course. I know what they were attempting too. To give the action some credibility by shooting it ""raw"" with just the sound of breaking glass etc. Well, that would be awesome if 1: if sounded like a war, and 2: if we gave two poops about who's face was being bashed in.

To put it short: This movie gave me nothing of interest. No interesting personalities, no truly awesome fights, no exciting story, no music setting the mood, no food for thought, and absolutely no reason to ever see this directors work ever again. If you cast a real fighter in your action movie, you better have it be about loads of action and fighting, not 30 seconds of punching and slowly climbing around rooftops. Give me Ong-Bak, Oldboy, Drive, A history of violence, No country for old men or Taken instead. Those movies all know what they are."

Permalink",True,"I liked this flick. There are a few things wrong with it, like the director's pacing of the film. If he would have focused on the ""Marine dad, turned author, and daughter also a former marine thrust into the CIA and Bourne"" stuff, this would have been a better movie. It seems they try too hard to setup the espionage that they forgot to flesh out the characters.

The action scenes are rock solid, if not a bit short. Each fight scene was around 2 minutes, Kick, Punch, Done. I loved the escape scene on the rooftops. If they had added more parkour to this particular scene, it would have been much better.

Gina Carano proves she can act, and can certainly kick butt. She portrayed a former marine who does clandestine stuff pretty well. My major problem with this particular movie was that they kinda glossed over the character development with more mundane things so much that I was just waiting for the next fight. The pacing was horrible.

Fights in the movie were awesome! There wasn't really loud unrealistic sound effects, no shaky cameras, not a lot of wire work, and not a million cuts.

Permalink",True,"A year after Steven Soderbergh directed a searing drama about people dropping dead from a horrible virus, someone must have told him to take a vacation ‚Äì and here it is: a bombastic ""paid holiday"" for rogue government agent Mallory, both the hunted and the hunter while various co-agents, including Michael Fassbender and Channing Tatum, attempt punching her lights out.

Nice try, fellas.

In the lead role, Gina Carano, delivering lines in a constant monotone and not always adding the right amount of glib charm essential for endearing action/espionage stars, does kick ass with genuine style and velocity.

A retro soundtrack, as if Quentin Tarantino wound up directing a James Bond film, keeps the pace steady and lean. And while Soderbuergh rolls the camera a bit too long during scenes where Mallory ambles from one dangerous setting to the next, it's somewhat reminiscent of flicks like BULLITT where downtime serves a necessary platform for each action sequence: which are plentiful.

And on the peripheral... Bill Paxton as her novelist father, Antonio Banderas as a cautious connection, and Michael Douglas as the Washington D.C. insider provide essential yet filler cameos, but it's Ewan McGregor's slick operative who really matters ‚Äì till our wraith-like antiheroine, a character deserving of more adventures, moves in.

Permalink",False,"Dear Mr. Sonderberg please read this, I promise to keep it brief. Here's what I liked:

1. The fights are well done. Thank you for not bothering to use exaggerated audio-fx. The fights seem less powerful but also more authentic.

2. Gina Carano. You didn't turn her into a Angelina Jolie/ Milla Jovovich wannabe, which is much appreciated. Women REALLY don't need to be tough chicks AND sexy-playthings at the same time. I hate that in movies, it makes no sense. So thank you for not doing that.

And now what I didn't like:

1. Was it out theater-operator's fault or are a lot of the pictures originally out of focus? If that's the case: Why??

2. The music! Oh God, the music!! It killed a LOT of the suspense. Chillout-lounge music may be okay in Oceans 14 or 15, when it's about efficient and cool storytelling. BUT. NOT. FOR. ACTION. AND. SUSPENSE!!!! Please watch other (real) action movies and learn how music can actually add some thrill rather than kill it off. The music made it impossible to get interested in the story. Like some homeshopping channel. Awful!

That's it, I'm done."

Permalink",False,"Director Steven Soderbergh is on a roll. After directing the well-received medical thriller ""Contagion"", Soderbergh returns to direct this action-thriller about a double-crossed agent, Mallory Kane, who is played by Gina Carano. Freelance covert operative Mallory is hired out by her handler to various global entities to perform jobs that governments cannot authorize and heads of state would rather not know about. However, during a mission in Dublin, she meets Paul, played by a very dashing Michael Fassbender, who, instead of shedding his clothes in the bedroom, sheds his disguise and proceeds to mano-a-mano with Mallory, although she emerges the survivor. Now, fully aware that she has been double crossed, Mallory tries to makes her way back to the United States to exact her revenge.

It is refreshing to finally see a movie that is unpretentious about what it is; a straightforward revenge tale. There is no attempt by the script to assert plausibility or realism, such as how one woman can take down so many trained men so easily. Soderbergh has clearly struck gold with fighter Gina Carano, who is no acting veteran, yet manages to hold her own in this testosterone-laden movie. It is a treat to see A-listers like Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Channing Tatum and Michael Douglas quaking in their boots at the mere mention of Carano's Mallory Kane persona in ""Haywire"". Dialogue and emotion-wise, Carano does not deliver much, but Soderbergh has managed to draw attention away from the problem by choreographing one fight scene after another with raw realism.

Yes, the choreography is the main attraction of the movie, shot with just the right amount of a rough-and-tumble, making the choreographed scenes look as if they were improvised on the spot. There is just enough heart-thumping moments to make you sit up and on the edge of your seat, but you will never be overly afraid for Carano. In fact, you will be rooting for her in every brawl, for whenever Carano hits the walls she does it with so much conviction, as per her nickname in the ring, that you actually feel the walls shaking. Now, other actresses who have attempted such roles, no matter how toned and buff they became, just look like pretenders.

Besides the finely choreographed action sequences, Soderbergh also knows to make a fine choice of locations and mobile filmic methods. Expect nothing new unlike the vertigo- inducing Burj Khalifa scene in ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"", but enough so as to keep things exciting, such as the quick cuts and pans, the rooftop escapes, and the car chases in reverse gear. It is signature Soderbergh, and even the soundtrack in ""Haywire"" does not miss the beat. All the action is backgrounded with a generally chirpy but serious-when- it-needs-to-be tone set by composer David Holmes, whose choice of blues, jazz and techno music can be occasionally jarring.

In conclusion, ""Haywire"" is Soderbergh's venture into indie waters with his bet on untested talent Gina Carano and boy, does it pay off. For those who were wondering what Bond or Bourne would be like if they were women, ""Haywire"" is the answer. It is definitely one of the better movies to begin the year with, if not for the star-studded cast. Move aside, Angelina Jolie and Milla Jovovich, there is a new woman fighter in town"

So where do I start.. with a cast of many famous faces - you would expect this thriller to be a class act - but for me nobody really stood out.. The story itself was a sort of Bourne meets Lara Croft thing with Gina Carano playing the leading roll... The plot is confusing the music very annoying and all it all (for me) doesn't really get hold of you by the balls.. Fair play - it's a good ride and the action - especially the fight scenes are very well made - but the rest is bitty at best and lacks a professional finish which as they say ""could have made it so much better""

Permalink",False,"First of all, before anyone replies me, telling, that im simply just a ""hater"" who WANTS to dislike this movie, let me tell you, I spent my (heardearned) money renting this DVD, hoping so much to like it, hoping to be well entertained, a female ""Bourne"" or maybe even ""007""?, maybe even watching it again before returning it. Sadly this movie fails in all departments - and I wish i'd taken the time to read more reviews before renting, in order NOT to waste almost 2 hours of my life, better spent taking a walk in the rain.

My initial thought was, ""Michael Douglas is in it - it cant be bad"" - it wasn't just bad, it was terrible. The acting sucks (except the few scenes with MD), the plot/story is awfully executed, and...... this is rare.... but HAS to be mentioned - the choice of Background-music is odd to say the least, its extremely irritating, to the point, i preferred to mute it and put on subs (seriously!)

Im really thinking about something positive to say about this movie, but I cant. If this was a sci-fi-flick, think of it, as if you are hoping to see ""Starwars"" or ""Aliens"", but instead you are getting ""Naked Lunch"", served with the soundtrack of a cheap bar.

Do yourself a favor, watch something else.... anything.... really!"

Permalink",False,"On paper this seemed a good choice to watch, being about an agent who gets revenge on people who have betrayed her. Unfortunately, this was to be completely misguided, as I lost 90 minutes of my life watching this pretentious nonsense.

It didn't bode well from the off when boring background music played through big parts of the film, and I did wonder if it was a television movie in disguise. Poor acting & confusing plot didn't help, though the fight sequences were good.

Lead Gina Carano may be a poor actress but she can certainly fight, and looked very convincing bashing the male population into oblivion. She is certainly a statuesque girl that is for sure. At least she had an excuse, which is more I can say for the rest of the cast such as Ewan McGregor & Michael Douglas who were awful.

So if you are looking for a movie with good plot, quality acting, & an enjoyable experience, look somewhere else as you certainly wont get it viewing this turd."

Permalink",True,"OK, who the hell is Gina Carano? In a movie that actually had a decent storyline, This Gina person completely ruined the movie for me. I have always felt that Channing Tatum is a dismal actor, but to watch a movie where he was not the worst actor really pained me.

It took me 3 tries to get through this movie. I am just glad I did not have to pay to see it. I feel like Simon on American Idol, dashing out the painful truth, without tact. Gina Carano's acting performance in this movie was HORRIBLE. To build a movie around her is box office suicide. Maybe the producers only had $127 for casting, I don't know, but this was a potentially good movie, completely destroyed by an awful acting performance. Hey, Channing Tatum was bad in this, but he was not the worst element of the film. Watch at your own peril.

What a waste of a good cast which reads like a who's who of top actors in Hollywood today.

Luc Besson is 10 times better than Sodebergh at this kind of movie.

Permalink",False,"First of all - I created an account into IMDb just to write a review about this one.

This movie is by far one of the worst of this kind. It seemed to me that they were trying to do a pilot movie for some TV show that was to be introduced after the releasing. Bad sounds effects, bad visual effects, bad screenplay. Such an incredible waste of the talented actors that worked in this one. And Banderas? How about his character? Fassbander does a little share in the movie with really good acting, despite the real small amount of time he is on. Douglas (again) plays a ""I'm the best"" character, with the same speech, gestures and looks from all the movies he works on. Actually I have a thesis about Douglas - one could use the acting from one movie in all the others just doing copy&paste and still it would be convincing that he actually had worked for that special one. So, summarizing - If you have an enormous will to see this movie, just get your old copy of Bourne trilogy or some nice movie from Hanks and be happy. Don't waste your time seeing this one.

The movie was poorly organized, presented throughout the narrative of the lead actress. (who for some reason decides to tell all about her exciting adventures pretending to be Bourne, to some random stranger that is introduced in the first scene. the random stranger is never explained, or used in the film in any other way) Close to nothing is explained, leaving the audience wondering what was happening, but not creating any reason to care what was happening either. The only way this film was entertaining was that it was slightly funny to roast it.

Permalink",True,"All kudos to Gina Carano! She is the best and no criticism of her acting or fight scenes. If not for her lame director this would definitely have been her intro into action films (and hopefully still will be) Steven Soderburgh on the other hand has a lot to answer for in this half-finished attempt at? I mean it is top heavy with big names and all of the actors have done much, much better work so I do not blame them for what appears on screen. I mean WTF Steven did you forget post-production? The score is sleep inducing and generic and the pacing languid. The fight scene choreography could have been kicked up a notch or two (no criticism of Gina) and the editors have to stop taking so much Valium before the cut. I give respect to those who did the trailer, even if it has little to do with the feeling of the movie - it promises much that is not delivered. Maybe it was made for a European audience. I gave it a 5 just because of Gina Carano who is buff and quick. I give a -5 to Soderbergh - too much Zoloft the night before Steve? Everyone should be given the right to fail and I guess this is Soderbergh's. I recommend it only for Gina.

Permalink",False,"I didn't expect much of Haywire, since I saw it on a flip while duelling one of those afternoon hangovers that debilitate in the most tedious of ways. To my pleasured surprise it eased my brow, quickened my pulse and even made me smile, though imperfect certainly one of the better mainstream films I've seen of late. The key to it all is that it isn't a film about plot, but about energy, about the vacuous rush in and as of itself and the smiling knowledge of same. There is a plot, espionage stuff with a highly skilled mercenary lady betrayed and seeking truth, but it doesn't really matter. What matters is the precise yet effortless editing that makes near every other scene transition seem like it could be a suave sleight of hand, the slickly mannered dialogue and of course a handful of action scenes. The dialogue is utterly disposable and all the more winning for it, characters communicate in ticket stubs, crisp signifiers of no content other than meaning understood, but as the film progresses the dialogue builds in effect, it becomes its own little magic trick, mirthful in its knowing superficiality. Superficial but not pointless, by the by the film comes to resemble a paper trail caught in an updraft, twirling fragile shape that catches the eye the more for the threat of dissolution and chaos. Screenwriter Lem Dobbs holds everything together pretty well, though really it's Soberbergh's direction and editing that make everything work. And of course the key joke to the film, that its centre is a non actress and those around her, those in the most clipped of exchanges are often rather good actors. Though I shouldn't be unfair to Gina Carano, the film requires her to be tough and she convinces, it also requires her to fight and she fights well, deploying some cool moves. It also doesn't hurt that she's rather easy on the eye. Around her solid work comes from Ewan McGregor as a slimy mover and shaker, Michael Fassbender as a smooth gay secret agent and Michael Douglas as a handler of sorts, plus a small turn from Bill Paxton as her dad, nobody really excels but all do their bit, low key and convincing enough. My only substantial complaint is a finale that falls a bit flat, for all that the film has been building to it ends on a bit of a whimper, neither exciting nor intriguing enough. Still, it doesn't dispel the good vibes of the rest of the film, given that it is more or less as slick as the rest, and has it logic I guess. All in all I thought this a classy entertainment of an old fashioned yet forward thinking sort, and as action thrillers go worth a look. 7/10 from me."

Permalink",True,"After reading the appreciation of Steven Soderbergh on his website for the James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, I always felt that his own spy movie Haywire (2011) was his answer to the biggest issue of the film: George Lazenby. He writes about Lazenby: ""What seems obvious to me, though, is no one was helping him during the shoot or the edit"" In his spy film Haywire, he gives the lead to an inexperienced actress (Gina Carano) and gets a good performance out of her (there were however some tweaks to her voice in post-production, but this is not an uncommon technique).

The fight scenes are very much like the early James Bond movies such as From Russia With Love, Thunderball and of course On Her Majesty's Secret Service (there even is a beach fight scene).

Other than the fight scenes and the globetrotting plot, Haywire is not very Bondian. It is more an update of the paranoid conspiracy movies from the seventies in Soderbergh style. The plot has a lot of twists and turns: a black ops agent is being setup for assassination.

The other issue Soderbergh has with OHMSS is the length of 142 minutes: ""the film is too long, the longest Bond film until Casino Royale nearly three decades later"". Meanwhile Spectre (2015) has broken this record with 148 minutes. Haywire closes curtains very satisfying at 93 minutes.

Permalink",False,"In typical Soderbergh fashion, it takes a couple of viewings to sort out all of the plot's twists. It's easy to get left behind; the time shifts and the quiet moments of dialogue can trip up a viewer, but it's a slick little thriller. I happen to love Gina Carano in this role; maybe she's not the most flexible line-reader but in her character, it works, and she pulls off the action sequences beautifully. I also was amazed at the star power in the supporting roles. The soundtrack is excellent as well. In short, this is exactly the kind of spy thriller you'd expect from the guy who made Out Of Sight, Ocean's 11-13, Traffic, etc.

Permalink",True,"Oscar winning director Steven Soderbergh of ""Traffic"" whipped together this modest little actioneer about one tough dame who is sold out by the government and destined to be murdered as part of a shady but complicated action. Pioneering Mixed Martial Arts athlete Gina Carano doesn't have the acting chops of her supporting cast, but she acquits herself splendidly in the three major set-pieces involving close-quarters combat with co-stars such as Michael Fassbinder, Channing Tatum, and Ewan McGregor. ""Kafka"" scribe Lem Dobbs has concocted what essentially amounts to a punchy little B-movie, and Soderbergh keeps things hustling at a dizzy pace as Mallory Kane (Gina Carano of ""Blood & Bone"") globe trots around Europe with gunmen on her six. Initially, she takes a contract to assist a British M1-6 agent (Michael Fassbinder) in rescuing a journalist that she believes is being held hostage. The catch is that Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas of ""Desperado"") has engineered a deal with Kane's boss, Kenneth (Ewan McGregor of ""Transpotting""), to have her iced after she rescues the journalist. What nobody is prepared for is Mallory's resilience. She kills Paul in a motel room before he can rub her out. The remainder of the action follows our heroine as she tracks down the rest of the guys who set her up to die. In a sense, this is an existentialist thriller since Mallory has to piece together the plot to murder her from all parties involved in the conspiracy.

The beauty of ""Haywire"" is the hell-bent-for-leather pace that Soderbergh maintains throughout this trim 93-minute melodrama. This Relativity Media release certainly never wears out its welcome. Unfortunately, aside from the pummeling action, there isn't much here to appreciate once you realize that Gina Carano is no cream-puff. She generates considerable credibility during her face to face fight scenes. Soderbergh doesn't tell this tale in chronological order because it would look like something that he knocked out over the weekend. Basically, as Mallory whittles down the opposition, we learn how she came to be in the predicament that she is in. Most of the plot specifics are delivered breathlessly in expository dialogue forays throughout the action. Happily, he has the services of a top-notch cast. Furthermore, when you consider that the Motion Picture Association of America gave this number an R-rating, you have to wonder why. Soderbergh keeps the hard-driving action pretty immaculate in terms of blood and gore. In other words, you won't see virtually any blood and gore, and our heroine and her dastardly opponents never take time out for sex. Soderbergh not only helmed this thriller, but he also served as the editor and cinematographer. Indeed, it is rather refreshing that Soderbergh lensed the action on actual locations in Dublin and Barcelona without relying on the usual visuals that emphasize national landmarks.

At the end of the day, ""Haywire"" boils down to a disposable thriller with a gimmick: its one-of-a-kind woman can actually perform her own stunts. While it is lacking in substance, this nimble actioneer should be something that women will enjoy and men will like watching despite the conspicuous absence of nudity. Michael Douglas and Bill Paxton appear in other supporting roles.

Permalink",False,"Imagine yourself being pursued by all manner of for-profit and government assassins. What do you do? Who can you trust? Can you trust anyone? And is it still possible to make this interesting?

Mallory Kane (played by Gina Carano) is a former Marine employed by a private contractor to deal with clandestine issues of national security for the United States government. When we first see her she is in a diner in a remote area by herself when, moments later, a former coworker by the name of Aaron (played by Channing Tatum) asks her to come with him back to their employer and assaults her when she refuses. Aaron (Tatum) has the upper-hand until a patron in the diner comes to Mallory's aid and this allows Mallory to injure and incapacitate Aaron and escape with said patron, Scott (played by Michael Angarano) in his car. Worried this might be her only chance and looking for any help she can get, Mallory recounts the events that resulted in her being on the run to Scott (Angarano) while he mends her injuries from her encounter with Aaron and she drives. Meanwhile, Mallory's employer and former boyfriend (for lack of a better word) Kenneth (played by Ewan McGregor) is making plans to contain the situation and the inevitable blowback that will result.

Though I didn't know it going in, Carano's voice was dubbed over in the film. Having heard her voice since seeing the movie, I'm not sure of the motivation. Usually the motive for dubbing is inferior acting, inability to speak the language, or incompatibility between the character and the voice of the actor portraying them. I can only assume that she fell short as an actress but it doesn't show on screen. The music chosen by and work of director Steven Soderbergh in addition to the fight scenes are all top-notch. Surprisingly so, as Channing Tatum has not made one film up to this point that I've watched without regretting it later. Great movie."

The cast is top-notch: Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender and the newcomer Gina Carano. The film just has a feel of a rush-job, like all these fantastic actors had other things to do. The result was a series of epic fight scenes with not much in between. If you're not concerned about plot or character development, this is your film. My lament is that it easily could have incorporated an improved story line and really had a nice little film. Gina Carano is a revelation. The screen loves her, and her incredible fight sequences show that she is a bona fide action star waiting to happen. I would've cast her in The Avengers as Black Widow. I truly hope she's not a one and done star in the vein of Jon Cena (he sucks).

Permalink",False,"Ignore the plot, it's not really important, it's the old double-crossed-spy-seeks-revenge script dragged out and dusted off for another showing. But you'll want to see this one because it's done a little differently, as you'd expect from Soderbergh.

Impressive cast of course, but as usual with Soderbergh these guys are only there to warm up the crowd for the main act; Gina Carano. Soderbergh apparently wrote this specifically for her, and in the second half of the film you'll understand why.

The opening scenes have a raw, almost unedited quality, and I had to do a double-take to make sure I was indeed watching the right film. There's a Tarantino quality in the dialogue, but it's a bit pedestrian and low key until about halfway through when you get to one of the most visceral and reality-grounded fight scenes I've ever seen in a movie - and it's made all the better by the fact that Gina Carano is a genuine mixed martial arts (MMA) champion. I hadn't come across her before, so it's an interesting twist to see what you thought was just another pretty but delicate actress suddenly start kicking the bejesus of these big name actors. It's like watching a more aggressive female Jason Bourne, but without the fast cut editing and dramatic soundtrack. This... well, looks far more real. Probably because most of it is; she did all her own stunts.

If you're thinking ""Salt"" right now, I can put your mind at rest; this is really much better and far less Hollywood. Carano is fascinating to watch, clearly abundantly feminine, but with a masculine energy and aggression in her fight scenes. This is one lady you don't want to cross. And she's got acting chops too; pretty impressive as this is her first major role. This is no wooden bodybuilder like Stallone or Schwartzenegger, her performance is measured and nuanced. She is definitely an up and coming actress to watch - I'd be interested to see if she can break out of the action genre and do something more ""serious"". With this film on her CV, I think she just might.

If you're in the mood for something a little off the beaten action track, then this spy caper with Soderbergh's trademark slick style just might be what you're looking for."

The real thrills and action were not substituted with computer generated apocalyptic conflagrations which render almost all the recent Hollywood production boringly unwatchable. David Carradine and Henry Silva were traded for Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, Mathieu Kassovitz, Michael Fassbender and Michael Douglas so the deal was more than fair. The picture did not lack neither the car chase nor the rooftop jumping and in the end the final line of ""oh sh*t"" I am absolutely certain was followed by a magnificent roundhouse kick.

I like action films and I like cinematic art and this felt like an interesting mixture of the two (a bit like Drive). It also had a dream like quality pervading a lot of the scenes which I liked. I'll admit I find it difficult to picture females in aggressive roles but she played the part well. The rooftop sequence was good but very similar to a Jason Bourne film. The fight scenes looked realistic. Overall I'd prefer a little more character development but I think the film worked well. 7 stars from me.

The movie is just okay, but the potential in Ms Carano is overwhelmingly obvious. I just hope she does not succumb to Hollywood's typical level of ""success"" through tabloid nonsense and propaganda. She is better than that - in fact she has more talent in her pinky than 99% of the rest of us. Those dissing the film don't get it.

Permalink",True,"I got this movie on DVD from my local public library. I watched the movie not knowing anything about it, and especially nothing about Gina Carano. I commented to my wife, ""I like her, she seems real and when she is running it really looks like she is an athlete.""

Well as most everyone else already knew, Gina Carano is a professional mixed martial arts fighter, and a very successful one at that. Soderberg saw her and decided it would be good to build a story around her, and that turned into ""Haywire."" As interesting as the movie is the 16-minute special on Carano and the training she went through for the movie. I came away very impressed, she is a bona fide action star.

The movie itself requires a lot of patience because it starts in what might be considered present time, then the long story of how we got there is told in flashback form as she is fleeing in a car and telling it to the car's owner. It seems pretty confusing for most of the first half because we have no idea what is happening or why. But it is all tied up eventually, if you have patience and watch and listen closely.

Gina Carano is Mallory Kane, a sort of 'black ops' type of person who clearly is very good at what she does. As the movie starts in upstate New York someone is meeting with her to try to bring her in voluntarily. But she doesn't 'volunteer.' She commandeers the car belonging to Michael Angarano as Scott and she explains it as they flee. The agent who tried to bring her in is Channing Tatum as Aaron.

The cast is all-star with the likes of Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor, and others. There aren't too many good guys, it seems most of them are out to eliminate Mallory and that translates into almost nonstop action for most of the 90 minutes.

We enjoyed it, especially because of the fantastic Gina Carano. Plus I always like movies where a beautiful woman kicks butt, over and over and ...

Permalink",False,"Having enjoyed the Bourne series, and since this movie offers a few interesting actors , I decided to check out the 'female Bourne'. Others have pointed out that it's not the most original plot to come along, and it's true. It could have been a better story and I wish it had been in order to do justice to the excellent work of the actors, although I found the screen writing overall to be enjoyably and suitably concise, since the characters in this world must by nature spend a lot more time listening and watching than talking.

Despite the shortcomings of the plot, it's well executed. The story ends up being the very immediate experience of Mallory's character and the people she's fighting--the men she's fighting, which does add a clear but utterly controlled sexual dimension to the mix. The combat feels very real, though also artistic in a way that I appreciated. I don't particularly like violence but was pulled into each major fight, really noticing each turn of the tide and each opportunity to take advantage of a weakness, feeling not just the pain but the risk each injury creates for the combatants. It doesn't take long to see that this woman is a natural, both the actress and the character. Despite the hints we get at an ""out-of-control"" violent past, Mallory's about being good at what she does; thorough, keen, vigilant, instinctive, relentless, confident without arrogance. We see a capable lethality but no traces of any supposed psychotic rage, which was fine with me. I'd hire her for any job at all in a split second, including the one she has in the movie. But she has neither a believable tragic flaw nor a hidden/personal agenda, and that made the predictable conflict that was manufactured seem flimsy (though it was refreshing to have a main character who isn't a tortured soul). I would have liked to see more of this character, but unless they can come up with a better reason for a second movie than a revenge-fest, it's hard to see how they can justify it. To see Mallory come back with nothing more than a chip on her shoulder and a score to settle would be a disappointing premature end to a promising career. Probably better to leave it at this one as Carano's feature debut.

Nevertheless, I'd like to see more of the kind of work that went into this. Gina Carano is easy on the eyes, tough and strong but not 'roided out, still very female. Not hard to see why Soderbergh wanted to make a movie just to put her in. All I know about her comes from the DVD extras and watching her in this film. Not just any talented fighter could step into a role like this; she trained like a madwoman to add some demanding new weapons and choreographic skills to her repertoire, and although the spare script didn't challenge her to a lot of dialogue acting, she seemed quite natural and believable in her non-combat screen time, and seemed like she actually knew what she was doing. I really enjoyed watching her with Tatum, McGregor and especially Fassbender. There were many ingredients here worthy of trying again in a different recipe."

Basically Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is a freelance covert operative, she works for various global entities when hired by her handler to perform the jobs that governments cannot authorise and the heads of state would rather not know about. She is assigned on a mission to go to Barcelona and rescue a hostage, and then follows an assignment in Dublin, but this mission goes wrong and she is framed in some way to become an international target herself. Mallory finds out she has been double crossed and is on the hunt, using all her skills, tricks and abilities to escape the manhunt and gets answers from the people who would know what has happened and exact her revenge on the traitors, returning to the United States and she also has to protect her family. Also starring Ewan McGregor as Kenneth, Channing Tatum as Aaron, Michael Fassbender as Paul, Antonio Banderas as Rodrigo, Michael Douglas as Alex Coblenz, Bill Paxton as John Kane, Mathieu Kassovitz as Studer and Michael Angarano as Scott. I will be honest and say I didn't pay as full attention as I probably should have done, I just about understood what was going on, at least I spotted all the good faces of the cast, and I suppose the moments I did see had some interesting parts, like near the end when McGregor is trapped in-between rocks as the tide comes in on a beach, it did not have enough chases or explosions that I think it needed, but it's an alright action thriller. Worth watching, at least once!

Permalink",False,"Haywire feels like a film that is in need of a decent story and script and I have to blame Steven Soderbergh for most of the films problems. According to the DVD extras he saw Gina Carano fighting and thought that she would be great in a film. Unfortunately he didn't think that the film would have to have a decent plot or script.

The film does have a plot but unfortunately it is very convoluted and messy, with huge holes and lazy story telling. The script feels rushed, everything is focused on getting Gina Carano into the next action or fight scene.

Sonderbergh has been smart in a few areas. He has brought in some very good actors to back up Carano but they are generally given little to do and the dialogue is generally terrible. I didn't think Gina Carano was terrible as the lead and she is very convincing when she is battery the hell out of everyone. She isn't given much to do acting wise and this is maybe a good thing. Michael Fassbender is always good, though he isn't given much to work with. A similar story can be said of Michael Douglas. Ewan McGregor feels terribly miscast and I have to say that this is easily the worst performance I have seen from him.

The fight and action scenes are handled very well and the cinematography is generally very well done. Gina Carano is easily the toughest action heroin and the fights are both brutal and convincing. One fight in particular reminded me of the fight between Sean Connery and Robert Shaw in From Russia with Love.

One of the areas I really hated was the editing style and music. It felt very similar to the Ocean 11 films and took a lot of edge off of the film.

Over all I was very disappointed with the film. It isn't bad but it barely gets a 6 from me. I will look out for Gina Carano, I think she could be a stand out action star, if given the right movie and some more acting lessons."

In all seriousness, I was drawn in by what appeared to be an entertaining film with an almost all-star cast and an established director. The thought that this might in fact be a student film kept popping into my head pretty much every time the lackluster--and horribly repetitive score--kicked in. Most reviews I have read here are exonerating Ms.Carano of most charges--and not simply because she could break most of our necks without a modicum of effort--but the rest of the people involved with this film should know better, and I believe they do. As Ewan McGregor says to Mr. Fassbender when the professionalism of an operation is called into question: ""It's about money. It's always about money.""

The plot, which is almost non-existent, crawls along with seemingly no purpose, and even as all the truths are revealed you find yourself bored instead of surprised. The amount of lines Gina Carano has could be written on a bar napkin.

The fighting is well done and well rehearsed, but the suspending disbelief is too much too handle in a film that tries to portray itself with any sense of realism. The amount of hand-to-hand combat in lieu of guns sets it on par with a Jackie Chan or Jean Claude Van Dam action caper.

Steven Soderbergh is one of the most talented directors out there with a host of quality films under his belt, but sadly this is not one of them.

Haywire's biggest flaw is its crummy sound effects, and a score that detracts from the movie more than someone's phone going off in the theater.

At some point Steven Soderbergh probably got a hard-on for Carano and thought she would be perfect for one of his action films. Nevertheless, you can't hide her terrible acting by cramming in a lot of other talented actors; plus nobody's heart seems to be in this film. We've seen way better performances from all these actors: Michael Douglas (Falling Down), Michael Fassbender (X-Men: First Class), Antonio Banderas (Desperado), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting), and my always favorite goober Bill Paxton (Apollo 13).

Soderbergh hasn't proved himself to me yet as a good director, and his prior films: Ocean's 11, 12, 13, Traffic, and Contagion are perfect examples of him merely relying on star power."

Permalink",False,"It's just a poor effort and a bad movie.

The star of this film was not ready to carry a movie in the lead role. I would have preferred to see her as a menacing martial arts figure, aka Jet Li or Zhang Zhiyi in the Lethal Weapon / Rush Hour movies, or a ""boss type"" bad guy with a significant role as in Kill Bill's women. First efforts by the Rock, Justin Timberlake, Eminem and others that were simply portraying themselves, were actually better. The addition of all the big name Hollywood stars as supporting cast is not nearly enough to boost this movie into something worthy of commendation.

The entire production has the feel of a very amateur film student working with his buddy on the karate team to make a movie. The obligatory scenes were included - car chase, foot chase, etc... but they were checks in the box rather than necessary or compelling. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion, including Gina's speed of speech and thought. That's when she was talking - lot's of the film included boring music playing in the background while she scaled a wall, jumped over something, ran, etc... The fight scenes demonstrated the legitimate power from her well muscled legs at times, but otherwise seemed lackluster, weak and poorly choreographed. In one shootout scene, the choice weapons were submachine guns with red tabs on them, giving the weapons a very non-threatening, ""training only"" type of look.

The film was decidedly focused on showcasing Gina Carano in a variety of environments, but the result to the viewer looks more like a first rehearsal of a 9th grade movie project and not a Hollywood movie.

Yes, it's doubtful a 9th grader could make this movie, but you get the point... How a top tier Director put out this movie is beyond me. How did this make it past the studio executives?

Compared to action flicks starring women (Salt, Hannah, Colombiana, etc...) I think Haywire is one of the worse.

But since I love fighting movies, MMA in all forms, boxing, Bourne type movies and all that - I couldn't wait to watch it and found enough pleasure in some of the fight scenes to finish the movie (which wasn't the case for 9 people of out my 1/5 packed movie theater on Day 2 of release). I like watching Gina Carano fight in competition and she looks fit and sexy throughout the feature. I think she was done a disservice by being thrown into a low budget, poorly written and poorly directed movie.

Gina do another movie, but be more careful with your career. Be a bruiser for a little while, that's your way in, but try to learn the craft a little better."

Permalink",False,"First things first; let's get the obvious out in the open before I rip to shreds the disaster that is HAYWIRE. Director Steven Soderbergh thrills working with Hollywood royalty. How he convinces some of his cast to sign up with his productions is indeed one of the greater mysteries to this enthusiast. As the saying goes it's not who you are but who you know that matters!

Treading along the same footsteps as his 2011 first release CONTAGION I find HAYWIRE equally as appalling or if not even a tad bit worse. Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton and Channing Tatum are not able to put together and see through to success the disaster that which is HAYWIRE.

The department of acting isn't all that unwatchable. In fact the script written by Lem Dobbs has no character development nor depth just as it lacks a sensible plot. The men do know what is expected out of them. They are expected to narrate lines written by Dobbs and not directed by Soderbergh. If Soderbergh did bother for a moment the production would have at least been watchable as were his OCEANS trilogy. The strangest addition or if may call it the thing is the protagonist of HAYWIRE; Gina Carano; who is the most out of place cast member amongst them all. If Soderbergh is scoping out for new talent or if he ran out of budget to pay a famous actress is only a question the man himself can answer. Gina Carano never connects with her character Mallary on any level. The audience never does feel that Mallary is a helpless black ops fugitive who is being framed. The only saving grace for Carano is that she indeed does know how to put up a fight and throw a punch. HAYWIRE swings towards being a thriller moreover than being an action flick. So my question is, where is the suspense and the intensity? With ratings ranking in the above average segment I am at crossroads on my opinion. I cannot but wonder if I am a minority of those who hated the movie.

Simply said, do not be fooled by the name Steven Soderbergh. The man was absolutely whimsical in the OCEANS trilogy. Somewhere along the years he seems to have obviously lost that magical mojo. Every 2011 release of Soderbergh is been putrid to me. Let's all just hope MAGIC MIKE will bring forth change to the Soderbergh name.

Mallary a covert operative is being framed by the very people she works for. There is absolutely nothing else I can say about the synopsis since there is nothing else that the movie talks about.

First of all, if you gonna copy a plot that's been done 100 times before, copy it properly and get a hot chick for the leading role, not a lesbian looking chubby miss unknown.

Not to mention the bad sound effects, meaningless lines thrown by actors, the useless waste of film time in walking and running and worst of all is this Gina chick who looked like she was dubbed and performed as well as a porn star before the sex scene. A friend of mine recommended me this movie and said its like the Bourne Identity, but with a female. Well sorry, but trying to compare these two is like comparing the Godfather with Sex & The City 2. Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, even Mathieu Kassovitz - all great actors with a black spot because of this film exercise. How can one make movies like Traffic, Oceans 11 and Solaris create such a trash? Didn't he say he was retiring? Or this is just for the lake house?

Why, she doesn't know; but she realizes that her life is definitely in danger and the only way she will survive is to outwit and outlast her enemies. The story line is pretty shaky at best with just enough dialog to break up the power packed fight scenes. This martial arts operative kicks ass all the way through the cast. She gives as good as she gets. A white-knuckle action flick with no CGI or unbelievable stunts. You can't say that Carano's acting skills are stellar, but there is some top notch names rounding out the cast: Michael Angarano, Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Antonio Bandaras, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton and Ewan McGregor.

Gina Carano comes across very stiff, she is playing a Black Ops soldier but it looks like she took inspiration from the lifeless soldiers of Call of Duty. The fight scenes are impressive at first but then seem unconvincing and overly rehearsed, maybe they were learning dance sequences from Channing in-between takes. The soundtrack is very Ocean's Eleven-esque, and after looking at who composed the music for Haywire, I can understand why: same guy.

There is one good thing I could say about Haywire; the locations all look very authentic. Yeh, that's it. So many great actors went into creating this film: Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, yet what was produced was some cheesy special agent flick with war paint and catch phrases.

Unfortunately i was left disappointed, the only good part of the film for me, was the fight scenes. Well executed, if a little over the top in parts. But this really is the only good point of the film. I found the whole story confusing and pointless, and for the calibre of actors in the film, i was surprised they couldn't have done better. The sound track through out the film is incredibly annoying, it doesn't suit the film at all. A lot of the acting was drab, and un inspiring. I was happy when the film ended so i could walk out and forget about it. Overall i expected more, i wanted to like this film but i really couldn't.

Permalink",False,"What is a movie? Is it a collection of moving pictures? A gathering of actors? Or, a movie-going experience? Well, if it IS the latter, then, with his latest creation, Haywire, Steven Soderbergh creates something new. A movie for a film director.

Just like ""Girlfriend Experience"", Soderbergh takes a specialist (Gina Carano), adds a smattering of good actors (who, no doubt, love working with Soderbergh), weak storyline, haphazard score, shoddy continuity, and, creates a ""proof of concept"". Not a movie to be enjoyed by average moviegoer, but, rather, a movie just to prove that ""this CAN be done"".

Carano is spectacular when it comes to stunts, having captured multiple muay-thai and MMA belts, looks truly phenomenal in either evening gown or a pair of jeans, yet, still fails to present herself as someone who's capable of carrying a movie. Watching her scene in the hangar with Michael Douglas is almost physically painful.

So, what has Mr. Soderbergh left us with? A pleasant experience? Nope. Storyline is weak. A collection of amazing stunts? Well, ""Mission Impossible"" has better stunts. A documentary of Gina's truly phenomenal fighting skills? Nope, it's a movie. Everything's staged.

Then, for whom did Mr. Soderbergh make this film?

It would appear, the only person such a flick would appeal to. Himself."

However, suffice it to say that I will not get that 1.55 hours back in my life. The writing and directing in this movie was less than deplorable. If I had to guess the script was approximately 10 pages long. The fight scenes were not what I expected at all from MMA fighter Gina Carano. Granted she is a pretty girl who was placed in the wrong script/movie. There was zero through-line of plot, 45 seconds closeup of Carano running after a villain?, several painful minutes of her trying to climb up and down buildings to run away. Come on guys if you want to believe that she is a seasoned assassin for the CIA and former Marine Bulldog, she will have a bit more fluidity in her movements given she is a seasoned veteran of the above listed. The consensus of the few people sitting around me last night were also disappointed at the absolutely poor quality in this film.

I did enjoy seeing the different facets of the lead character, and Gina Carano did a good job as the chameleon needed for the role. Overall, the plot was weak, with extra people thrown in and no support for their role. The guy who helps her out at first... why take him with her? Telling him all her history-- an agent like she is supposed to be would NEVER do that. Then there's the dying Lots of dying. Random, unnecessary killing that neither added to the plot, or supported the premise that Mallory was a former Marine who was still a ""good guy."" And her Dad??? There was no depth to his character at all. He wandered around his house and contributed little to the story line.... just taking up space. A lot of emphasis was placed on the fact that he was the only one she trusted, but that led nowhere... He didn't give her any support, help, or hardly even affection.

Permalink",False,"Haywire is a lot like last year's Drive. What both lack in substance, they make up for in style. Likewise, both could be dismissed as pulp dreck if their respective directors hadn't classed up the material. Haywire isn't as riveting as last year's sleeper hit, but the way Steven Soderbergh stages and choreographs the action elevates it from generic genre fare; especially apparent in contrast to its opening weekend competition: Underworld Awakening.

Punctuated by terse life-or-death scuffles between a badass black ops agent and her would- be assassins, it's no wonder Soderbergh hired martial artist slash actress Gina Carano (not to be confused with Carla Gugino). Of her handful of big screen credits, Haywire is by far the biggest deal; her casting is a move reminiscent of another recent Soderbergh flick ‚Äî The Girlfriend Experience, which marked the dramatic debut of porn star Sasha Grey.

Both actresses fit well in the roles Soderbergh picks for them, but I question how well either would come off when working with a director less versed in coaching non-actors. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Carano's performance is that she holds her own in such formidable company: Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Bill Paxton, Antonio Banderas, etc. Channing Tatum. The list goes on.

Their collective effort is in large part what makes Haywire such a breezy watch. 93 minutes soaking wet, the film flashes backwards and forwards in its narrative to keep the momentum from faltering (and also, I reckon, to gussy up a simplistic espionage tale). The IMDb synopsis says it all: ""A black ops super soldier seeks payback after she is betrayed during a mission."" The film's final moment perfectly reflects the entirety: cheesy, cheeky, fun, and ultimately, forgettable.

Famous for his Hollywood haggling to get passion projects off the ground (""One for me, one for you""), Soderbergh is blurring the line between his studio pictures and personal films. With Haywire, the lack of marketing oomph and no-name lead suggest it might fall into the ""One for me"" category, especially after his crowd-pleasing Contagion. But if the audience I saw it with was any indication, Haywire is no less accessible.

Nor does it feel as obligatory as, say, an Oceans sequel. For the most part, Soderbergh brings his A-game, although I do take issue with the cheapo aesthetic. The harsh digital look he seems fond of works in low-key experiments like Bubble, but feels out of place in a fast- paced action flick. Dim, bland interiors with overblown light sources lend to the film's overall disposable vibe.

But while it lasts, Haywire is an enjoyable January actioner. Though it pales in comparison to Nicolas Winding Refn's excellent Drive, they have a lot in common: a bare bones story spearheaded by a brutal and ruthless protagonist, and a director who knows how to play them to maximum effect. Drive skews operatic while Haywire skews goofy, but both provide more compelling action sequences than any of last summer's blockbusters, Contagion included.

Plus, this time of year empirically means slim pickins for the discerning cinephile. It's either this or Underworld, folks. I'll give you a minute."

Permalink",False,"The kick-butt female action flick is the only way action junkies can get a fix away from the Redbox renegades and whatever Jason Statham has been up to. There's just something more PC about a girl crunching bones in the 2010's, in the least there's something marketable. When I was a kid, anything with a female protagonist was by default for girls. Might as well paint her guns barrels pink and slap a Hello Kitty decal on the boots.

Obviously something has changed when two female led actionfests (Underworld: Awakening, Haywire) can open nationwide on the same weekend. A quick look at the two films shows that the leads couldn't be more different. Underworld: Awakening has classical beauty Kate Beckinsale doing, with the aid of computers, the maneuvers that Haywire star Gina Carano has mastered in MMA sporting events.

Haywire takes a very played out story about betrayal and interjects the newfound feminist biological weapon. Mallory Kane (Carano) is on the run. She's been setup and I probably shouldn't say much more about it. Unfortunately I can confirm that there isn't a sound reason beyond jealousy for her to be in this position.

Director Steven Soderbergh has a habit of taking non-actors and placing them at the front of his work. Carano is his latest find. She does well with her lines, but I can't help to think exchanges were simplified for her benefit. There isn't an effort to coax a performance out of her as she's set on maintaining indifference. What she does bring to the table is a multitude of cool looking moves. Springboarding off a wall for kick and twisting through the air with a punch sure look sweet and go a long way in making something out of this nothing.

As for the filmmaking techniques on hand, Haywire is descriptive Soderbergh. For the heck of it, there is a Quincy Jones inspired score that overrides action scenes. I've never seen a movie have as tough of a time picking a look and going with it. A few outdoor scenes are desaturated, indoor oversaturated, natural lighting at the end¬Ö it's like these are scenes lifted from other movies then pasted together.

Haywire packs some punches‚Äîin a carry-on. Cool fisticuffs here and there, some interesting takes on stunt driving, but the story doesn't hold it all together. Hopefully Carano can develop into an actress, but this isn't a star-making turn. **"

I kept watching till the end thinking that maybe it would improve but it didn't, lucky it's a short movie. And the awful music was just another nail in it's coffin, what the hell was that music they kept on playing.

I made my wife watch it and I was actually embarrassed, I thought about just turning it off a number of times, wish I had done... well, that's 90 minutes of my life I would get back"

I fail to understand how anyone could rate this at all. With such an ensemble cast obviously one expects at least to sit through the movie. A confused plot-line, no hint of acting and dialogue that seems to written on the back of tissue paper or made up as they went along while everyone was bored out of their brains. I don't want to write off the lead actress here and am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and all that. But Mr. Soderbergh did you do this because you lost a bet or something? Absolute drivel that's to be avoided at all costs.

See Mallory betrayed. See Mallory kill for revenge. Kill, Mallory, kill!

I suppose you could say the same for a lot of movies in this genre, but this is easily the worst of the lot. I actually fell asleep during some stretches of the movie.

About the only thing of interest was the absence of music during the fight scenes, but this made the foley work (fake punching sounds) obvious.

Wait until Netflix if your mission is to see every revenge flick ever made.

The film started of very slowly, expecting the pace to pick up, it didn't! I previously saw the trailer and was expecting this film to be similar to Colombina, but was left disappointed. The action scenes were not that great, there was no great performances all round. It was pretty confusing to watch, as the scenes kept chopping and changing throughout and had to quickly remember back to earlier on in the film to get some kind of understanding what was happening later on. This film could have been made better and as a TV Production student at university, I identified many flaws which could be improved. Starting with the actors! There was some good camera shots which is why I gave this film a 2. This film is meant to be action packed, but the pace of the film is so slow that when the fight scenes do appear you are already either half asleep or waking your friend up.

WTF? Why would you do that? To impress the bad guy with magical skills by being next to the doors and then suddenly jumping from the roof? Yes, the bad guy hasn't had even a gun.

I was bored and wishing that I could get a refund on the admission. There were times when the movie started to pick up, but then once again quickly died. I spent a lot of time looking at my wife and asking ""What"" I was very impressed with Mallory Kane who appears to be doing a lot of her own stunts in this movie. The rest of the cast, being some big name stars, just did brief appearances and did not help with the overall movie going experience, for me anyway.

Permalink",True,"Having just purchased Haywire on Blu Ray, I can honestly say it is worthy of an extremely rare accolade : that of being only the 2nd movie EVER that I've sat down to watch and then found I had to turn it off before the end. (Incidentally, the only other movie I've ever had to switch off before the end was Charlie's Angels 2, so you can see the kind of esteem I hold this film in).

It's worth pointing out that I'm not a teenager (I'm late 30's), I believe I'm well educated, I don't tend to leave my brain at the door whenever I sit down to watch a movie, and I don't suffer from attention deficit disorder. I have to say this because so many positive reviewers like to claim that not liking a film has something to do with a lack of intelligence or ""not getting it"". So, with that out of the way, I can safely say that I found this film (like practically everything Mr Soderbergh directs), to be dull, boring, pointless, and trying to be far too ""arty"" for it's own good. The script is weak, the acting is poor, the direction is ""peculiar"" to say the least, the music/sounds are a constant distraction, and I even found the (alleged) ""action"" sequences boring and predictable. I'm surprised how many people say they found this movie fresh and new : I found it to be totally the opposite - i.e. seen it all before, and no amount of strange sounds and weird music choices can change that.

My evening of attempting to watch this with my better half went something like this -

Me - ""Let's watch Haywire. I bought it today on the basis that the reviews on IMDb are generally good and the cast looks great"".

Her - ""OK, you put it on and I'll get the wine""

25 mins later

Me - ""Bit slow this isn't it? And why is she telling a guy who's car she's just stolen her entire life story?""

Her - ""Glad you said that, I thought it was me! I can't stand any of the characters so far and I really hate the way they speak - so unnatural. People don't behave like that!""

5 mins later

Her - ""What's this supposed to be? Action? Thriller? What...""

Me - ""Not sure. What it IS though is deeply boring, plus I'm getting a headache from that god-awful music and weird camera work.""

Her - ""Is there a plot, or indeed a point, to any of this?""

Me - ""Errr......""

10 mins later

Me - ""This is junk""

Her - ""You're damn right!""

Me - ""Had enough?""

Her - ""Yep""

Me - ""Fancy a cup of tea and we'll watch the news instead?""

Her - ""Two sugars please""

Once again Soderbergh excels himself by taking a potentially exciting genre and turning it into an experiment into tedium. On the basis of this and his last few movies, I seriously have to question his directorial abilities : frankly I'd be surprised if he could direct someone to the toilet in his own house. He's fast becoming my least favourite director with quite the back catalogue of stinkers to his name - Ocean's 12, Ocean's 13, Solaris, The Limey, Contagion, The Good German, to name but a few.......

From now on if I see 4 specific words attached to a film (those words being, ""Directed"", ""By"", ""Steven"", and ""Soderbergh"") I'll save myself the bother of watching it, and immediately file it under, ""Never to be watched all the time I'm still in control of my faculties"".

The casting was awful too. It really looked like some top acts try to act like some B-Movie actors.... looked wired. McGregor is to big a Star as could he plausible play such a looser running away from a ""girl"". You could read in all of those faces ""When do I get my money...?"".

Storyline is so meh. James Bond type hero gets betrayed by his bosses and starts a revenge. Must be the first Movie of this kind ^^.

And who did the light? Or was that absolute horrid stage lighting made on purpose, so you only saw her face half of the time in the hole movie? No thrill at all, literally hours of running and chasing and you never get these goosebumps, cause you wont fear something could happen to the main cast.

This movie purpose is only to grab your money.

Permalink",True,"Funny enough, it's rare nowadays that a film's title actually sums up my feelings about an individual film, but that is the case with Haywire. A black ops soldier is set up and is now seeking revenge on the people who set her up. The only difference between this film and almost every action flick of the '90s is that it features a female protagonist (actress Gina Carano), and is directed by Steven Soderbergh. Unfortunately, this is not one of Soderbergh's better efforts. It's just when there is nothing new added to this tried story other than a female lead who is nowhere near as charismatic as the male action stars that anchored these kinds of movies in the '90s, why should I watch it? Not to mention, the movie's chaotic pace, that makes it hard to follow, leaving no time for emotion, making this film cold and heartless.

I give Haywire a 4 out of 10!

This is a surprisingly vibrant Movie that is crackerjack in its fisticuffs and gun-play. The fight Scenes are shot from a distance so you can actually see what is happening. Something that is rare in Modern fast cuts and swirling Camera with extreme close-ups to obscure and supposedly heighten the Action. The type of method used here puts to rest the need for that lazy execution.

There is enough Story to satisfy as there are betrayals and thin alliances that are standard Espionage fodder and it hops the Globe in expected fashion. Things move along swiftly and with purpose and as a whole this is an underrated Movie that is a no holds barred barrage of Spies and Contractors converging in an Audience Friendly finish that is worthy of its place in the New Millennium of mayhem provided by the slick Heroine/Hero that are serving on the rough edges of loyalty."

The conflict, due to trust issues, and the expertise of the characters made the violence more acceptable for me. There was actually a decent story here which wasn't overly convoluted. The slow motion/zoom-in style repetition of information or events to help the viewer follow certain aspects of the story was a unique and helpful way of guiding the viewer but not overly done. I am often rewinding movies because I didn't follow something quite closely enough the first time I saw it. That was not necessary here.

The car chase through the woods was unique but kind of silly. (Who can drive that fast in an unknown location and not hit a tree, stump, gully, etc.?!) The fact that she just went off road in a random location, then surrendered after going for so long made no sense.

Gina Carano did well for a novice actress. Her skills are impressive.

Permalink",False,"I can't believe all the hate this film, Haywire is getting from general movie audiences. Critics adored this film, so I find it baffling that there would be a startling difference between the two audiences. Despite offering nothing new and having a plot than have been done so many times before, I couldn't help but enjoy most of this movie. I'm a big sucker for these kind of plots, so I knew I'd like it. I liked some of the action scenes because I got to see some MMA moves in a movie. To the dismay of some people, this film has many scenes of talk so that may throw people off.

Steven Soderbergh's film is about a black ops girl whose government has turned against her. Now Mallory must run from the people she trusted the most.

This is the first movie role Gina Carano has ever done. That being the case, she should improve her acting as she gets more roles. It wasn't great, but she at least shown her ability to be an action heroine. This film boasts an impressive supporting cast by Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Antonio Banderas, and even Bill Paxton. They were all really enjoyable to watch.

Overall, this is a good film even though it did not bring anything new to the table. There are some great fight scenes. If Gina had better acting skills, this would have been a great movie. But for a middle of January release, it's good for what it is. It's better than what people think. I rate this film 8/10."

Permalink",True,"This is an interesting film, though it fails to live up to some of its potential. There is too little suspense behind the setup, and the backstory is incompletely developed (almost completely undeveloped). It seems this was by choice, and I must admit that the recall scenes based on what one character is telling another are an interesting touch.

This isn't deep storytelling and it isn't straight-up non-stop action, but it is a decent film and worth a watch. Ultimately, the best part of the movie is that Carano is believable as a badass.

*spoilers ahead - BE WARNED*

The one aspect of the film that really bothered me was the federal agent tie-in. After being set up and marked for death, Kane all too quickly takes Coblenz's word that he isn't involved and wants the truth. Perhaps the call to Rodrigo is intended to indicate that he, alone, was behind the sell-out (well, with Kenneth, but without the feds). However, I was expecting her to reasonably distrust the feds, as well, especially since Kenneth was able to penetrate that world sufficiently to have the State Troopers hand her over to his people (or, rather, try to do so). Kenneth failing to whack her father after letting him witness a murder is rather thin, as well, though perhaps we are meant to think he isn't a killer (instead an ambitious bureaucrat/businessman who is willing but reluctant to dirty his own hands).

Permalink",False,"Hey, I'm not going to tell you that this is Oscar-grade material; but for my first look at Gina Carano, I was quite impressed.

The action, when done, is short and crisp (as I suspect it probably is in real life) and realistic. I did wrestling and judo at school (a long time ago now), so I tend to prefer grips and throws to strikes, which is probably why I liked Seagal; and Gina's style reminds me quite a lot of his. At the same time (and no offense intended) Gina is a girl, not a 6 foot 4 inch battering ram, so she can't rely on out-and-out strength to win her fights; but the choreography is clever enough to show us how leverage and legs (and Gina does have a fair set of those on her) and a bit of nous can be used to advantage. Even more impressive is how she can climb: You'd definitely want her on your team in Gladiators.

As to the story: it's good enough for this kind of flick - I'm not going to pick it apart here, because it's not why you'd watch - and I quite enjoyed the flashback style of telling it (although the timeline does get a bit confused at times). I also liked the fact that the pace slows between the fight scenes, because it gives them more punch. And, for an action star, Gina beats Steven all ends up when it comes to acting - not that she has an enormous amount of it to do.

So: great film? No. Decent action flick? Yes. You gets what you pays for - and given that the last two Jason Statham movies I watched were crap, I'll probably be looking under C rather than S for my next one.

And maybe Gina will grow into the acting stuff ... Arnold did."

If Cameron Diaz can act in two action movies, I believe that Gina can act in twenty - she's tougher, more credible, and definitely adequately charismatic. I can imagine few women actress who could perform actually that demanding role like that of Mallory Kane in Haywire. The movie has a very interesting beginning and some breathtaking action scene that make it a decent action movie. The weakness of the film is that with that strong cast, Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, Channing Tatum, Michael Fassbender, etc etc one would expect a truly epic action movie. That unfortunately is not the result of Haywire, nevertheless the action is good and worth the watch.

Permalink",False,"'Haywire' stands as an example why I like Steven Soderbergh; no, not just that it's a good film, but primarily because it's essentially a B- movie. When many directors garner unanimous critical acclaim for their more 'serious' work, they are quick to abandon any plans they may have had to direct a genre film. Not Soderbergh, as even though he can deliver more 'weighty' affair such as 'Traffic' or 'Ch√©', he is not afraid to deliver a B-movie alongside these, such as last year's quite good 'Magic Mike' or the film at hand, 'Haywire'.

This movie presents us with a story that's nothing new: a black-ops agent gets double-crossed, framed and left for dead, forcing her on a vengeful mission to find the truth. It could be the plot to a Van Damme or Seagal straight-to-video movie, but what makes it special is the casting of its protagonist. Soderbergh reportedly came across Gina Carano as he was lounging in front of his TV one night and ended up on CBS, where a female-only fighting match was about to kick off. From the moment Carano entered the ring, the director was hooked and knew exactly who would play Mallory Kane in 'Haywire'.

It is undeniable that she has quite some presence on screen; yes, she may not be the most astounding actress ever, but so what? She makes up for it with her magnetic screen presence, exemplified in the film's excellently-crafted fight scenes. When she kicks and punches, you feel it reverberate off the screen and believe that she strikes fear into the hearts of those she is after. ""Don't think of her as being a woman"", remarks Ewan McGregor's shady agent, Kenneth, ""that would be a mistake."" However, she is wisely not portrayed as some invincible superhero, as in one action scene, she falls from a considerable height and injures herself in a way that shows she's only human. Soderbergh populates the rest of this B-Movie's cast with an impressive line-up of A-List stars: Channing Tatum, Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender and Bill Paxton. All of which weave in and out of the narrative, enabling the formidable Carano to firmly and confidently hold her own.

The director makes a number of choices that only he would; there's a bit of time-hopping in the movie's structure, Peter Andrews' cinematography is subtly beautiful and richly dark, while David Holmes' score is deliciously funky and jazzy. The film also oozes cool from beginning to end, and its globe-trotting (Barcelona, Dublin, New York and New Mexico) apply it with the feel of Bond film, albeit an icily cool one. The lack of music in a hotel room fight was also a lovely touch,increasing the brutality of each blow in the scene.

'Haywire' is only a slight film, but it's one that is great B-movie fun nonetheless, never outstaying its welcome at a brisk 93 minutes long. Soderbergh filters the payback movie through his artistic and indie flourishes, but it's Carano who leaves the biggest mark."

Permalink",False,"This movie is unique. But if you are familiar with Sodenbergh style, you will recognize is special photography, score, editing and cryptic dialogs. You have to follow every scene, watch out for every detail and, until the end, you will be lost. As usual, you will have your answer given part by part due to the numerous timelines and characters. So yes it's an action movie but, it privileges slowness, giving us time to appreciate the acting and the stunts: there are so realistic and opposed to the Hollywood usual style that this is refreshing. You actually follow some natural characters, humans with their differences and emotions, but drowned in their own agenda: nothing is like it seems and everything becomes peculiar. Nice and uncommon but quite hard to follow.

Permalink",True,"""My motivation is not financial gain, but a firm belief that the very fabric which holds all of us together will be ripped apart unless every man, woman and child sees this film and pays full ticket price, not some bargain matin√©e cut-rate deal."" - Steven Soderbergh (""Schizopolis"")

""It's an unbeatable market force, man."" - Seth (""Traffic"")

How seriously are we supposed to take Steven Soderbergh's ""Haywire""? Is it an earnest action movie, a parody, or, as snooty French critics are claiming, a ""mediation upon"" and ""deconstruction of genre""?

""Haywire's"" opening and closing words are ""sh*t"", possibly articulating exactly what's in-between. The film's title itself suggests something that has gone completely wrong. If you want to get really pretentious you can also read Soderbergh's casting of stunt woman Gina Carana as some kind of comment; several of the director's previous films have explicitly likened acting/performance/plot to vulgar transactions, most notably 2009's ""The Gilfriend Experience"", which started porn-star Sasha Grey. Here Carana's equally rote and lifeless, suggesting a kind of quasi-pornographic reductionism.

The film's plot is your standard Jason Bourne fare, this time with a female US agent being betrayed and hunted down by her government. The film's action set pieces occur on cue and almost perfectly mirror those found in ""The Bourne Identity"", though Soderbergh directs with a kind of aloof distance. He makes some interesting choices here and there ‚Äì retro music, shockingly sudden violence, a tone which resembles a collision between Godard and Hong Kong cinema etc ‚Äì but it's not enough. Paradoxically this also seems to be point: the film wants to be banal and knows its totally ordinary.

Since ""Schizopolis"", Soderbergh's films have been overtly about money and covertly about capitalism and its discontents. So we have films like ""Traffic"", ""King of the Hill"", ""Contagion"", ""Side Effects"", ""The Informant"", ""The Girlfriend Experience"", ""Che"", ""Schizopolis"", ""Erin Brokovich"" etc, all about recessions, financial depressions, whistle-blowers, shady mega-corporations, exploitation, money, price fixing, self-exploitation, Marxist radicals etc. Even Soderbergh's big budget blockbusters (the ""Ocean"" movies, ""Out of Sight"" etc) are explicitly about cash, or rather theft. Before he started juggling art-house and mainstream pictures, Soderbergh also directed and starred in the autobiographical ""Schizopolis"", which featured a war between two characters, one who chased money (and had symbolic affairs with Hollywood) and one who sought to be ""free"", but whose independence and desire for ""content"" and ""substance"", like a certain Preston Sturges hero, leads inevitably to his downfall.

""Haywire"" itself has the schizoid quality of ""Schizopolis"", at once pleased to be a conventional action movie and supremely ashamed of itself. This contradiction runs throughout all of Soderbergh's pictures. Beyond all this the film presents the ""female flip-side"" of Soderbergh's ""Magic Mike"", in much the same way that Soderbergh's ""whistleblower"" movies (""Informant"" and ""Erin Brokovich"") mirror each another. And so on this level both ""Mike"" (a film about male strippers) and ""Haywire"" are about a kind of equal opportunity objectification under capitalism: men and women are marketed to be looked at and old cinematic divides between the sexes (""passive"" women objectified by ""active"" men) have now been thoroughly eradicated. ""Haywire"" is itself self-consciously a product marketed for male consumers, whilst ""Mike's"" tailored for the ladies, complete with fetishized male bodies and swinging crotch luggage. But it's not only that capitalism reconfigures sex and bodies into exchangeable commodities (""life's a strip club"", ""everyone's a whore"" etc, old radical slogans which attempted to question what we think of as a benign provision of services), but that the very totems of genre (violence in ""Haywire's"" case, sex in ""Mike"") are being likened to pornography.

Unsurprisingly, ""Mike"", ""Haywire"" and ""Girlfriend"" are swathed in conversations about money and commerce. ""The motive is always money,"" characters in ""Haywire"" repeatedly state, in between dialogue about fee structures and insurance payments. The trio of films also feature similar narrative arcs, our leads all confronting their own self exploitation and disposability. ""Haywire's"" lead fights back, but ""Magic Mike's"" hero is beaten. He lives in happy self-denial, thinks of himself as a self-made man, an artist who ""works with his hands"", until he traumatically confronts his bondage. The film's tag-line is itself ""Work all day, work it all night"", epitomising a kind of all encompassing, blue-collar harlotry.

While designed as critique, the films' messages are somewhat compromised by their medium: they're also about the beauty of bodies in motion, the allure of sex, the rush of violence, the cinematic joys of watching good-looking people perform extraordinary physical feats etc. Soderbergh doesn't fight these contractions. This is a stark contrast to his more Kubrickian ""The Girlfriend Experience"", which was so unsexy it made your nauseous (Soderbergh's a vocal fan of Antonioni, Pasolini and Kubrick; he worked with Antonioni on one anthology and named his production company after ""Barry Lyndon"").

At least two of ""Haywire's"" action sequences are unique, the first a simple fist fight in a caf√©, the other a cool foot chase over and within buildings. Elsewhere the film's violence toward women is unusually frank. Casting a martial artist also allows Soderbergh to mimic Hong Kong action cinema, using wide shots and long takes rather that rapid-fire editing to impart the illusion of physicality. ""Haywire"" also has a certain cultivated ""flatness"" about it (machine-like, emotionless), again reminiscent of ""Schizopolis"", in which characters said stuff like ""generic greeting"" or ""generic greeting returned"", thereby calling attention to the triviality of much (movie) dialogue. If ""Haywire"" intends to use a similar ""flatness"" for similar reasons, it's largely pointless. Affectlessness and cool-distance have themselves become the style of most conventional action movies.

7.9/10 ‚Äì Worth one viewing.

Permalink",False,"Before writing my review for this movie, I tried to document myself a little about the main actress, Gina Carano, since I knew nothing about her, and because when watching her in action in all those fights and jumps from building to building I realized she was the real thing, nobody else was doing this fantastic superwoman heroics.

So, after seeing her making rear naked chokes, impressive overhand right and lefts and rib cracking hard kicks I knew she was a sort of a champion or something --I confirmed that later when I read her full biography and she's really out of this world, a true champion of Muay Thai, something I'm leaving up to you to find out what's that about.

Besides all those fights and runs through European city streets, this film doesn't offer any opportunities for acting, so we do not get to know anything about her acting abilities (for that matter for nobody else's in the whole casting, including the well known names).

Very bad movie.

No script whatsoever to follow intelligently, since there is nothing there to follow, just a sort of nicely photographed locations, interiors and close ups of her beautiful face and a few others to convey... well, to convey nothing really."

Permalink",False,"Haywire has style, almost too much style. Since it is a Steven Soderbergh film, a certain amount of gloss and creative camera shots are expected, but Haywire has more gloss and polish than average. It also has in-your-face brutal violence. There are relatively few firearms; the violence is one-on-one mortal combat to the death between somewhat evenly matched opponents, even though one of the fighters is a woman. It's The Limey with extended camera sequences and an absolutely gorgeous protagonist.

Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is a private contractor with a particular set of lethal skills. You hire her to rescue hostages, take down gangs, etc¬Ö Her boss and ex-boyfriend, always a good combination, is Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) who sets up her missions. Their firm is hired by Alex Coblenz (Michael Douglas) who represents some nameless government agency and a State Department functionary with a very fuzzy role in all of this is Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas).

It does not really matter who works for who or exactly how each piece of the confusing plot puzzle is set up, the film focuses in close-up on Mallory and her quest to not only survive, but to achieve revenge. Mallory is being set up for murder. We do not know why but somebody wants her out of the picture. Is it Kenneth, Rodrigo, or Alex? Maybe it is even one of her co-workers, perhaps the physically capable but not so bright Aaron (Channing Tatum) or the suave Paul (Michael Fassbender). Figuring out who the puppet master is behind the curtain is also a small sub-plot; let's get back to Mallory.

Gina Carano shows zero emotion on her face, even after she head butts enemies, breaks vases on their heads, and chokes them out with her legs. In real life, she was a professional Muay Thai fighter before switching to acting. She was cast in the TV show American Gladiators, not the game show but the scripted one, which is where Soderbergh saw her. Screenwriter Lem Dobbs, who worked with Soderbergh previously on The Limey and Kafka, wrote the script specifically for Carano and I imagine the rest of the A-list cast raised their hands to join because they wanted to work with one of the best directors in the business. Douglas is back again after starring in Soderbergh's Traffic.

Soderbergh made some very specific and very effective choices in his version of a straight up action thriller. The shots are much longer than the standard blink and you miss a jump-cut editing style for fight scenes. Mallory is shown in what seems like minute long takes walking down the street detecting surveillance on her or driving a vehicle in reverse very fast. Audiences have been taught to expect quick second long edits during chase and fight scenes which make them appear faster and more hectic. Not in Haywire. The fight scenes are uninterrupted and gruesome slug-fests. The characters actually bleed and stumble around as they would in a real fight.

I also noticed the music and sound effects, or lack of them. Regular actions films tend to pump up the volume during chases and flying fists. Soderbergh turned the music off. The audience only hears grunts, fists colliding with jaws, and painful groans when they connect. When firearms go off, it actually sounds like a pistol shot instead of a tremendous explosion. I found myself really enjoying this minimalist and reality-based version of action scenes.

Steven Soderbergh has crafted a very different action film than audiences are used to here. This most likely hurt the box office in the end, but bravo to the man for attempting to show a truer, and more intense, version of what bodies go through during fights. The plot is immediately forgetful and secondary to the thrill of watching an extremely dedicated and talented female action hero go after the bad guys. Sit back and enjoy the ride."

Permalink",False,"Gina Carano can hit dudes in the face. Very well in fact. When she connects her chosen limb to said dude's face, the reason for the film's existence is apparent. Every blow she lands looks great, every blow she receives looks great. What she does not know how to do is carry a film as a protagonist. So with this, I have to wonder, why this is the activity she is mainly doing throughout the picture. Not that her acting is absolutely terrible. It's not bad in fact. To me it just seems a terrific waste to mess around with things like plot and character development, when you have a fully experienced MMA fighter on your cast list. Meaning I wanted more of Gina punching Fassbender (who did a great job by the way) in the face and less of an attempt to craft a narrative.

A good example of this sentiment I suppose is the 2012 film The Raid. A film that has lots of guys hitting each other and no plot of characterisation to speak of. Its all the better for it too.

Permalink",False,"I was a little conflicted about seeing Haywire, mainly due to the fact it was an unusual spy thriller with a female lead. I was pleasantly surprised, though, and found the whole film to be entertaining and even realistic.

There is a good cast featured, although many have surprisingly small roles with not much dialogue. The film mainly took my interest by choosing Dublin for a majority of their action to take place. That hardly screams Hollywood action thriller. Even the script steered clear of Hollywood stereotype, and by choosing a female lead they managed to make the concept original and intriguing.

There are a few good action scenes, although the hand-to-hand combat is limited, excluding a brilliant action scene with our very own Michael Fassbender. There are little twists in this film, with the baddie being made apparent from the onset, and the major twist held little surprise for me, as I doubt it did most viewers. The plot is predictable, but surprisingly enjoyable and I didn't bore of the film, despite the lack of action. It helps that Gina Carano is actually a likable, kick-ass heroine, whereas most of Hollywood's choices are irritating for women dragged along to actions with their boyfriends. Although I wouldn't purchase this film, I would definitely watch it again were it to be aired on TV."

Permalink",True,"1) I am not an admirer of acclaimed, big-name Hollywood director Steven Soderbergh; however, I have long admired female mixed martial arts sensation Gina Carano (I'm a guy, so I'm allowed to have a crush on her - so what, you got a problem with that?), making her big-screen acting debut here in the 2011 martial arts action flick ""Haywire"" as an ex-Marine-turned-government-contractor who is forced to go on the run to clear her name after a botched job in Barcelona, Spain.

2) How or why she was set up are unimportant to the overall plot (something about Kane's rescue of a kidnapped Chinese journalist who had been writing a series of articles exposing the crimes of a well-connected Irish businessman, or something similar). Scenes of ""acting"" and people standing around talking only exist to provide a thread tying together fight scenes of Carano's Mallory Kane out-punching, out-kicking, out-strangling, and many times out-gunning the assorted hit-men and other paid stock baddies in her way.

3) Many of these other baddies include two one-time lovers - her ultra-shady ex-boss Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) and a fellow government agent, Aaron (Channing Tatum). Both of these two are able to hold their own fair enough, but, ultimately, are no match for Mallory Kane's expert Marine training. Another is a smooth-talking MI6 agent named Paul (Michael Fassbender).

4) Mallory's flight to clear her name takes her from Barcelona, to Ireland, New York, San Diego, New Mexico, and finally Majorca.

5) In most action movies these days, fight sequences are so quickly edited that they hardly make any sense and you can't tell what's going on.

6) This is not so with ""Haywire."" Soderbergh stages some excellent, hard-hitting fight sequences that make full use of Carano's MMA training and amazing physicality. Most importantly, her fight scenes unfold merely as images and with little sound, bass-thumping techno music, or dialogue. You're actually able to make out all the moves and hard-hitting action.

7) It is apparent that Carano did all of her own fights and stunts in this movie. One sequence features a daring chase through an apartment building that escalates with Carano's character having to jump from rooftop to rooftop to evade her would-be captors. She grunts, she sweats, and actually looks like she's getting tired from the pursuit. (I can see her being the new Lara Croft in a reboot of the ""Tomb Raider"" franchise, especially if it's based on the new ""Tomb Raider"" reboot video game that's due out soon.)

8) Gina Carano isn't really much of an actress, despite a few dramatic scenes (like with her dad, John, played by the always-reliable Bill Paxton). But she remains an intensely fierce presence on-screen. (The only drawback was what they did with digitally altering her voice. Why the hell did they do that? I guess she sounded too feminine? Too sweet? Do I dare say, ""innocent""?) Another thing is, the movie also does not make an issue of the fact that she's a woman (except maybe for one or two stray comments here and there), since many times her opponents are all men, and none of them go easy on her because she's a female. She takes more than a few licks of her own during her adventures, but always comes out on top (she has to, she's the star of the show). In other words, don't let her looks fool you: she may be a cutie, but she'll kick your a** between your shoulder blades twice before you know what hit you.

9) Soderbergh has scoured the ""B""-movie action movie circuit for his latest. In a genre that has been relegated to the likes of faded Hollywood action stars like Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Wesley Snipes (nothing against any of them, since I admire many of their individual action flicks), Soderbergh injects a fierce shot of adrenalin - namely a huge budget and big-name stars - into a well-worn cinematic clich√©.

10) I guess that even big-name Hollywood hot-shots get to a point in their careers where they can do whatever they want and nobody can say anything about it. But I admire what Steven Soderbergh did with a movie that has an intentionally lackadaisical script (by long-time collaborator Lem Dobbs). I will not fault the material because that's pointless at this juncture. It's what's been done with it that's important, and how it's ultimately handled by the filmmakers.

11) ""Haywire"" is a unique, fun new spin on a well-worn movie idea. It's hardly groundbreaking, but it will hopefully lead to a wonderful career for its beautiful star outside The Octagon.

12) 6/10

Permalink",False,"This film has no connection with the 1980 film HAYWIRE with Lee Remick which deals with the life of the actress Margaret Sullavan.

There is no plot to speak of, and some of the dialogue is inaudible due to mumbling. But no one seems to worry about whether we understand who is killing whom or why, as the motto seems to be: 'Action does not think, it does.' The lead is the actress Gina Carano, who has done a lot of martial arts training and knows how to dig her elbow powerfully into men's faces. Don't try and figure it out. Don't even bother to see it.

Permalink",False,"Okay,

I thought the movie was okay. Nothing too memorable, but nothing horrible either. The soundtrack was kinda funny, it had an 80's cop show feeling to it.

I think what bothered most people is that with big names like Antonio Banderas (who was only really a small part), Ewan MacGregor, and Channing Tatum, that certain expectations from prior movies (they played in) were created.

I don't really think you can judge against the movie for what it wasn't trying to do.... It's really Hollywood and big budget directors that set up a certain standard/expectation and given the plot, I'm sure a lot of guys out there felt a bit cheated.

I enjoyed a woman playing the main black ops role. Especially someone as attractive as that. I think I went into this movie wanting to watch an attractive woman who could be fit and beat the crap out of a lot of guys. A male fantasy thing, I guess.

Why people kept on bringing up Bourne is beyond me. I don't see how people can claim it to be anything like each other. Honestly I think Hollywood just goes overkill on the action, the violence, the spectacular catastrophe, that something a bit more 'real' seems like a let-down. It's not so much adrenaline pumping (like Bourne is), as it is cerebral - more of watching to see how well she can get out of this situation. I'm sorry guys if it wasn't as 'fun' as what you were all expecting, but that's not the movie's fault. It's a lot more serious and, well, dry, than anything out there on the big screen, but nonetheless it wasn't that bad.

There wasn't much emotion from the female lead, which I think is probably realistic given the type of person we're talking about, with that line of work. I somewhat expected the quietness, pensiveness, of the lead actress - someone always skeptical about what's happening around her.

I suppose some men out there were perhaps disappointed that the lead actress wasn't portraying more of a sexy character, like Lara Croft, etc but, again, this is more realistic than that. The type of women who go into the marines, special forces, etc aren't into scantily clad clothing, dresses, or being overtly sexual. Just think about what kind of personality it takes to want to be in the military."

Permalink",False,"This film is about a female secret agent who finds out that her employers want her dead.

""Haywire"" is a typical spy thriller, with a lot of action, running away, then more action. Even though there are a lot of big name actors in the film, it is really a one woman show. Gina Carano's action sequences are impressive, and it almost feels as if ""Haywire"" was made to exclusively showcase her martial arts skills.

Putting that aside, the film is confusing at first, especially with the flashbacks and fragmented story telling. Towards the middle, as the pieces fall together, the plot becomes clear. The story becomes less surprising and more predictable, and hence losing the wow factor.

""Haywire"" is still an enjoyable spy thriller, with great action scenes.

Permalink",False,"Mercenary contract worker and spy Mallory (Gina Carano) goes on a mission, is betrayed and the rest of the film is her running to or from the Good Guys or the Bad Guys because you won't be able to tell the good from the bad and she can't either. She is scared and trusts no one.

One reason no one can tell the good guys from the bad ones is because they all seem to look alike. And, I am not talking about Antonio Bandaras' character or Michael Douglas' character. They don't confuse you because you know what they look like, but you are still not sure if one or both of them are good or bad. The darkened scenes help with this confusion and they go by quickly.

Most of the movie is Mallory running on foot and no racing vehicles CGI here. (Gina Carano spent a lot of time working out for this movie and she wants to make sure you see the results. Actually, not bad. Kudos.) Mallory doesn't know if she is doing the right thing; and, of course, you don't either but you stay with her because you know she is the only good guy (gal) in here. The editing for these runs is very good. Reminded me of Enemy of the State, the standard I use.

If Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas had more screen time, this could have been a major movie, but they didn't. What they had was good, but we wanted more.

Not much face time in here and don't expect things to slow down so you can figure all this out. You may figure all this out with the last few scenes. Maybe.

By the end of the movie you will either be satisfied or not. Will we see a sequel in this arena or another Laura Croft? I am ready for either one. (6/10)

Permalink",False,"I saw this movie yesterday because I wanted to see The Artist, but the theater that I went to didn't have it. You may be thinking, ""oh this guy wanted to see the artist, which means he is really artsy anyway, so that's why he didn't like it."" Well, let me assure you that I'm not. I enjoy action movies as much as the next person. Because of the cast and the concept, and the fact that it was directed by Steven Soderbergh, I thought it was going to be pretty good or at least decent. It wasn't. It was awful.

I was bored to the point of almost leaving the theater. There are plenty of scenes that just drag on for 3 to 4 minutes, while tacky heist music is playing in the background. And they don't accomplish anything. There's not much dialogue, and when there is, the acting is awful, which is not something I expected out of this group.

The plot is just dumb. It is essentially a ""highly trained agent gone rogue because she was betrayed"" deal and it makes the film very boring and predictable.

So far, I've seen a lot of people give the movie credit for its action sequences. I completely disagree. Every action scene is Gina Carano in a hand-to-hand battle with someone else. This is how almost every action scene goes: The guy hits her, she ducks or evades his strike, and then hits him. Then he hits her back and seems to be in the dominant position, but then she gets out of his hold and somehow puts him in a choke hold and kills him. While that may not be every action sequence, that happened like 4 times in the movie, which made it seem very unrealistic. I think if a 200-250 pound guy was on top of a 120-150 pound woman, choking her to death, she would have a very hard time getting out of that situation. But that's not how it works in Haywire.

Overall, this movie just left me very unsatisfied. It seemed like it was 4 hours long, and I honestly don't know why i didn't leave halfway through. I didn't learn anything new about anything by staying for the rest of it. Please don't waste your time on this garbage."

Permalink",False,"Absolute drivel. Everyone involved in the film should be slapped and sent to bed early without their tea. Please spend your time watching something else. If you much watch it look out for the tumbleweed, it was totally the highlight for me.

The acting is weak, the plot in disarray and, as another reviewer has already stated, the film just ends with no explanation or conclusion. Not like a French film ending, it just stops as it the director had something better to do than finish the final scene.

An embarrassment to the genre. With the caliber of the cast I had expected much more. I've watched many terrible films before, but this is the first that has motivated me to get an IMDb account and write a review to warn others!

Permalink",False,"I rarely write reviews of movies on here, but I had to in this case. First off, let me say that, as far as action movies are concerned, I'm one of the least picky people on Earth, especially when it comes to plot and story.

I actually heard there are some people who think this movie is a work of art. I about died laughing when I heard that. I suppose it could be considered that, in the same way that a random splotch of pain thrown down on a canvas would be considered art to someone, somewhere.

What's amazing about this movie is how quickly it turns you off. Within minutes of the movie you aren't really sure what's going on, and you simply don't care. NONE of the characters are interesting or likable. The fight scenes are decent at times and pretty bad at times. They often seem very staged and choreographed, and the lame camera work and extremely poor sound effects take away much of the impact the scenes could have.

I rarely notice people's bad acting, but the main character's (Carrano) acting is just bad. Lastly, the music is very strange through the whole movie. There are times when it doesn't have music for long stretches, and when it does have music it seems cheesy and out of place for the movie.

In short, this movie tries to be a slick spy-thriller like The Bourne Identity but fails laughably and miserably. Considering the number of big-name actors it had, this was a monumental failure."

Permalink",False,"Even from the first 10 minutes I knew this wasn't something worth watching but hoped to get engaged in the plot at one point. Never happened: Spy gone rogue, gone bad-ass and gone in the search for truth and revenge. We've got enough of those, only better.

The ONLY enjoyable scenes are the choreographed fighting acts. Other than that it's corny dialogue (dialogue being a rare occurrence here), unclear events (or justifications for them)and bad, forced acting.

Almost disappointing to see Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas here.

The absolute worst thing about this movie is the fact that there is no character building. Towards the end of it you don't care if anyone dies or gets caught or what else. You just want it to be over with!

Permalink",False,"I am not sure if Gina Butch Carano is related to some one with money, has an uncle in the movie business maybe? As this film has lots of actors in it you would not mind at all helping you out kick starting your Hollywood career.

Gina does a good overall job at acting, sure it feels a bit wooden at times, but the solid story line, great cast, and yes lots of bare knuckle fighting made this OK to watch.

No I am not going to say it will set the world on fire, but the film was very watch-able, it had that cheap B grade feeling at times, nothing really new story line wise, but worthy of a score of 7 out of 10.

Permalink",True,"I haven't watched a good action movie for a long time. So when the Haywire trailer came out, it was natural that I got excited waiting for the premiere of the movie. After a few weeks playing in Cinema 21, I finally watched the movie.

Now, why did I get excited?

Because most of the actors are famously talented people with ample experience in the acting world. Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Bill Paxton, Michael Fassbender. Other than that, Gina Carrano as the lead actress is clamored as the new generation femme fatale.

Anyway, do I recommend this movie?

If you're like me, no.

I do love action movies but when I watch action movies, I find that emotion is a necessary appendage to action movies. If there is none, I find it rather boring. Lack of juice, so to say. Haywire is like that. It is fortunate that the fighting sequence is really 'bad-ass'. Gina Carrano, as the female agent who got double crossed by her previous lover/employer, delivered revenge in a quite 'ouch-that-hurts' kind of way. Watching those gorgeous faces got beaten up by Gina is somewhat satisfying. But the lead actress is lacking in emotion and there is absolutely almost no chemistry between the characters in the movies. As if everyone had a role and played it solo on the stage. There was no connection. No emotional bonding. Eventually, no matter how great the action was, it bored me.

It was unfortunate, really. I would love to recommend this movie. If you are really into action movies and do not care what the story is, Haywire is your movie. But if you want to get an understanding of the movie, character's backgrounds, and la-la-la, please save your time and look for a Jackie Chan movie. (Yes, I love Jackie Chan movie - and he does his own stunts too!)

However, it will not be fair if we judge Gina Carrano as an incompetent actress. The actors have their own faults too. Now, since the action sequence is pretty good, I suppose there will be more of her movies in the future. You see, because when you see her beating the hell out of her fellow colleagues, I find myself saying: ""Oh, sh*t!"".

Permalink",False,"Simultaneously premiering here in the UAE, viewers are going to be spoilt for choice between ""Haywire"" and ""War Horse"". ss versus SS. Steven Soderbergh versus Steven Spielberg. David versus Goliath. Opposite Spielberg, Soderbergh may appear to be the underdog, and as we know, everyone loves the underdog. However, this time around I am not so sure.

The plot is fairly simple with covert agent Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) accepting a 'light' job where she must pose as the wife of a British agent, simply known as Paul (Michael Fassbender). Arriving in Dublin, Mallory finds her contact murdered; the same person she helped rescue as a hostage just a week before. Her suspicions of being double crossed and framed are confirmed when she is attacked and nearly killed by Paul. Back in the United States, Mallory contacts agency head Coblenz (Michael Douglas) who suspects her former lover Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) of being a rogue agent. Mallory must now settle the score once and for all and heads toward a showdown in Mexico.

Seen this movie before? Sure you have. Instead of Jason Bourne, we have a female lead. How many times before have we seen a Special Ops agent who gets double crossed, then does a U-turn hell bent on revenge? Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill"". Angelina Jolie in ""Salt"". Zoe Saldana in ""Columbiana"" and the list goes on. On top of that, there is a lot of praise for Carano doing her own stunts. Why is that so surprising when middle-aged Tom Cruise did his own stunts outside the world's tallest building? Then again, the difference between Carano and someone like Thurman or Saldana is that the latter two are actors, whereas Carano is a former MMA fighter whose idea of acting has a lot of 'my-foot-in-your-face' attitude.

I am not saying that this movie is a waste of time. All I'm saying is that coming from someone like Soderbergh, you would expect an edge-of-your-seat movie experience. Like ""Contagion"" and the ""Oceans"" franchise before, you can expect Soderbergh's hallmark plethora of A-listers in supporting roles. Having said that, shouldn't the leading actor be as good or better than the supporting cast? Carano does try, and I think she will make an excellent action movie star, but she needs the necessary exposure as a serious actor to match her skilled abilities in martial arts. If not, I'm afraid Carano could be treading the same path as martial artist and B-movie actress Cynthia Rothrock. The remaining stars perform as expected with some good antagonism from Fassbender and McGregor. Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas are in their own comfort zones without having to do much.

For an action movie, pacing is not too bad with some equally good fight choreography. Soderbergh could be testing uncharted waters here as this is his first movie with some brutal fight scenes. One particular scene has Mallory punched, kicked and thrown around like a stuffed toy owned by an evil little brat. Evidently, Soderbergh got it right with the fight scenes, because most other action scenes appears to be cut-copy-pasted, and comes with some of the clich√©s you would expect in a high end Hollywood action caper.

All in all, this is an average action thriller, but nothing we haven't seen before and definitely nothing to write home about."

Permalink",False,"Steven Soderbergh is responsible for some great films, known for their back and forth time lines. I found the Oceans three to be a breath of fresh air in the movie industry giving new meaning to the 'smash and grab'.

The female lead of Haywire, Gina Carano was someone I needed to Google in order to find out who she was, as she was an unknown. She was convincing as a female lead and I found her brilliant. She was believable and she was a woman. Unlike the Angelina Jolie's of this world she looked like she actually ate food as opposed to sniffing it, which as a woman who is bombarded with images of what we should look like all the time, was lovely.

From there however I do believe this film is not as great as it could have been. The bad guys were not bad enough, the fight scenes showed very little blood (I am not a gore hound however it just wasn't believable) and I must say it was not easy to follow as it just didn't seem to flow.

Not a waste of money but not great either."

The constant backdrop of music playing made it hard to focus. The music wasn't even good! Sounded like something you would hear in a film from the 70's. I believe there was a point when there was music with a side order of awkward sound effects. The sound effects were also lousy...The gun shots sounded like BB Guns LOL. The acting was not up to par as well. There were a few good action scenes but it just wasn't enough to keep me entertained. If I had known this ahead of time I wouldn't have wasted my $1.30 at the Redbox. All I can say is Thank God I didn't go to the movies to see this one. Don't waste your time OR money on this flop.

Permalink",False,"With Steven Soderbergh at helm for this movie, and a cast including renowned thespians Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Micheal Fassbender and Antonio Banderas, one could have expected much, much more.

No doubt, there were some good action sequences throughout the movie but most of the scenes (including the chase and creeping-behind-people- stupidly-and-trying-to-kill-them scenes) were just too moronic and needless to be watched even for the average movie-goer.

Gina Carano, making her debut as a female action didn't have what it takes to make the movie work, but it also could be due to the poor script of the never-ending, same old spy revenge plot crap. Her screen presence is somewhat distracting as she only mutters a few one-liners and kill guys with moves that I would deem awkward.

Overall, it was like a minimalist approach to making a action movie that didn't work at all. Now if you would excuse me, I need to delete all the memory of this movie in my mind."

Permalink",True,"Though I had decided not to write reviews on IMDb anymore, this movie was so bad that I had to write this for the sake of poor fans who love action thrillers. I am not a person who decides to see a movie randomly. I consider several factors before seeing a one. Here the reasons I chose to see this movie were mainly,1.the interesting plot summary(Bourne-like),2.cast filled with several A-list actors,3.IMDB rating of 6.3.(After seeing the movie I found out Rotten Tomato critics' rate was 80%) So everything was set for a thrilling ride. But on the halfway, it was clear that I had been cheated like. This movie was a disaster.It was very slow and for about half of the movie we have to see the main actress walks or runs fanatically here and there being chased by someone, running up and down staircases which was frustratingly long and boring. Every now and then she hits a guy which are shown in a very dull way. There were several pretty stupid incident like the main actress telling her whole somewhat classified story to a total stranger asking him to memorize whole thing which ultimately does not lead to anything. From the beginning, the story is presented in a confusing way leading us to think there is going to be some masterful twist or something in the end. However, at the end it appears that virtually no storyline there. In fact, incredibly stupid story makes it so funny at the end. Please do not waste your valuable time for this crap. P.S. - Rotten tomato viewer's rating was 40% ,something which should be more or less correct compared to critics.

The fight/action scenes were bland, the story line lacked any cohesiveness or passion, the acting was horribly directed and 2 dimensional, with no light and shade, emotion, tension, fear or excitement and the lead... well... I found it very difficult recognising Gina Carano as a women. My eyes were saying ""that's not a girl"" but my head was saying ""you're mistaken, she IS a woman"". Gina is a very masculine looking woman and she was filmed from very unkind angles! BUT asides from looks, her acting is atrocious, although she'd be an amazing stunt woman! I would not recommend this film to anyone.... Unless you're a huge fan of diabolically bland and pointless film making, then... Go for it... only don't pay for it!!

this movie never provided us with any possible, probable, believable logic or premises but only gave us a pretty face and body that could turn lethal anytime when she was cluelessly set up without any probable cause or reasons.

and worst of all, a bad screenplay ended up with a lousy director short of the basic logic training."

Permalink",False,"If you expected ""Haywire"" to be a cheesy action film designed to capitalize on Gina Carano in provocative outfits you'd be disappointed. Academy Award winner Steven Soderbergh is far too good a director for that and what we have here is a well crafted vehicle for Carano to display her martial arts expertise. When she's not dispatching foes as an agent for an unscrupulous private contractor, her character Mallory Kane, maintains a wary attitude towards strangers. The only person she trusts is her father, an author of war novels, played by Bill Paxton. The plot may be standard deja vu action genre stuff but ""Haywire"" can boast a far better cast than you typically see. Michael Douglas is a government agent who wants Mallory to help him uncover a traitor in the organization. Ewan McGregor and Channing Tatum are Mallory's boss and former partner respectively. Michael Fassbender is an agent who Mallory thinks has been brought in to work on a mission with her. Antonio Banderas is a shadowy operative working with the government. ""Haywire"" looks and feels like an Indie film. It's structured like a standard Hollywood actioner but it wants to possess an authenticity a big Hollywood production would find too restrictive. Gina Carano obviously doesn't have a lot of acting chops yet so don't go expecting Angelina Jolie in ""Salt"". Overall I found it an entertaining hour and a half."

Permalink",True,"I just watched it on the big screen. It's pretty BAD. It's pretty much no talk, just some random lines. The actress is apparently poor and therefore they tried to avoid speaking and do more of playing. But that didn't come good too. There are some scenes that are just there to increase runtime. When i think about it, there are a lot of scenes that are there for that. I haven't seen so many people leave the saloon before, way before the end, since ""The American"". Well you could compare it to ""The American"" in number of lines, do not know what is happening, why it is happening, is it gonna happen something at last.

The fighting is good enough, but that is it.

At some point you understand that the heroin is doing her job to the end, and she is leaving no loose ends. At least that was the idea. But after you see that if you think back you will see that she is running from her problems, not trying to resolve them. So even the story has its faults.

The major actors have secondary roles and can not help the movie in any case. It's just an idea gone wrong. That's what it is.

It was 90mins of hope that at some point something will happen and you could lift your eyes from the watch. You could see that money have been spend on the making of the movie but why, no one knows. It's like they made something worth half as much.

Forget about the money, money can be earned, do not waste your time.

Permalink",False,"Haywire (2011)

** (out of 4)

Gina Carano plays a black ops soldier who is double crossed by her agency so she sets out to find out who sold her out and why. HAYWIRE got released to very little noise but on its opening weekend things heated up as people left the theater extremely unhappy with what they watched. I've never really understood these ""CinemaScore"" groups as they always appear to give films low ratings if the films don't deliver on their expectations. Director Steven Soderbergh clearly wanted to do an experimental action movie and I will admit that this is unlike any other action movie out there. With that said, while I can appreciate Soderbergh wanted to try something new and experimental, that doesn't mean it was a success. I think there are some interesting ideas floating around in this film but in the end I just found it to be rather dull, lifeless and without a bit of energy. The movie seems to want to be something that Jean-Luc Godard would direct had he been given an action script. The movie features very bizarre camera angles, strange fight sequences and a really, really strange music score that seems to deliver the same notes no matter what type of emotion a scene is meant to have. These strange directorial changes make for a unique and original experience but it really does seem as Soderbergh went overboard on the style while not delivering any substance. The biggest problem is that the story is so one-note that it's really hard to care about the lead or worry about who set her up. Another problem is that all of the all-star cast members are pretty much wasted in thankless roles. Names like Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Channing Tatum, Bill Paxton and Michael Fassbender signed onto the picture and I'm guessing mainly as a favor to the director. This was my first time seeing Carano in anything. She doesn't give a ""good"" performance but she can act the part as the tough action hero just fine. HAYWIRE, without any doubt, is an experiment that had a few good ideas but in the end they just never added up to anything."

The actress is no actress and when she replied to her ""boss"" in the movie that she was to serve as ""eye candy"", I thought what blind person would consider her hot? She ain't no Kate Beckinsale, Angelina Jolie, Linda Hamilton, Uma Thurman, Darryl Hannah or even Linda Carter. I've kicked better looking broads out of bed for eating crackers. She acts like she is made of cardboard or wood. She needs to stay in the MMA ring. She is out of her element and ability in a movie. Ewan McGregor is excellent as always, a treat to watch.

Permalink",False,"I need to say after seeing the trailer for this film I wasn't expecting a lot but I looked at the cast and the fact Steven Soderbergh directed it and convinced myself to go and check it out. I must state again that after seeing the trailer I wasn't expecting much, and what I got was a whole lot worse! It was simply horrendous! The only reason I gave this film any stars at all is because of the cast and the fact I couldn't do any better (Although the challenge has been accepted). Just a terrible story, terrible direction, heck even the acting wasn't that good! After this film I left the theater in awe of what I just paid money for, a couple held the door for me on my way out and I heard the woman utter, ""Well that's two hours of my life that I will never get back"", and I can't help but agree with her.

Permalink",False,"Soderbergh's take on the 'Bourne genre'; it's simple as that. However, I must say, this movie seems like it does not know what it wants to be.

Even as a big fan of Steven Soderbergh, Haywire comes across to me as an unsatisfactory piece. I think the main problem is that the characters- all of them- are not interesting enough to care for. I hate to say it, but Malory Cane is one of the blandest protagonists I've ever seen recently- especially in the area of the 'Bourne genre'.

That's not to say that there was anything wrong with Gina Carano's performance. She gives an appropriate amount of weight to the character, as well as to the over-all atmosphere and tone. So I say Malory Cane is just a badly written character.

Speaking of characters, it feels like the element of huge ensemble of cast has become sort of a trademark for Steven Soderbergh movies. However, I honestly never saw it as a flaw until this film.

Even in the Ocean's series where there are, always, at least eleven main characters(which is a nightmare for writers/directors to develop and portray properly), all of the characters had unique, genuine, and interesting aspects, as the mix with big number of big actors always turned out as great synergy effect.

In fact, the 'huge cast' element even worked fantastically in last year's ""Contagion (2011)"", even when that film was a ""story with out a drama"" type of movie. It was great. I loved it.

However, Haywire suffers as the all big actors fail to cover the lack of 'live characters interacting' with each other, to the point where:

Soderbergh-style cinematography, some actually very impressive fight choreography, delicate touch in staging the actors with making seemingly ordinary locations look beautiful, intelligent dry humor,

...all fail to cover-up for the lack of density the film has to offer.

the actors were- surprisingly- not utilized very well, the characters were forgettable, there was very little suspense throughout the movie, it wasn't funny, it wasn't serious,

and it just wasn't entertaining enough.

For people who are not familiar with Steven Soderbergh movies, it's a slow-paced action movie that's shot beautifully... but that's about it.

Oh, also, I think for this one instance, David Holmes' music did not work for the movie. That doesn't help much either."

Permalink",True,"I expected more from a Steven Soderbergh film. With all that they built up in the previews about how great this film is, and it did look a bit interesting from the previews, it's a major let down.

First of all, the main character is played by Gina Carano, a former ""GLADIATOR"" on ""American Gladiators""! If I had known that going in, I would have never saw this movie. That woman needs some acting lessons. The story and plot of the movie was confusing, and not in a good way. You don't feel anything for the characters. You really don't give a crap if Mallory lives or dies. To see such horrible performances out of people like Antonio Banderas and Ewan McGregor.

I'm not going into much detail in the movie, just the plot and story are silly, Gina Carano is horrible, and I just lost 2 hours of my life on this crap. I think if this hadn't been a Soderbergh film, I may have been nicer, but dang, he put his name to this.

Permalink",False,"I had to write a review here, because of the many 0 and 1 reviews that were just unfair, to the point where I wonder if some of those people are brainwashed. First, to all the people saying the fights didn't look real : are you kidding me ? They were way above most fights on any actions movies out there, it sounds like you people are so much used to unreal Hollywood choreographed fights that it became the standard for reality in your minds. Those fights were raw, violent and efficient. Nothing stylish in it, she is not dancing, she is protecting herself with real moves. And this is one of the few positive points of this movie.

Secondly, she sure has to improve her acting skills, but come on people, she still acts better than Kirsten Stewarts and yet the later one is considered as an actress, when miss Carano is just starting her carrier. She is quite good looking, she actually looks like a normal person, not an anorexic Hollywood freak and she definitely fits her character. I'd definitely like to see her in movies with a good, real scenario.

Regarding the film itself, well, the scenario is weak as well as the dialogs. Revealing the intrigue at the end doesn't work, because, and I agree here with what other people say, it is hard to follow the story as there isn't any until the end. It does feel like random scenes following each other with no apparent reason. But blame Soderbergh, not the actors. Overall, I'd give this movie a 5, for the fights, the familiar faces (McGregor, Douglas...) and miss Carano who has potential, and should be given a chance. But I gave an 8 to compensate all those foolish comments about realism in fights and Carano's acting skills."

Terrible chase and fight scenes, which in the most part were pretty boring. At one point the main character just walks down the street being followed for a couple of minutes with literally nothing happening. Watch it just to see how bad it is, but only if you can see it for free. If I could give zero stars then I would have, please don't pay money to watch this steaming pile of crap

People complained about the acting, directing, plot, even the music! And yet I doubt most if any could act any better, write scripts any better, or really know a thing about directing a film. All right it wasn't the best Oscar winning epic, but neither was it the worst by far. I have sat through/fallen asleep during many other films that are far worse than Haywire. You should see it for what it is, 90 minutes of fun where you get to see a good looking girl kick some ass, and you shouldn't take it too seriously. If you want to see some mindless movie where there are explosions and death every ten seconds, then see something else. The film was a snapshot, a sequence of events that had no real beginning or conclusion - it left that up to the imagination of the viewer. It is so easy to be an armchair critic, anyone can do it. But to act, write and direct takes courage and to all those who love to pull people down, I say get up there and see if you can do any better, and we'll all have a laugh. This is coming from someone who's a drama graduate and has done acting, writing and directing, and it ain't easy. This film was good and I would recommend it to anyone who like the action/thriller genre."

Permalink",True,"For the size of a film filled with Hollywood's top stars, I must admit this film is disappointing. The dialogue is flat and boring, and lack of recognition of roles and characters makes the audience do not get the depth of this film. I almost fell asleep in every dialogue scene.

Gina Carano can do martial art, but she obviously can not act. I can not understand why the producers and director chose her as the lead role. There are many actresses who can do action scenes but can still make a convincing acting (milla jovovich or kate beckinsale just to show a few).

In terms of film technique, the lighting is very poor. many indoor scenes looked dim and unattractive because of the lack of variations in lighting. whether the lighting department was lazy to set the lights or it was deliberately made that way. even a dark movie like underworld trilogy can show a perfect lighting technique.

cinematography also looks like an amateur. looked like there was only one camera used throughout the film. It rarely moves, no multiple angle shot and stays with the same position. For an action movie, it makes the movie boring and less bite. There are also many scenes which I think should have been cut, but still continued without any dialog that make the actors/actres looked confused to improvise.

Of all the actors in this film, i think only michael douglas showed his class even though not much scenes with him.

I really do not understand what Steven Soderbergh was thinking. He didn't look like serious doing this film. I mean, look at Erin Brokovich, Traffic, Ocean's trilogy... Haywire definitely looks like a failed experiment.

Permalink",False,"Haywire is far better than your average action movie. So why the disappointing box office turnout? This may seem like a disgustingly simple explanation but here goes anyway. Who is this film for? Die hard action film fans? That's MEN by the way. Of course it is! Right? It stars Gina Carrano - MMA Goddess! Carrano is backed by an all-star cast to boot. If it were true that a movie with a female action star was that appealing to male action movie fans then the $$$ would reflect that. But it doesn't. So does this appeal to women? Women want to see a strong attractive woman be a hero and save the day don't they? Well... no they don't. There's a reason chick flicks are generally devoid of martial arts and explosions. So is ""Haywire"" a date movie? No. I'm sorry if that sounds sexist but who wants to have that awkward ""you thought she was prettier than me"" conversation? Yeah that's right somebody's gotta say it. It's a gender issue. Sure there have been plenty of successful action movies with female leads but this is different in that Carrano's toughness is masculine toughness and we're not ready to be sold that. Maybe if woman's MMA really catches on this will start to change. It'll certainly have to make it to the UFC first. At its best this film could be the first step toward deconstructing gender roles in a new way."

It was hard to follow, im not really sure just why the betrayed her, not really a spoiler, it was in the trailers but i thought id be safe. There was a handful of scenes where it was OK, when they were fighting for example. But, in my opinion, not a very well directed movie. The continuum of the storyline didn't transition well, there wasn't really any flow to it, and it just all around was't well executed. I suppose the acting from some members of the cast were alright but that is im not giving this movie a 1. Readers, I wouldn't bother watching this movie.

Permalink",True,"Being an avid MMA fan when I got word that Gina Carano would be transitioning to acting, Haywire was definitely on my checklist. For her first film it went surprisingly well. A plot that although starts off very sketchy in detail slowly unravels itself in 15 minute intervals. In many ways it wasn't too fictional of a role considering the fact that this is a former champion. Think about it, a beautiful woman who kicks the crap out of various people for a fat paycheck. Not too shabby.

There's pretty descent action scenes as Tatum gets arm barred, Fassbender goes to sleep in a triangle joke and a random cop gets superman punched. All the correct elements were in place to make this an enjoyable 90 minutes; great supporting cast accompanied by a smooth soundtrack. Only thing i disliked was how half of the film's premise takes place via a conversation in a car as flashbacks of prior events are shown; but in hindsight that's neither here or there.

Permalink",False,"I loved this movie... I wasn't expecting much because of all the mixed reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised.

One thing to note is that the movie was shot in a kind of 70's style. This may turn people off because you don't see the over the top ""gloss"" that is associated with your typical Hollywood action movie. So it may come across as low budget, with odd music choices. However about halfway through I figured out that this is actually a throwback to some of the old 70's action/suspense/crime/spy films. The movie style, dialog, etc. A young Michael Caine or Sean Connery would fit right in here.

If you don't pick that up or appreciate this ""retro"" style, you're not going to like it. If you do then you're in for a treat and beautiful cinematography.

The action and choreography was fantastic... Not for being crazy and over the top, but for being INCREDIBLY realistic . This isn't your typical ""suspend your belief for a moment while a skinny Barbie chick throws a 300 pound man across the room with her finger"". No this looked and felt *real*... It wasn't until after the movie that I learned that the main actress was a former mixed martial arts fighter. I never got the sense that she was fighting beyond that of a real highly trained woman. This made me sympathize with the character much more.

The plot is simple and straightforward, but reveals a complex relationship between the characters.

If you're looking your typical over the top Hollywood action flick starring Lucy Liu, Bruce Willis, and featuring big explosions and high tech spy gear then skip it... You're not going to like it. If you're looking for an atypical action movie that's subtle in it's delivery and a true throwback to some of the pure, gritty and straight forward movies from the 70's then you won't be disappointed.

I'd LOVE to see a sequel or even a television series, but I doubt that will ever happen because people really didn't know what to make of this movie... Some people were expecting an action movie and got a ""film"", others were expecting great drama with hi profile actors, but instead got an action movie.

In reality Haywire is part action movie and part ""film"". This makes it very unique and rather odd at the same time. Action movies typically break ground through more special effects, however Haywire does the opposite by going ""retro"".

So if you are of those two minds you will love this movie. Otherwise you will just see it as falling short in either category."

Permalink",False,"I watched this last night and wondered who was playing the lead female role in this movie, I had never seen her before. So I googled it and came up with the name, Gina Carano. Still none the wiser I did a little more research and found out she is an ex pro-cage fighter and was on the TV show, American Gladiator. Ah, now I understand why she cannot act to save her life!

What on earth were a bunch of otherwise respected and talented people thinking when they cast her in this? She only has 2 facial expressions, one is a kind of smug smirk and the other is a completely blank 1000 yard stare.

The film is basically a waste of time, its a big budget all star vehicle for and actress who cannot act. But can she fight? Well, maybe she can, I have not seen any of here ""real life"" bouts but on the showing of this film she can't fight either. Perhaps that is not her fault, the fight scenes are so preposterously overplayed and unrealistic its difficult to take them seriously. They are brutal, for sure, but realistic, never. I don't care how tough you are but if you take several full on punches to the face from a big guy you are not going to get up in a hurry let alone get up without a scratch on you!!

So what is the movie supposed to be? The plot is thin, very thin indeed so we can't class it as a serious spy movie like ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"". Its not a glossy all action CGI action fest like the Mission Impossible franchise either. Its doesn't have the glamour and charm of a Bond tittle and neither does it have the gritty realism of the Bourne movies, though I suspect this is what they were aiming at more than anything else. Its simply a case of badly wasted talent. The only up side to the whole experience was that it was mercifully short.

But there is one ray of light at the end of the tunnel. Judging from the poor ratings it is receiving I doubt there will be a sequel."

Permalink",False,"Haywire was a much different movie than I was expecting. In a good way. Not to say there aren't weaknesses: the plot is contrived and the elevator-like music during the otherwise thrilling action sequences is absurd. Those give way to the tension in the chases followed by the brutal hand to hand combat sequences. Newcomer and retired MMA fighter Gina Carano more than holds her own in a cast littered with talent. She gets to kick some all star ass in a very convincing manner. The way she throws punches and kicks is different than the way a typical actor would. There are cool moves here and there, yet, it's not at all stylized.

The movie centers on Mallory Kane, a contract black ops agent who suddenly finds herself hunted by everyone she comes across ‚Äì seemingly like all thrillers of this sort. Unlike others in this genre, Mallory hasn't seemingly done anything to deserve this. We're never led to believe she knows too much or was too nosy. Many reviewers have called this an inferior version of the Bourne movies. I think it's better than all but the original Bourne, largely thanks to A-list director Steven Soderbergh. The comparisons beyond that are moot.

In many ways Haywire is a nonstop action film. There's terrific tension at all times because we know right from the beginning that Mallory is being hunted. There's nothing new about the ""show me the middle of the movie first"" structure, but it's hardly this well utilized. From her first uneasy meeting with Aaron (Channing Tatum in his best acting turn yet), we're in her shoes. We don't trust anyone. There is a particular long chase scene where Mallory is simply trying to get away from the scene by walking down the street. Her glances spot her tail across the way. She doesn't just start running. She continues walking and waits until she turns a corner and has the upper hand to break into a sprint. She's also not dumb enough to look back until she thinks she's in the clear.

That's what seems to separate Mallory and the rest of Haywire from lesser action thrillers. Mallory is smart. She knows when to snoop. She knows when to walk. She knows when she's in over her head and is more than willing to run instead of fight. Perhaps this is her first separation from her male protagonists that typically dominate the genre. She's patient, calculating. Is she a bad ass capable of taking out two swat officers at the same time? Sure, but she'll wait until she really has the advantage to do it.

In terms of more raw action, there are a few one-on-one fights with men where we never question if she can hold her own. None of the fights are the same. She faces adversaries that are either young and athletic, polished and professional, or more comfortable behind a desk. Thank God for once the desk job guy doesn't have some secret fighting ability that he's been hiding the entire time for some reason. Her friends and foes are played by the likes of Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor, and Michael Fassbender. That's as well rounded a cast as you'll ever see in a movie like this.

The not-so-subtle name Mallory has an etymology meaning ""bad,"" which is ironic as Mallory isn't a contract killer. She carries out jobs requiring a high level of military skill. She believes the work she is doing is good. The first job we follow her on is a hostage rescue. The next is to be eye candy with an MI6 agent. Of course, neither turns out to be as it seems at first, but that's what they are in her eyes.

Permalink",True,"Gina can't act. No facial expressions. No variances in tone for delivery of lines. No charisma! There were a lot of cut-aways from her face. Voice-overs instead. Like when she's on the phone, or talking to another character, they show the other character, not her, but you hear her voice. Or times her face would be in shadowy darkness, or her back was shown when she was talking. Or scenes were shot at a distance. I can only assume the filmmakers notice the same as me, no facial expressions whatsoever and decided to shoot it this way.

I love love love badass kickass women on screen. Some of my favourites are Kate Beckinsale in the Underworld movies, Angelina Jolie in the Tomb Raider movies and Salt, Linda Hamilton in T2, Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, Milla Jovovich in the Resident Evil movies, Peta Wilson in the Nikita series, and Lucy Lawless in Xena. All these women can convey anger, grief, surprise, softness, humour, steely-eyed coolness, and so much more using facial expressions, body language, and the right vocal tone for delivery of lines. That's what makes a great female action star. Not just fighting skills.

Was the idea to cast a bunch of talented stars in this, and therefore it will be hit? I mean Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Bill Paxton, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas! The look-at-the-talented- actors stunt didn't work. From what I can tell the movie didn't generate much at the box office. Not a whopping hit! The ""a-listers"" here seemed awkward and out of place, and most definitely wasn't any of the actors' best work. I won't include Channing Tatum. He and his wooden acting fit in perfectly.

The story was ho-hum recycled from Salt, the Bourne films and others. Normally recycling stories wouldn't bother me, and I'd be OK with that if it were well done, but it wasn't. Add to that, the bad acting, an annoying soft black fish-eye effect, and dullness of it all, made it, well frankly, yawn zzzzzzzz....

Has a pretty cool sound track. A lot of sound track actually. Because there aren't much lines. None of the actors had much to say. What does that tell you?

I honestly wanted to like this. I was so looking forward to another great female kickass action movie and heroine and possibly a continuing series. To my disappointment, this is what I got instead, dull story and bad acting! 4/10

Permalink",False,"I was surprised I liked this as much as I did... I am normally not a fan of the genre and I sort of see why now.

The film is nothing earth shattering but it's a good solid film, well directed, well paced, with a plot that makes sense. Rare qualities these days.

The fight choreography though was a game changer... it was amazing.

The star is someone I've never heard of but she's pretty good and surrounded by a weirdly great cast, she was a little wooden in places (in a Keanu Reeves kind of way) but it worked for the character.

I am a little surprised by the reviews of the film, it's underrated and hopefully a sign of things to come.

I thought the performances were good but the story suffered as a confusion to me because it starts you somewhere then catapults you somewhere different. I think it would have worked much better as a linear story as apposed to a giant 90 min flashback that eventually caught up to itself. The ending was really rushed and abrupt will we ever find out what happened to Antonia Bandaras most likely not. I was impressed by the fighting though the world needs more female heroines. All in all the story was too confusing and struggled to hit the mark with me.

Permalink",False,"I really don't understand all of the snarky, hate filled reviews of this movie. Apparently the 14 year old boys who have written the cookie cutter bad reviews don't like the lack of cgi or nudity. The action in this film is much more realistic than the usual fantastical, beyond human capability, action, and the car chase is real world, not impossible cgi enhanced.

As for the acting, well Gina Carano isn't going to sway any academy voters, but she is fine in the role of a double-crossed government contractor, and is a worthy stunt performer. Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum, and Michael Fassbender are believable, and Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas have small contributing parts.

So don't be swayed by the 1 or 2 star teenage boy reviews. This is a satisfying, intelligently scripted film. And Steven Soderberg's usual visual creativity makes this a stylish thriller.

Permalink",False,"The problems with HAYWIRE can be laid firmly at the door of director Steven Soderbergh, who is entirely unsuited to directing what should be a pulse-pounding thriller. Soderbergh's light 'n' breezy, art-house-style direction is at odds with the kind of gritty, realistic, down 'n' dirty vibes he's aiming for here, and the result is an oddly unrewarding movie that goes through the motions, ticks all of the boxes, and yet fails to make any impact on the viewer whatsoever. Although it looks good, it turns out to be a hollow, slightly soulless exercise in movie-making.

The good thing about HAYWIRE are the martial arts scenes: they're very well filmed, highly exciting and utilise to full advantage the skills of real-life mixed martial arts fighter and lead Gina Carano. Having recently rewatched the BOURNE trilogy (in preparation for the upcoming BOURNE LEGACY), I can acknowledge they're the equal of anything in those movies. However, it's the long, slow passages in-between the action that really cause this film to stall. Soderbergh shoots them in his usual way, with jazzy music playing in the background and subdued, quick-fire dialogue, and while that worked in the likes of THE LIMEY and OCEAN'S ELEVEN, it just doesn't here.

The whole exercise feels artificial, and you get the impression that Soderbergh is trying too hard. There's no palpable tension, no sense of build-up, no suspense about what's going to happen to the protagonist. In fact, it's all rather boring, and you're left itching for the next fight scene to take place. Compare this with THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, in which I was on the edge of my seat during the non-action bits, caught up in an involved conspiracy storyline, unable to wait to find out what was going to happen next. HAYWIRE flatlines between the martial arts antics.

The script doesn't help; it's on the level of the average Seagal DTV actioner, and makes some truly odd decisions (like highly skilled/unbeatable agent Carano telling her life story in flashback to a random stranger throughout the course of the film ‚Äì far better to have adopted a linear structure and just begun at the beginning instead of this wannabe clever-clever stuff). There are other pluses: the cast is faultless, and Soderbergh even elicits a rather effective performance from walking muscle Channing Tatum. But some of the seasoned performers are underutilised: Douglas, Banderas and Paxton are given little to work with, and Ewan McGregor is miscast in a wishy-washy role."

Permalink",False,"The classic ""secret agent betrayed by the government"" plot is one of the most popular ones in straight-to-DVD cinema, in which we have many times seen ""actors"" such as Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren and Casper Van Dien in cheap action films, fighting against generic villains and provoking all the destruction permitted by the low budget from the project. Under the direction from the acclaimed Steven Soderbergh, the film Haywire took a similar premise to the big screen, with various famous actors, exotic locations and a visual style much more elegant and elaborated than the one we have seen in the previously mentioned straight-to-DVD cinema.

The plot from Haywire is simple, but screenwriter Lem Dobbs complicated it by telling it through flashbacks, and as a consequence, the screenplay takes shape gradually, creating suspense and occasionally surprising us when the connection between apparently isolated events is revealed. I also liked the way in which Dobbs outlined the story in broad strokes so that we take care of filling in the details, basing ourselves on the ambiguous dialogs and other clues left by the screenplay. I also liked the visual style, simultaneously retro and modern, but with an own identity which doesn't feel as an aesthetic ornament, but as a valid technique which complements the dynamic narrative.

Gina Carano achieved fame in the Mixed Martial Arts sport, and she also participated in some TV roles. Haywire is her debut as a film actress, and I'm glad to say that her work is extraordinary. She displays a magnetic presence, overflowing charisma and an intensity we will never see in ""action actresses"" who obviously need stunt doubles even to open the door of a car (Jessica Alba and Katherine Heigl come to mind). In supporting roles, we find Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton, Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender playing characters which are a bit hollowly written, and which represent gear in order to facilitate the screenplay's advance. The only actor who plays a well built supporting role is Ewan McGregor, and he makes a solid work.

In conclusion, I recommend Haywire. Despite a few forced details from the story and the previously mentioned hollow supporting characters, I liked it pretty much, because of its interesting screenplay, Carano's brilliant work, and Soderbergh's creative direction."

Permalink",False,"After reading mixed reviews on Haywire I wasn't expecting much and in doing so I actually enjoyed this. If you go into this film expecting a Jason Statham, Bond or Bourne movie though you will be disappointed.

Haywire is not your average action movie, whilst the formula is still the same (double crossed agent seeks revenge) it's the delivery that is different. If you had to put this movie in a certain category it would be 'Arthouse'.

If it wasn't for the big cast I doubt this movie would have seen the light of day. The main character Gina Corano has an enormous presence on screen and I predict big things for her in the future. Unfortunately Ewan McGregor's part is pretty lame, Michael Fassbender Mi6 agent is very convincing, Banderas and Douglas also make this film more watchable.

Permalink",True,"The Hollywood Machine again disappoints. What was the deal with Haywire. Throw a bunch of names in a movie for a couple of scenes each and put up an action trailer and except to clean up. A handful of star names spit out crap dialogue as the plot tries to cover up a fighter that fights well and sounds like robo cop when she speaks. I read after on line that they altered her voice. Why? Her delivery was robotic as it was, why the Robocop touch, maybe if they made her an actual robot it would have paid off, but she wasn't a robot, she was an ex op who should be able to crush her opponents ‚Äì which she did, look good doing it ‚Äì which she did, and deliver her lines dramatically and efficiently ‚Äì which she didn't. In addition to struggling through her lines, she ran around awkwardly and continuously during a couple of scenes with odd background music. I have to admit, the score was daring, but it didn't fit the movie. It might have been better than the movie, because it was daring and creative and not the typical you'd find in an action movie, but it didn't match up at times. You can't throw ranch dressing on a pile of crap and expect miracles. In the end, even though the music was interesting, it didn't work in the movie, it stood out too much, and when u start to notice the music a lot more than the movie that's a problem. There are too many problems with this movie and not enough substance.

Permalink",False,"Soderbergh turns his hand to the 'Action' genre, with mixed success. Casting M.M.A. fighter Carano in the lead gives the fight scenes a realistic edge; on the flip side it is obvious that she's not a natural actress. Her delivery of dialogue is at best mechanical. Thankfully the role doesn't involve too much speaking. Probably Soderbergh's reputation helped secure some heavyweight names to play other characters including a suave Michael Douglas (in what I think is his first post cancer-battle role) and dependable Ewan McGregor. The movie's plot revolves around private contract agent Kane (Carano) being betrayed by her employer - yeah, that old chestnut. We see a lot of the narrative through flashback scenes as the betrayal unfolds. Keeping up with the twists takes some concentration and I felt the story was a overly convoluted at times. Since the 'Bourne' films all action/espionage productions that want to be taken seriously apparently feel it is necessary to cram in as much shadow play as possible. 'Haywire' does have it's good moments, that revolve around the hand to hand combat. But like a jaded diamond, it lacks sparkle.

You aptly respond, ""It was a 'Haywire' film"". ""A Haywire film?"". ""Yes, the film I just saw was poorly written, filmed and featured some serious overacting, like that film 'Haywire'.""

There was only one cinematic positive to come out of Haywire. Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Ewan Mcgregor, and Michael Fassbender are all now unquestionably confirmed as the talented and skillful performers they are seen to be. This is because despite the fact that they were reciting lines from a poorly written script, they unsurprisingly performed their depth- lacking roles convincingly to a confused and disinterested audience.

After freeing a Chinese journalist that is being held hostage black-ops government agent Mallory (Carano) is double-crossed.

I was looking forward to this one based on the exciting preview. The movie started off good enough but very quickly began to drag and made me lose interest throughout. Some of the dialog is laughable and the music cues consisted of a 5 measure sequence ripped off from ""Ocean's 11"". At first it was neat but began to get annoying. Even though Carano is an MMA fighter in real life the fight sequences looked very choreographed and for an action movie it wasn't really all that exciting. All that said though if you liked ""Salt"" or ""Columbiana"" you will most likely like this one too. Not terrible but not original at all. Overall, a movie that is best described as Salt 6 - after ""Hanna"", ""Columbiana"", ""Cat Run"", etc...I give it a B-.

Unfortunately, what you have read or seen in the promotional materials that have been heavily advertised all this while, isn't exactly the kind of straightforward action-packed extravaganza you would hope for. Instead HAYWIRE is an artistic farce disguised as a B-grade action wannabe and worst of all, it's unbelievably boring.

Basically this is Soderbergh's attempt at the espionage genre, and it fails MISERABLY!!!!!! In a nutshell, a black ops team is sent into Barcelona to save a kidnapped victim; only to be betrayed by the organization that hired them (sound familiar¬Ö. Yeah, it's that film ""insert title here""). Anyways, new comer Gina Carano plays Mallory Kane a freelance covert operative. Hire by Ewan McGregor (Kenneth), her handler and (maybe) lover¬Ö. not certain, to be part of the Barcelona assault team; and later recruited recruits her to assist the British MI6 team. However, Mallory, who is always suspicious, quickly suspects something is peculiar; and once the attempt on her life is repelled¬Ö IT'S TIME FOR REVENGE!! I only really enjoyed two (2) scenes in this film. The first being the opening sequence in which Channing Tatum (Aaron) gets his ass handed to him by Mallory; and second the fight sequence between Mallory and the British agent (Michael Fassbender). Everything else the film has to offer has been done, time and time again¬Ö. And way better! Not an awful film, just not up to the standard that you have could to expect in a Steven Soderbergh film. (BTW, though not a pivotal role, but Michael Douglas (Coblenz) looks fantastic in this film¬Ö glad to see that's he back on the big screen after and recovering well after his stint with cancer).

Permalink",False,"The main problem with HAYWIRE is that the script is severely underwritten. Not just in the usual sense of depth and character, but more importantly in the sense that it plays like an unfinished script. Sort of like the screenwriter ran out of time finishing a draft and someone said, ""Look, just slap a closing scene on it and the intern will start making copies."" It really feels that incomplete. So in the end you feel cheated.

All of this is a shame because HAYWIRE had the potential to be a pretty solid action movie. The cast, as usual for Soderbergh, is A-list. The locations, sets, action, all fine. And that brings us to Gina Carano, whom I was expecting to be the weakest link in the film. Well, far from it. Sure, she's got a long way to go before she'll be cast in an Alexander Payne film, but in this film she's perfect. And to Soderbergh's credit, there are some stunning action sequences that probably work better because of a lack of ""acting."" One moment in particular is a shot of Carano leaving a hotel knowing she is being followed. The camera stays in front of her as she walks briskly at us. No music, no running, just fast walking and the natural sounds of the street. You would never see that in a Bourne or 007 film. But I thought the effect was wonderful and provided a brittle tension that finally exploded into an excellent chase sequence.

Unfortunately, moments like those are all for naught since the script is simply MIA. And if Steven Soderbergh can miss such basic story structure problems like the ones in HAYWIRE, then maybe a few years painting might do him some good."

Permalink",False,"There is no doubt that Soderbergh is one of the most commercially viable independent filmmakers working today. Consistently inventive with his directing techniques and constantly challenging himself with various genres. It's unfortunate that his gracious effort in the action genre succumbs to ""over direction"". An operative is sent to Barcelona to retrieve an asset, however she soon discovers that it's all a setup and must investigate who the culprit is. There are certain elements that really work, and many that send this conspiracy thriller tumbling down the route of genericism. The action, although infrequent, was shot with precision. It allowed Carano, a well established MMA fighter, to perform her own stunts cleanly. A refreshing change from the ""shaky cam"" method and rapid quick cuts. The ensemble cast all performed well, sure there were several moments of monotony, however it's a cold calculated environment. Soderbergh maintains a professional aesthetic, both in characters and production, that enhances the nature of the conspiracy. Plenty of varying locations, many kidney punches and a plethora of headlocks. Job done. The problem is that Soderbergh's direction is so outstanding that it acts as a veil for a dull, formulaic and thinly written plot. What should've been an engaging story with decent camera techniques has now become a case of style over substance, and it just doesn't work. Simply put, it is boring. I don't care for these characters. I don't care for the conspiracy plot. I don't care for the film. It is so focused on introducing famous actors as potential culprits that anything engaging is subsided. The dialogue lacks personality, but I get it. It's a concise thriller. Our protagonist obtains the information she requires and moves on. Rinse and repeat until she has gone through everyone. Haywire was a missed opportunity. Despite the fantastic choreography, direction and cast, you just can't utilise independent contemporary techniques to convey a simple plot. Otherwise, you lose the story which should always come first."

Permalink",False,"Haywire has Gina Carrano who is a private contracting secret agent who has a confrontation with colleague Channing Tatum at a diner which gets ugly when he tries to force her to go with him. A kid played by Michael gallantly intervenes and saves her. But he hardly realizes what he's gotten himself into.

Turns out Carrano had just gotten home from missions in Barcelona and Dublin and it was in the latter she was set up for a murder. The only question is which of her colleagues betrayed her. As it turns out she was planning to leave the agency and someone thought she was expendable. Some retirement plan.

Half the film is in flashback as Carrano tells her tale to her new ally Angerano and the other half trying to identify her betrayer.

I wasn't terribly impressed with the film overall though it does have some moments. Things get a bit incoherent at times with the story. I did however love her final confrontation scene with her betrayer and how said betrayer meets his demise.

Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas are in this and have the look of men happy their paychecks cleared.

Not the best spy thriller out there."

Permalink",True,"I cannot understand the current rating for this movie. I find this movie both out of the ordinary as well as very fascinating to watch. Often with action movies the story gets either banal or way to unrealistic. I do not want to spoil anything here, but I started viewing this not completely blank, but after peeking at the description on IMDb. After not too many minutes watching I felt that I had stumbled onto a gem. I could not understand the rating given. Therefore I _had_ to give my honest opinion about this film and rate it accordingly. I can fully recommend this movie as a well written, action packed and, not least important - out of the ordinary type of story. This film starts out high in adrenaline. I was anxious that this would not last. But after some time I was only anxious that the end would not be as good as it had been so far... Silly, I know. Recommendeeeed... (Slight spoil ahead.) There's a lot of fighting in this movie, and I like to think that even if it _is_ a movie, the fighting is very close to realistic. It even seems she has to give way somewhat to larger weight but takes it back with technique, and while most fights in movies makes someone skilled in martial arts laugh out loud, the performance here is mostly impressive with how close to realism they've managed to make it.

In search of the genesis of the intrigue, she must withstand the full force of her former colleagues coupled with misinformed police from both Ireland and the US.

The super-cast featuring Antonio Banderas, Channing Tatum, Michael Fassbender, Evan McGregor and Michael Douglas takes a back-seat in this misguided ride, while screen-time gs henerously gifted to Gina Carano, a physical strong woman with considerable sex appeal, but lacking screen presence to carry a movie. Nonetheless the failure of the movie can not be laid on the beginners shoulders, as in general the movie feels inept, lackadaisical and something more expecting of a beginner, not the seasoned helmer Steven Soderbergh. Absolute travesty for someone of such experience giving the title a very apt double meaning regarding the quality of the finished product.

Some have attempted to defend the movie due to the unusual storytelling employed by Soderbergh and breaking traditional camera angles, but essentially there is no redemption, as the story fails to be the backbone, instead we get a styleless insubstantial cacophony of scenes which struggle to deliver a coherent end result.

Framed within a jumpy script (action fast-forwarding from Dublin to New York with a forced shortcut) with little appeal (going through the tired motions of most genre movies) it squeaks and screeches, rarely getting into second gear. The only redeeming sequence is the Dublin hotel fight between our heroine and Fassbender accompanied with the ensuing rooftop chase across the city."

Permalink",False,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

After a mission in Barcelona doesn't go to plan, Agent Mallory Kane (Gina Carono) keeps a low profile for a while, until she is once again approached by her superior Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) to travel to Ireland, to pose with another agent (Michael Fassbender) as a couple at an exclusive retreat, in order to snare a French national who's been up to no good. But when Kane finds herself double crossed, she finds herself on the run, framed for a murder she committed in self defense and unable to trust anyone.

The novelty of having a bona fide martial artist in the lead role isn't as strong as it was in the halycon years of Seagal and Van Damme, being in the age of wire fu and CGI and such. So female MA sensation Gina Carano will probably find herself diving nose first towards the straight to DVD path now. As indeed this none event little offering really should have, had it not been for the inexplicable all star cast, a range of old and younger hot talent, and even more inexplicable big name director. One might only assume Steven Soderbergh has some Nicolas Cage style weird leaning towards B action movies, because it's either that or he's really allowed his standards to fall.

An incoherent, convoluted story is matched by a long interval of deadly dull nothingness, as the movie goes through the motions, throwing up all the usual genre clich√©s, from the characters to the scenarios, with a big name cast carrying it all through, but with all the passion and sincerity of a dead fish. From relative new comers McGregor and Fassbender, to old hands like Antonio Banderas and Michael Douglas in standard crooked double agents supporting roles, it just smacks of an easy pay cheque to all involved, some trying to big up their careers while the good stuff stalls and others just grateful for the work still coming their way in the autumn of their careers. Other than that, it's really hard to figure out what anyone involved was hoping to achieve from it. **"

The fight scenes in this movie were exciting and rather surprising and the acting was as expected nothing short of the talent brought by the cast itself, even from the young and rather unknown star actress. However it can be said that sound track can make or break a film, and in this case Soderberg broke the camels back. The entire movie sounded like a back stage pass to a smooth jazz club mixed with something you'd hear watching an episode of Monk, I almost expected to see The Pink Pather pop around the corner at any given moment and save the day, which sadly never happened. My recommendation to you if you watch this film is to skip to all the fight scenes, avoid the last 10mins and keep your TV muted.

Permalink",False,"Going in, I wanted to like Haywire and I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but the movie was just average with only a couple positives that couldn't overcome the substantial misses. Gina Carano plays an international spy who is betrayed by her own people and fights to clear her name and save her life.

Gina Carano was good in the lead role. Although she seemed to be reading lines in many scenes, she was captivating as the protagonist. Her action scenes were fun and energetic, and she was effective playing a strong and emotionless spy fighting in a man's world. She has a captivating presence, but she does need some acting lessons.

The supporting actors were very disappointing, as most just mailed in flat performances to collect a check. From Ewan McGregor to Antonio Banderas to Channing Tatum, their acting was flat and disengaged. The actors seemed unsettled in supporting roles to a Hollywood newcomer and enduring some less than flattering scenes for them.

In addition, I struggled with the directing. The movie lacked a good pace, dragging in several places. For example,a scene of the main character walking down a sidewalk seemed to last forever and become almost comical. And, several dramatic and climatic scenes actually drew laughter from the audience, as they seemed almost cartoonish.

Haywire is at best a Netflix rental when you can't find anything else of value to watch. Gina Carano, despite her flaws, is the only positive in an otherwise poorly acted and poorly directed action film."

Permalink",False,"This is definitely one of the lesser Soderbergh movies that I have seen. But as it turns out; even a lesser Soderbergh is still a perfectly watchable movie.

There were quite a few issues I was having with this movie, while watching it. It picks an original enough spy genre approach, that just isn't a very exciting one however. Seems that it wanted to go for realism but yet the movie is being filmed as a typical action-flick, even while this is definitely not a spectacular or action-filled movie.

But also the story itself is being told in such a messy way that it becomes just too hard to follow. It makes you loose interest in it, pretty early on already. It doesn't help that the movie feels like it isn't going anywhere with its story. It doesn't lay things out clearly for you and you constantly need to pay attention. Nothing wrong with that of course but it just doesn't work out too well for the movie. simply because it's never getting interesting enough. I just couldn't care less about anything that was happening in it, or for any of its characters.

And really, Gina Carano, who plays the lead role, was absolutely horrendous. She just can't act, which totally took me out of the movie. Watching her act with greats such as Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender and Antonio Banderas doesn't ever look right. Watching her doing spy stuff doesn't ever look right or convincing. And even watching her fight doesn't look right. It sounds strange, since she is a professional fighter and all but seeing her doing wrestling moves, in a spy movie, just doesn't look right at all and came across as quite ridicules, to me.

Nothing about the movie really impressed me but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie as well. It's still a maintaining enough, little spy thriller, that however in the end is extremely forgettable.

Actually where is the story? Maybe at the 5 last minute you see one... Fast and furious is a piece of art in comparison to that. The only good part, I have to admit is the fact the girl know how to fight, that's all. But she always have a strange smile on her face, even when she should be really scared...

First one - how did this got made in the first place? I find it insane that Soderbergh cast Gina Carano as a goddamn lead in this and then cast all star acting crew around her. I mean, supporting actors here are Tatum, Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Banderas, Michael Douglas, etc.

Don't get me wrong, stunt casting is sometimes interesting and I generally like Carano in Deadpool but she is so flatfaced and not good in this. Yeah, fights are cool, but you don't get that star cast just to support someone who is a noob actor like her.

It's confusing and kinda boring movie, which is even more perplexing given the great supporting cast. Story is not that good as well and photography is somewhat average with completely uninteresting shots and frames.

Weird-but-not-that-bad movie this Haywire is. Can't recommend it though, except if you want to see how odd it is.

Permalink",False,"This film, on its own, would have received a subaverage rating for the bad acting, the boring plot and the pointless action. However, done by Soderbergh and having Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender and Michael Douglas in the cast... I rate it even lower for the pure impudence of using a few good actors in order to sell a bad film.

The story is simple: betrayed super duper agent seeks the people that set her up. It has been done to death, but each time there was something added to make it interesting: exotic locations, good actors, flamboyant action scenes. Instead, this had a bleak, fractured feel that left the viewer confused and not because the plot was terribly convoluted, but because it was malexplained. Gina Carano is no actress and it shows. The music was something stolen from Ocean's Eleven.

Bottom line: Soderbergh wanted to make a movie and show his craftsmanship in a genre that is making a comeback now, after everybody has forgotten most of the experiments in stupidity from three or four decades ago in the same genre. He called a few friends and made them play small roles so that he could also sell the movie, no matter how bad it was. In the end, he can cry that no one understands art while he counts the cash he makes from duped viewers like you and me. Shame on you, Soderbergh!"

Permalink",True,"I was really looking forward to a 'Bourne' type of movie with a lead female actress. Although this movie didn't receive a very high voting, I still wanted to check it out, because action type movies tend to be very underrated compared to other genres.

So there am I, starting to watch this movie. First scene, a guy walks into a bar, sits down next to a beautiful lady, chit-chats with her for a few minutes, and then they start fighting. So here comes the one big, positive point in this movie, the fighting. You cannot help but realize that the protagonist being a woman, she is bound to have problems in her fights with bigger and heavier men, and this issue is handled perfectly. Not once does it feel too forced, and it's just the kind of kicking butts you might expect from this type of character.

Unhappily, this is where the praise ends.

Every other aspect of this movie, and I mean it, was fairly dreadful. First of all the story. It's just C-grade no imagination standard Hollywood script. It is so foreseeable it is not even funny after a time. But that wouldn't have killed the movie by itself.

This female actor, Gina Carano, as I learned after wieving the movie, is in her first serious role. And there is not really another way to say it: she cannot act. She simply can't. When you see her in her dress talking with other people, it feels wrong. When she is running away from the police, she behaves in an odd girlish (I'm sorry, this is what best describes it in my opinion) way that feels wrong. The problem is, that 85% of the screen time is just her. And she can't handle it. And even other actors like Micheal Douglas, or Evan McGregor cannot save her performance since they are accorded so little room in the movie. At times it's just painful to watch.

And then another thing: the music. I don't know if this was meant to be a joke, but it is so out of place I can hardly put words on it. I guess to closest music to this one would be the ones played in TV commercials. And that's how you feel. When she is being chased: TV commercial. When she fights the bad guys: TV commercial. When she expresses emotions (not very often): TV commercial. It really kills the movie.

I don't usually do this, but I fast-forwarded through the last half hour of the movie. My advice: don't watch it. It's not worth your money, not even your time. The only thing that makes this 2 stars instead of one is the great effort on the fighting scenes.

Her acting equals Kristen Stewart's facial expressions..it's the same throughout the ENTIRE movie. Don't waste your time. The beginning had a really slow start and I thought that maybe it was going to take awhile to get good, but no it didn't get good until it ended and even the ending was bad...I was mad at myself for wasting that much time of my life on a movie that was so bad. Some movies are bad because of how unrealistic it is, but this one takes the cake. The fight scenes leave much to be wanted and it is so funny how the lead actress can be in such violent fights and can walk away without a single bruise right after the fight. And then in the end when she finds the guy that no one could find and fights him on the beach, why didn't he shoot her?? He had a gun on him but the entire fight he does nothing but run. So, don't walk...RUN and find something else to watch.

Permalink",False,"Some type of secret operative named Mallory, played by Carano, arrives at a diner. Later another operative, played by Tatum, arrives. A fight breaks out between the two. She escapes in a car kidnapping the owner. For some reason she decides to tell him everything.

Some time in the past she was given a mission in Barcelona to rescue some Chinese guy who was held captive. The mission doesn't go smoothly but succeeds. After that mission, her handler asks her to take on a simple mission in Ireland playing an agent's wife. Once there she notices things aren't quite right. And sure enough, the agent tries to kill her. She also finds the Chinese guy she rescued before dead in a barn.

Mallory now is on her own with law enforcement on her trail. She manages to escape and make it to the US- to the diner. Back in the US she continues to be on the run from her black ops colleagues. Her father is a renowned war history author living in New Mexico. She manages to make it over there where she'll be followed by her enemies.

There is also a politician behind all this pulling the strings. And in the end we find out exactly what is going on. The whole rescue operation of the Chinese was more like a private vendetta by a some corrupt rich guy trying to rid himself of his enemies and Mallory knew too much so she had to be eliminated by the very people she trusted.

Haywire has a good story and great action scenes. Carano is gorgeous and can actually fight. This isn't your typical anorexic Hollywood actress pretending to be an invincible action superheroine. Her voice-acting isn't convincing though. Since they tinkered with her voice in post-production, it's hard to tell if the issue is with Carano or post-production. Regardless, I applaud the decision to cast Carano. In the hands of another director, things could have turned out differently. Usually directors go out of their way to glorify their female leads beating up on 300lb guys. Soderbergh doesn't know how to do that. Not only that, but direction in general is very spotty. It's hard to believe this was directed by Soderbergh. This movie comes across like the work of a foreign first-time director. Another thing that ruins the movie is the ridiculous music. Music has a place in movies, it shouldn't be treated like a lead character though. And in this movie we get to hear constantly some silly caper tune that belonged in one those awful Ocean's 13 movies. Here it's played loudly over exciting events or action scenes.

Haywire had a lot potential, an excellent cast, a strong story, but direction is so poor that it manages to ruin it."

From the first scene, you can tell that non of them can act. The story line doesn't make any sense, there's a 20 mins clips of flashing imagines of people running around in Paris with some crappy tune on so no talking.

I had to leave after 30mins although I wish I had left sooner, the more i stayed the worse it got.

Please please please do not see this movie, its not soo bad that you can even laugh, its just plain bad, I rarely review movies, but this one annoyed me so much I felt I had an obligation to save others from my suffering. I lost half hour in there.. thats half hour of my life am never going to get back.

Permalink",False,"I usually like Soderberg, but this one is just... lame. This is one of those movies where, if you watched it in a theater, someone near you would be going ""Who's that?"" and ""Why did they do THAT?""... only this time it would be YOU.

This movie has so much ""WTF?"" in it that it makes a typical Hong Kong action picture make perfect and complete sense by comparison. The fight sequences are probably fairly honest -- she does get her butt kicked as often as she kicks ass, and doesn't win against other martially trained males easily. The lack of swelling after getting clocked in the face a few times is a bit unrealistic, but we'll give them that much...

I give it a ""4"" for the fight sequences. But that's -really- the only thing that's any good, and only a little bit of those are really inventive in terms of moves.

Permalink",False,"The lead actress, Gina Carano, was brutal.

She must have been hired for her fighting skills and not her acting ability. The movie had such an amazing supporting cast (Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton, hell even Channing Tatum was OK) and Soderbergh directing. Too bad she ruined it, despite everyone else.

Granted, the writing was really weak in many of the scenes, like it was done by a 13 year old, so it wasn't *all* her, just most of it. The scenes without her were excellent.

Overall, I give it a 3/10. The fight scenes were average at best and, at times, just ridiculous - not enough to redeem the horrible lead and crappy lines.

I doubt I'll be seeing anything with Gina Carano again anytime soon.

I guess they figured that most of the women in the country are fat, so this would be accepted. I was actually surprised that Mr. Douglas, and Banderas signed up for this.

The fight scenes speeds were indicative of the agility or should I say lack thereof, it seemed like they did not spend that much time even rehearsing them. I am probably most upset with the casting of the main role which is why the movie does not work for me and curious as to what others thought as well.

Permalink",False,"Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is some kind of secretive government agent or super-spy. We are never explained what she does because apparently all that matters is that she is very good at beating up fellow agents and killing bad guys, and vice versa. Everything that she does is complete nonsense. I'm assuming because she's a girl, that's supposed to make it cool rather than stupid.

The beginning is set in upstate New York where after she karate chops Channing Tatum to within an inch of his life, she runs away with Michael Angarano. I have loved his characters in all of his previous movies, but here, he willingly hands her his keys and she abducts him with his car and ""explains"" what's going on. None of which made any sense but the only clarification he needed was with their names. I don't even know what to say to that.

A third of the way through we settle down for a few moments without action in Ireland (this is after a trip through many different cities for no reason). The action didn't stop so we could get to know characters; the action stopped so we could start getting interested in Mallory. She appears to have been set-up but by who and why is probably never going to get answered. So I think we're only supposed to ogle at how sexy she is as she jumps over buildings and other such escapades.

It's directed by Steven Soderbergh and at least there's credit to that as the shots were beautifully crafted with great lighting and use of colour. There are many great actors but I have no idea why since none of them had anything to do, except dying. Actors do love their death scenes. But ""Haywire"" failed to give me any reason to watch this."

Permalink",True,"If you've spent any time at all over the last 30 years in video stores, you've probably seen a certain sub-section of the action genre where low-budget filmmakers corral themselves a reasonably attractive female martial artist, or at least someone with enough training to be passed off as such, and decide to make a movie out of her beating guys senseless. Haywire is, nothing more and nothing less, the classiest such motion picture to date. It's got the best cast any such flick has ever dreamed of having. The star is probably the most legitimate and dynamic ass-kicker ever seen in such a project. And under the direction of Steven Soderbergh, Haywire looks a thousand times better than any such film ever has. This basically could pass as another Ocean's movie, just without Clooney, Pitt or 99% of the sense of humor. However, all that talent and skills fails to obscure the fact that this entire production is just a shrine to the physicality of MMA star Gina Carano. Not that I'm complaining, mind you.

Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is what used to be called a mercenary but is now usually referred to as a ""contractor"". She works for a private security/paramilitary company run by her ex-boyfriend Kenneth (Ewan McGregor). He talks her into taking a job in Barcelona to rescue a hostage and then talks her into another job in Dublin where the Barcelona hostage turns up dead and Mallory is set up to take the blame for it. She foils that but still winds up on the run trying to figure out who set her up, why and how she can choke him to death with her thighs.

Let's be frank. Whatever impulse it was that drove Soderbergh to make The Girlfriend Experience with porn star Sasha Grey is the same thing that resulted in Haywire getting made with Carano, but things worked out much better this time around. Unlike Grey, Carano can actually do what she's good at on screen without getting an X-rating. That means Soderbergh is able to craft a movie around Carano's athleticism and hand-to-hand combat prowess rather than come up with some cock and bull plot about internet escort subculture and the financial crisis of the late 2000s. This film puts Mallory Kane in peril and then sits back and watches her turn that peril back upon her attackers.

Which means that, for all Soderbergh's ability, what makes or breaks Haywire is Carano and her performance. Her fight scenes are excellent. Gifted with a woman who can take a hell of a punch and dish one out, the movie dispenses with camera movement and quick cuts. Carano and her male co-stars are allowed to battle in clear, linear fashion and the result is scenes where it looks like people are actually getting hurt. This isn't choreographed ballet. It's trained killers trying to do each other in. Carano has a fluidity of movement that's not at all Jackie Chan-ish. You never look at her and think she's dancing. She's fighting.

As for her acting? Well¬Öshe doesn't embarrass herself but that may only be because Carano is asked to do so very little in Haywire. She reads her lines competently but any emoting is kept at the most simple levels, by design or accident, and she more or less pulls off what she's asked to do. If Carano looks bad, it's only in comparison to the high quality cast surrounding her. But if you're in a line up with Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas and Bill Paxton, it's not going to be hard for viewers to spot the non-actor in the group.

There's nothing exceptional here with the story, dialog or filmmaking, save for one scene involving a seemingly suicidal deer. Haywire only looks great in comparison to the rest of its sub-genre. Compared to similar movies with similar casts and similar creators, there's little here that stands out. Soderbergh didn't go into this with any other thought in his head except ""Man, I really dig that Gina Carano"". If you watch this film, you'll probably dig her too but I'll be surprised if this isn't the high point by far of any career Carano has in cinema. We can only hope the pattern continues and the next time Soderbergh becomes infatuated with some non-actress, that project will be better than Haywire as much as Haywire is better than The Girlfriend Experience.

Permalink",False,"Soderbergh in the director's chair. The cast looked promising with McGregor, Douglas, Tatum, Banderas and Fassbender on the bill. Carano is a credible martial artist and so all that was required was a decent script. Aargh! The script! Someone obviously forgot about the script.

This film has a touch of the 'Oceans' about it - unsurprising, given the director. However, what we end up with is neither thought-provoking thriller nor adrenalin-pumping action fodder, but a rather unsatisfying mishmash of the two genres.

Rule number one: make your audience feel something about the lead character. Engendering a feeling of indifference means that you've failed. This tale is definitely back-story lite. If I don't have enough of a back-story to work with then there is little chance of developing some sort of rapport with any of the protagonists.

Stick Carano in something like a Witchblade remake and I'll watch it. Otherwise, get a decent action movie director in the chair for her next cinematic excursion."

Permalink",False,"Steven Soderbergh, Hollywood's most overrated living director, once again demonstrates his talents are closer to Ed Wood than Sergio Leone, with ""Haywire"". How else can one explain how mixed-martial arts expert Gina Carano can appear less capable than Angelina Jolie in ""Salt,"" ""Wanted"" or either of the Lara Croft films. However, like Jolie, Carano is another striking beauty and has enough acting chops to generate interests in spite of Soderbergh's ineptitude. This is no small achievement, given the inability of veterans Oscar winner Michael Douglas, multiple Golden Globe nominees Antonio Banderas and Bill Paxton to register any impact at all. Soderbergh's annoying style of using minimal, frequently unintelligible dialog, medium shots which fail to capture acting nuances and little or no establishing narrative certainly don't help. Even the guns look phony in ""Haywire"". As much as I normally hate voice-overs, I certainly would have welcomed Carano's, not only because her voice is sexy, but because I would have actually understood what the heck was going on before I lost interest. Maybe next time, Carano will be fortunate enough to work with Phil Noyce (""Salt"") or Doug Liman (The Bourne Series) or someone who actually understands how to direct engaging action films. I give ""Haywire"" a 5, solely for showcasing Carano."

The soundtrack was a terrible mismatch to the film, and there were only a few decent performances, which were of course underused. I didn't care about any of the characters, so there was no real incentive to keep watching. The fight scenes are good, but few and far between, and not long enough. It also felt contrived that Gina Carano, who is a seasoned mixed martial arts fighter, was seen to be fighting with pussy ass Hollywood actors who she could have easily wiped the floor with in 2 seconds flat. Totally broke any kind of suspension of disbelief. A poor effort.

I really can't believe what I am reading in some reviews praising this film because I must say this film was one of the poorest excuses for a spy thriller I have ever had to endure, can you believe I picked this over Ghost Protocol in the DVD store? I haven't read one review on Tom Cruise's latest film but I know it wil be better than this.

The only good thing about this film was the well-choreographed fight scenes that are not enough to make a film watchable. I don't think I seen any blood drawn though so maybe I'm being over-the-top in saying they were good, they did not redemm this film in any way.

Wooden acting by the female lead, long drawn out sequences in the film were nothing much is happening, a very loose story-line that I didn't really care much about. I would rate this film as 1 star for everything apart from the fight scenes, they get a 3. A decent cast that somehow got fooled into making this terrible film, I feel sorry for them. I wonder just how awkward it must have been the first time they sat down to watch the edited cut?

This film should have went straight to DVD and even at that should have come with a warning as to just how bad a film this is. I blame the director entirely.

I believe there is a lot of false PR being put out online praising this film because I have never felt the need to write a review on a film until I watched this. I can think of two really badly acted/directed films I've previously seen but they turned out to be the film director's student films dressed up as a feature film, Haywire was just as bad."

Permalink",True,"Another case of ""awesome, bad-ass trailer, crappy movie"" I'm afraid.

As in, the one scene that's shown in the trailer that I saw before watching this movie ended up being the very best scene in the entire film (i.e. the part where Gina and Fassbender beat the snot out of each other in their hotel room).

Turns out it's very much downhill from that point forward.

First of all, the acting. Pretty awful. She's better than what you'd expect from an MMA fighter, and much prettier, but it's painfully obvious that the rest of the cast is trying to cover her lack of skill as best they can...and on a sidenote, WOW, I haven't seen that many cameos in a while. Too bad they didn't save the movie in the slightest.

The plot is hard to follow, and what parts you do manage to latch on to are boring as hell.

The dialogue is flat, monotonous, unoriginal...just painful. Rehashed spy-movie one-liners every now and then.

Worst of all? The damned music. Before watching the movie, I had no clue the director was the same guy that made Ocean's Eleven. And yet I definitely caught an Ocean's-Eleven-vibe while listening to the music that plays in almost every chase-scene. They just re-used that theme to DEATH in the worst possible moments, ruining most of the supposed action scenes and only adding to the boredom and disbelief.

I expected a dumb yet entirely FUN movie, where a hot chick beats the tar out of a bunch of guys and drives away into the sunset.

Instead I got the bastard child of Ocean's Eleven and a really, really stale spy flick.

The thin is with Soderbergh movies is that he can always recruit a very impressive cast. Ironically, this could be one of the best casts he has ever assembled, for easily his worst movie.

The story and narrative are so stodgy and convoluted, that at times you comment on peoples hair and how much they have grown, which is always a bad sign for a movie.

And despite the lead (who is very good) being a MMA expert, the action scenes and especially the fight scenes, seem way over choreographed and are just too slick. People fall in the right way, and despite the supposed brutality, it all seems very painless.

It's always good to see Douglas on screen, even when he is spouting inane banter like this, but he has very little screen time.

Fassbender is is insanely underused, and the rest of the cast just seem not to be bothered at all.

It's a shame because I was really looking forward to this, but it's nothing new, and it gets very boring, very quickly.

My advice? if you do see this movie, every time Banderas appears, close your eyes, and you instantly have Puss In Boots.

A tragic mess

Permalink",False,"The trailer was good, much better than the movie. Well. in fact I just watched 10 minutes from the movie, it was that bad, bear in mind I didn't pay to watch it, then people ask me why do I steal the movies, there's your answer, make a good movie and I'll be purchasing the Bluray disc. In fact I feel like I have been robbed by watching this for free.

Usually, even if I don't like the movie I watch it until the end, but this one was far too bad for even that. From the first minute I was shocked with the bad acting. I could have done better, hell, my 5 year old cousin could have done better. Were they on drugs or something? Some people here have even compared it to Bourne, are you mad?

Save your money and go watch something decent, as The Grey.

Banderas is an awful actor so he fits right in with his never changing voice & accent.

What is she doing in this movie (or in any, for that matter), especially as a main character? No acting abilities, fights and wins opponents who could ""eat her for breakfast"" and so on. But she can run. Maybe look good (depending on the taste). That's it basically. Writers of this movie should be put before the firing squad and/or prohibited to work anywhere and anyhow.

Having Gina Carano as the main character surely isn't the best choice. She made the character looked flat, despite the movie's attempt to enrich Mallory's character. Acting wise, this one is a strange pick. As Gina Carano made her character bad, the rest of the big names in the cast okay to give live to their parts.

Permalink",False,"I decided to check this movie out, not because of the story/plot/characters, but because I heard the action scenes were good. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. The first fight in the diner managed to get me excited, but by the second one, I had had enough. Both scenes had lots of cuts, which is typical of Hollywood action, but the first one was better choreographed and ""harder hitting"". Now, I can live with a crappy story if the action is good, and can I live with crappy action if the story is good, but not crappy everything. Perhaps later fight scenes might have met, or exceeded, the bar they set with the first one, but I didn't feel like spending 2 hours to see if 20 minutes of action may or may not be good. It just had too much bad dragging the thing down.

First, the score was absolutely terrible and extremely distracting. Every time music played, I was reminded of just how bad it was. Second, information about the story and characters is drip fed to the audience. I don't know if this was intended to create interest, and a desire to find out what was going on, but it just didn't work. I found myself growing increasingly annoyed at being kept in the dark. Third, the lead has potential as an action star, and I liked her well enough in Deadpool, but I'm not quite sure she's leading actress material. Perhaps she was hindered by the script and/or director, but she lacked the skill/on-screen charisma to carry this hot mess."

Her one big advantage is her fighting abilities. She can really hit and more importantly, she can really get hit. It makes the fight scenes that much more exciting.

Permalink",False,"How low can you go? Steven Soderbergh, an Oscar-winning filmmaker, has ended up making bottom-of-the-shelf DTV fare. I should have realized when I saw the truly awful cover art this this movie was complete garbage. How he and experienced writer Lem Dobbs could churn out something as bad as this is really quite an eye-opener.

The plot is presented non-chronologically in order to make it seem more complex when it actually just makes it confusing and boring. I just could not follow it and eventually lost interest. Gina Carano plays a Spook who is set-up or sold-out or...something. Then everyone is trying to kill her and she fights back and blah, blah, blah. Absolute trash.

Carano's acting was (apparently) not that bad, but I have heard that she was dubbed over with Laura San Giacomo. Not sure if there is any truth to this, but it is very odd if so. Many actors pop up for dismissive cameos including Michael Fassbender, an actor who's entire skeleton is made up of cuboid-shaped Lego bricks and someone I am sick to death of seeing in movies, and Ewan McGregor losing the battle with an American accent.

Permalink",True,"Haywire (2011): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: Gina Carano, Ewan McGregor, Channing Tatum, Michael Fassfender, Bill Paxton: High energy excellence starring Gina Carano as a freelance covert assassin whose life spirals towards the struggle for survival when she is betrayed and hunted down. She made a successful rescue mission in Barcelona, but a second mission in Dublin has her struggling to return to the U.S. This is Steven Soderbergh's best film since Traffic and it features martial arts fighting at its most electrifying best. Carano is famous for this sort of sport for real, but on screen she seems natural and believable as she fends off danger as well as seek those whom betrayed her. Her back story is shared with an onlooker who attempted to help her during a struggle at a diner although he learns clearly that some incidences are best left alone. Ewan McGregor plays her contact who issues the double cross but never counted on her surviving. Channing Tatum plays another contact who attacks her at the diner although he is not clear on the full situation at hand. Michael Fassbender has a scene stealing role as a contact whom Carano is suppose to hook up with in Dublin. He is charming and seductive but she never counted on him being her replacement. Bill Paxton plays Carano's father who is an author and former agent himself. He worries about his daughter yet realizes that she is ahead of the game. Films such as this can go wrong in so many ways but rarely do they turn out this well. Soderbergh not only takes into the darker areas of covert operations, he also creates one of the best martial arts films in all its explosive glory. Score: 10 / 10

Permalink",False,"I was very interested to see this movie. A film with a real heroine, a woman that can take care of herself, beat up the bad guys/gals and not just exist as a model actress (though Gina is very beautiful) while all the stunt women do the real work.

However, what I got with this movie was horrible acting with wooden performances, cheesy lounge music over everything, and exceptionally dull dialog. The main draw of a women mma fighter, ""the third best 145 lb (66 kg) fighter in the world"", was that we'd get a real actress that handles all the dialog, the acting and some great fighting, as she actually knows how to fight properly (muay thai no less). However the fight scenes were over-directed, over-edited, and too short. Very few moments even felt like they were Gina, as the heavy editing could've allowed for a stunt double anyway. Gina seems to lack the charisma to hold a lead role as pretty much any of the supporting super-cast gave more energy and life to the film than she was able to.

To see how a movie can look with a real fighter/actor look no further than JCVD. The film with John Claude Van Damme playing a version of himself with realistic action scenes and tense drama. The opening 5 minutes of that film alone better demonstrates what can be done with an actor than knows how to fight than any moment in this film can possibly wish to achieve."

The casting itself is almost a bizarre distraction as the largely unknown to cinema Gina Carano is joined early on by Channing Tatum, then Ewan McGregor appears with Michael Douglas and a bushy bearded Antonio Banderas, then soon after that Michael Fassbender and Bill Paxton show up. It's like one of those dreams that doesn't quite make sense as famous faces keep popping up out of nowhere. The plot is simple as iced water and has been done many times before, they've tinkered around with it a little, but even casual movie goers will know what's coming. And while the few fight scenes are very well done, and Carano more than holds her own both in action and acting, the dialogue throughout is monotonous and flat which really pulls the movie down. And why Soderbergh felt the need to mindlessly switch between black and white and colour during a few scenes is any ones guess (because it looks arty and edgy yet so very pointless). So in the end a film with nothing really new to offer, a bland script, a great, all be very random cast, with some nice action thrown in. If that's what you want, then that's all you'll get from this slightly oddball little flick."

Permalink",False,"I cannot believe this film is by same Director that brought us the outstanding character driven piece ""Traffic"".

The acting here is mediocre from all the big names, Gina Carano fares a little better as she is a WWE Star turned actress I can forgive the lack of excellent acting skills as she conveys the bad ass mercenary persona quite well, with a touch of femininity when the plot requires. Michael Fassbender does okay with a small role as Paul, but Ewan Macgregor is just wasted here as Kenneth, as is Michael Douglas, Bill Paxton and Antonio Banderas in small meaningless clich√©d roles. The sole purpose of their casting is to cram the movie with big names.

The attention to detail from Soderbergh displayed in such films as ""Traffic"" seems to be missing and the slick style of Out of Sight and Ocean Eleven is also absent. There is no real motivation shown for Kenneth (Ewan Mcgregor) to double-cross Mallory (Gina Carano) and the fight sequences are very poorly staged to the point that they become ridiculous. A third of the running time involves the main character, recounting how she was double-crossed to a stranger working in a diner, who helped her out. Why would somebody working for a shady organisation, employed to fulfil equally shady contracts for hire, spill all these details to a complete stranger that has absolutely nothing to do with the situation and cannot help in any way.

Earlier in the film she chases someone on foot in a prolonged but unexciting chase sequence resulting in the guy being beaten up and left moaning under a metal shutter, when asked why she chased him relentlessly she said she hate loose ends ! When she eventually finds the man who double-crossed her she does not even shoot him or stab him, instead she attacks him while walking on the beach, resulting in another poorly staged fight, ending up with him trapped between some rocks and she just leaves him there to drown. I suspect someone in her profession would have just shot him in the back of the head, as the point is to do the job in the most efficient way leaving no loose ends and she already stated this was her way !"

Permalink",False,"I guess giving action movie roles to athletes/fighters isn't limited to men anymore. I watched this movie and worked backwards after seeing the credits, then the pieces fell together for me. More on that shortly.

HAYWIRE tells the story of a contracted agent named Mallory, who gets set up for failure on a mission whose true nature is not immediately revealed. What she has going for her are strong physical skills...in fighting, dexterity, and speed. And she has a certain degree of cunning to outsmart those pursuing her across Dublin. OK, I could see those skills being assigned to our main character in most action flicks (Jason Bourne certainly had them), regardless of gender. But to think that a female could kick the crap out of so many men who are equally trained with similar skills is simply not plausible. But that point is minor in the big scheme of things.

The big problem with this movie is that Gina Carano is a horrible actress. She is one dimensional, showing only toughness with little emotion, even when she is reunited with her father, who seems to be the one positive male influence in her life. There is no vulnerability or even anti-hero aspect to her character, and we in the audience aren't given any reason to root for her. The producers of this movie threw everything they had at making Carano look good, with a supporting cast that includes Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Channing Tatum, and even Antonio Banderas. Most useless in the supporting cast was Bill Paxton, who phoned in his role in this movie, and whose acting has gone downhill over the years. And to have the movie directed by Steven Soderbergh was simply a waste of directing talent. Soderbergh said not too long ago that he was retiring from directing, so if HAYWIRE is his swan song, then he has gone out on a low note from an otherwise exceptional career. Having never seen Carano on screen before, it took the credits rolling at the end of the movie for me to figure out who she was. She is no actress, and the A-list actors previously mentioned were brought in to prop her up.

What the movie did have going for it was excellent cinematography and a decent story line with good action sequences and plot twists, as we are forced to wait until the end of the movie to find out who the man is behind the curtain. But wasting the good talent to bring a newbie on screen as action hero didn't work, regardless of whether the action hero was male or female."

Permalink",True,"I've given the film 2 out of 10, because it does work as a coherent work of fiction. The characters move their mouths and words come out. They press buttons on phones and other people are at the other end and then 'plot' happens. In addition, they swing their arms and legs and people get beaten up. It gets 1 further point for having Michael Fassbender in it.

Other than that, it really is just terrible. The lead actor (who I now understand is an 'MMA' professional) is awful. She can't act, and even the action scenes - which should be her strength - are quite woodenly acted, in my opinion. The chase scenes are horrific- in one instance, she does the 'look back around a corner to see if being followed' thing but it's just all very amateur dramatics. Embarrassing to watch, in all honesty.

The supporting cast are big stars, but horribly underused. Antonio is miscast, and you could easily not realise it's him at all. Why did they bother to pay his salary? I could have played his role just as well, being as he's only in a couple of scenes, and I would've done it for fifty quid and a bag of sweets.

Ewan Mcgregor was actually quite good, but again not properly used. Fassbender doesn't appear to be able to act badly, and again he is brilliant. Very nuanced, menacing, but ultimately killed off in what seemed like an entirely pointless and cold blooded shooting (he was incapacitated anyway, but I guess the wafer-thin plot required a death or whatever. Who really cares at this point...).

The boring and predictable plot eventually 'climaxes' in a series of pedestrian confrontations with predictable results. The pointless and unimaginative revenge fighting proceedings reminded me a bit of the Mortal Kombat movie franchise.

Yeah, exactly...

Some compare her with Bourne, but he sometimes almost lose a fight. She gets hit with a tray in her face and still walks like nothing happened. The bad guy gets thrown a tray to the back of his head and goes straight to the ground.

The acting in this film especially by Gina who plays the lead character in this film is quite ordinary. Lack of emotion during various scenes.

Yeah the fight scenes are quite raw but so are the countless fighting films in Asia. See SPL, Flashpoint, Special ID all incorporating MMA into their films and they work much better. The fighting is nothing special when compared to many of these Asian films.

If I had to point something out its that when we have someone new to the acting scene they shouldn't be cast as a lead character in their first film. They should be cast as supporting characters to give them confidence, more experience and then progress to leading role hopefully.

It would have been much better IMO to cast her against her character and have her play a home-maker or a beach-bunny. Then the film might have achieved lift-off. It was a great idea by Soderbergh to feature Gina Carano in a movie, but this treatment did not work. Ewen MacGregor, who can carry a movie himself, was lost in this picture and basically wasted. It took us a minute realise that it was him. We wish Gina Carano well, and hope that she does not get her beauteous face smashed in in some forthcoming bout, which seems inevitable. Cyborg had a good go but only drew a little blood. Perhaps next time she will smash a cheek-bone or bust an eye. Good luck, Gina!

Permalink",False,"Having read some of the mixed reviews on IMDb, I watched this movie with an open mind. For someone who averages more than a movie a day across many genres and languages, that is not a particularly difficult demand.

I had enjoyed many of Steven Soderbergh works like Traffic and Ocean's Eleven; even his more artsy one like Sex, Lies, and Videotape. With a sterling supporting cast that include Michael DouglasÔºåAntonio BanderasÔºåEwan McGregorÔºåMichael FassbenderÔºåthis could not be a total disaster, right?

Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the most convoluted, unconvincing ""action"" movie I had ever seen. Don't get me wrong, some of the action sequences were expertly done. The roof top chase of Dublin deserved a mention. But beyond that, what was the movie all about?

Is this an ""emotional"" piece? I believe Luc Besson's L√©on: The Professional (1994) had that patted down.

Is this an ""intellectual"" puzzle? John Frankenheimer's Ronin (1998) got me watching it a few times. And will probably so again when it comes around on cable.

It is definitely not a flat out action movie like the Bourne franchise. Nor plain old no brainer entertainment like the long running James Bond series.

So Haywire, if you would excuse the pun, simply went haywire. The romance doesn't sizzle, the plot makes not sense, and even the action itself fails to excite.

I would not try to dissuade you from watching this movie. From director wannabe, it may be an essential lesson on how NOT to blow a big budget. And if you do manage to stay till the very end, maybe you could tell me what it is all about."

Permalink",False,"Unfortunately this movie is the case of the trailer being a lot better than the movie. I was hoping for some nice revenge-movie with a kick-ass female agent. Unfortunately this movie does not really deliver on that. It is quite slow for starters. Sure, at times Mallory does kick some ass but a lot of the time is spent on flashbacks and much of these are really really slow.

The plot is a very standard and unoriginal one about agent getting double-crossed and subsequently deals out some pay-back. I have no problem with that. It is a valid setting for some nice action. The problem lies in the implementation.

The acting is never anything to write home about. You get the feeling all the characters are just reading of the script in order to get the scenes done and over with. As a consequence you never really get any attachment to neither the heroine nor the bad guys. Most of the movie I just sat and waited for the next action scene to begin. There are quite a few good names in this movie but, sadly, none of them are really allowed to ""take the stage"" and give any real performance.

The bottom line is a very mediocre and sometimes downright boring movie."

Permalink",False,"Not a bad film, by any stretch of the imagination. The acting gets a little wooden in places (to be fair, Gina Carano is a fighter and not an actor) and the story isn't the flashiest action picture of all time, but it is still a very watchable film. Probably the most impressive part of this film is that action set pieces look really good. Aside from a couple ""What a conveniently placed ledge!"" moments, the action is fun to watch and generally makes sense.

Now, the big step forward: Gina Carano as a tough female action hero. Sure, there have been other ""actiony"" films about women -- Colombiana, Point of No Return, Domino, etc.-- but they all have the same flaw... the over-sexualization of the protagonist. In Haywire, Gina Carano is usually dressed reasonably, she doesn't get by merely on her looks, and doesn't have to get close to a bad guy by seducing him. In other words, she's a clandestine agent who can kick butts. I love the fact that Soderbergh has put together an action film about a woman and she is perfectly believable as a dangerous person without being butch or a slut.

Final thought: Worth seeing once."

Permalink",True,"Damn. Damn shame. Steven Soderbergh USED to be my favorite director. But, after a string of mediocre films, leading up to this one,Haywire, I'm jumping ship.

Actually, I did that with Contagion, but this was the nail in his coffin.

I'm a fan of the Ocean's films ‚Äì YES, even #12, though that ranks #3 of 3 ‚Äì but this one screamed too much Ocean's, minus the good dialogue, suspense, acting, chemistry, originality and fun. How it mirrored it was with a (now) annoying and overbearing score and fifty camera angles, color or not, of the same shot. It was a good gimmick at one time ‚Äì fun, fresh and kept us going. Here, it was just plain irritating.

But even Soderbergh was wishy-washy with if he wanted the whole movie like that ‚Äì thank GOD he didn't, or just certain scenes.

At any rate, for a minute number of scenes, the movie worked. And I'm only talking about the fairly decent and choreographed fight scenes involving our ""heroine"" Mallory (Carano.) She was fantastic and all the way through ‚Äì her action scenes or, even, just posing, she made me think of her becoming a more serious Lara Croft in a reboot or in a (finally) Wonder Woman movie. It made me really smile when one character does, in fact, call her ""Wonder Woman."" I guess I'm not alone.

Although I might as well have been since this mess of a movie made practically nothing. The movie was predictable as all hell, the conversations stunk, the acting subpar, the suspense:meh and worse of all ‚Äì and I'm talking a deal-breaker for me ever seeing this again: it contained the most unbelievable and outrageously appalling scene between our super-spy Mallory and a civilian she car jacks and spills her adventures/secrets to.

Think sixteen degrees below Jason Bourne and his civilian, Marie. EVEN with memory loss, at least Bourne truly acted like an agent of doom and Marie truly acted like a human in a unique and scary situation. On the flipside, we have this poor and useless of a character, Scott (Angarano), who somewhat acts scared when he's in the middle of death-duel between Mallory and a guy, Aaron (the ever cute-yet-stupid Channing Tatum) and then Scott gets car jacked. For about 1.5 seconds, these events concern him and then he joyfully cares for the stranger, listens to her and repeats back her story of her misadventures.

The movie's so obvious, it needs not a synopsis, but suffice to say, super-spy Mallory is double crossed ‚Äì oh, my! that's new! ‚Äì and she spends the obligatory rest of the movie on the lam and hunting whodunit.

Like I said, I DID enjoy the brief action sequences ‚Äì Carano really did kick butt and looked great (for the most part) doing it. But it's that other 80% of the film that was just taxing and felt like a film student's attempt at an indie Bourne. SKIP IT.

Permalink",False,"I thought many times before picking up this movie the only thing that got me to actually watch it is the cast. BIG names! But once I started watching I knew it's a mistake. The movie is designed to just show Gina Carano as the super woman, unbeatable, pretty, strong, smart and professional.. you name it. it's fine to present the main character as a super agent but forcing things too much makes the movie weak. Like in many scenes a guy tosses his gun and decides to fight her with his bare hands so you can watch a fight where she can jump and do some wrestling stuff. the guy could simply shoot her in the head and that's it! Another guy decides to punch her on the head instead of stabbing her with the knife he is carrying! OK if you have a knife and the time, just stab her! but the whole thing is to create fights where she shows her moves. Anyhow, don't let the big names trick you. Every actor appears for a little bit of time that is not enough to see him actually doing anything except getting beaten by Carano then die.. the rest of the movie is following her running or doing unnecessary old boring action!

They also tried to make the movie smart and twisted, intelligence and betrayal stuff but there's a point where you feel the whole thing is cheap so don't get all ""the prestige"" on me!

this is a very negative review I know, but seriously the movie is bad. Specially Gina's acting, she's just putting the tough all business face all the time and beats the sh*** out men! just too much to believe!

Bottom line, any romantic comedy would be a better watch!"

Permalink",False,"From the director of Traffic I expected a well scripted and acted movie. Seduced by big stars lending their name to the flick. None of it came to fruition. Convoluted plot and fitness (not former marine) instructor fights and stunt cuts. Pointless and poorly edited. The beach scene was completely humorous with a ninja like character running out of nowhere to kick bad guys behind. The only saving feature of the movie are shots of Barcelona and Dublin. The protagonist seems to try her best to show her fierceness and falls flat. Too bad the director of a masterpiece (Traffic) delivered a boring and a mediocre at best.

Permalink",False,"What ""Haywire"" seems to sell? An thrilling espionage flick with loads of fights, great action sequences and a terrific cast with the likes of Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton, Channing Tatum, Mathieu Kassovitz, Michael Fassbender, Michael Angarano and MMA's wrestler Gina Carano in the leading role, and they're all directed by Steven Soderbergh. What ""Haywire"" does sell? Nothing. Or close to it. It's so short of ideas, lacking in content and presentation, and so technically careless that is very easy to feel frustrated with such infatuating project. Sleeping pill is something from the past, this can work wonders for your sleeping problems.

The story (if there was one) isn't interesting. It's one of those clich√©d things that seemed to be taken from an old archive of scripts already made but developed in a new fashion trying to appeal to new audiences. It's preposterous. Fine, I tell what this is abut. Here's the story of a highly trained black ops soldier (Carano) who seeks revenge on the people who betrayed her during a important mission in Barcelona.

Few were the times when a film tried to look smart and copiously fails, even at serving as a source of entertainment. ""Haywire"" just makes us bored and bored, allowing us just to enjoy it in brief intermissions. The opening fight between the woman and Channing Tatum (who plays her partner in the mission) is incredible, agile, a very active moment. Then she kidnaps a bystander (Michael Angarano) of this duel of whom she tells the whole story of how she ended up fighting with a guy three times her size. Flashbacks after flashbacks, insanely annoying to follow and understand. And what's her mission anyway? Never mind, it's not worthy of attention.

This isn't totally boredom but when it finally gets gripping it's already too late. The five or six remaining sequences before the real ending are quite good (and also the fight against Fassbender in the hotel). But the vast majority of the film is bad. A bigger problem comes when the script wants to introduce awesome fighting scenes that aren't effective in no possible way. Who throws punches and kicks like that, constantly using a wall as a supportive tool all the freaking time? Even in such delicate and risky situations? It should stick to more conventional strikes instead of trying new stuff that is too unbelievable for us to care.

Strange as it may sound, the leading lady was somewhat effective. The problem is that is too hard to care for her since we don't have much background about her character. Carano is believable in some of her battles against stronger guys, but she doesn't hold dramatic scenes very well. On a similar task and on a far better film Rooney Mara really rocked in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" in all aspects. A known name should be chosen for the main role. It's kind of bizarre to see someone who isn't a real actor in the strict sense of the world being supported by giants, whose roles are so diminutive, almost unimportant.

I thought people were exaggerating about this being one of Mr. Soderbergh's films but they're right. I'm not very fond of his technique even in awarded classics like ""Traffic"" (the use of colors dividing the segments so we can known the connected characters are in different places was upsetting), but in here it was painful to watch. The editing sucks and it doesn't help in any way. And why bothering with such a pointless tedious project? Soderbergh and writer Lem Dobbs are so good together (""The Limey"", ""Kafka"") but this project didn't contribute much in their careers.

Truly disappointing. I don't see how this could be enjoyable. 3/10"

Permalink",False,"For a director who constantly claims that he'll soon be bowing about of the despicable movie business, it's been a mighty busy few years for Steven Soderbergh. Alongside the thriller-epidemic drama Contagion, and the greased up stripper drama Magic Mike was Haywire, released back at the start of 2012. I'm so close to finishing up this 366 movies in 366 days task, that I was quite excited about sitting down to this 89 minute action romp. It's reckless, rambling and certainly pulls some punches, but the repetitive blows to the head didn't stop me being bored throughout.

Gina Carano plays a black ops specialist and hitwoman. We meet her when she picks up a timid teenage boy (Michael Angarano) and takes him as a hostage. Driving across a frozen forest, she is all too willing to divulge how she's end up being this woman on the run. When a mission in Dublin reveals her employer's true motives, she goes rogue. With a slew of assassins on her tail, she's seeking vengeance on all the men that have screwed her over, and she'll go through rooftop chases and hotel bust-ups to get what she wants.

The attractive face of women's mixed martial arts, Carano's lack of acting credentials doesn't impinge on the movie. That's mainly due to her not getting much time to act, spending most of it running, hiding, or kicking ass. However, when she stops to a halt and is asked to bring a little bit more than brawn to the role, she falters, with the overdubbed dialogue and bemused, 'who farted?' facial expressions unintentionally recalling old Jackie Chan bust-em-ups like Rumble in the Bronx.

With his, at least, commercially successful Oceans Trilogy, Soderbergh is used to working with big ensemble players. Haywire is nothing different, with a machismo-heavy supporting cast worth gawking at, with Michael Fassbender, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Channing Tatum, Bill Paxton & Ewan McGregor all fighting for screen time. All but one of them will feel the pain of Carano's wrath, but until then they are relied on to bring in some degree of prestige. So much potential, yet they are all virtually superfluous thrown into the one movie.

Unlike Gareth Evans' surprise hit Indonesian movie The Raid: Redemption, which did away with any plot and just focused on the balletic, martial arts action, Soderbergh tries to have his cake and eat it with Haywire, filled with some fantastically choreographed bust-ups, whilst trying to thread an intelligible narrative. The result is formulaic and anodyne, with stylised fight sequences so far removed from reality that it all felt clinical and robotic, made only worse by the fact that, despite all the face-pummeling, there's not a single drop of blood in the movie.

Whilst it could be the launch pad for action woman Carano, Haywire is a disappointing revenge movie for everyone else involved. Shot by Soderbergh under his alias Peter Andrews, it has that standard rough and tumble, no movie light aesthetic which has permeated throughout his work since his career best, Traffic. Ugly, uninspiring and utterly forgettable."

Permalink",True,"I thought this film started well and you have a good fight at the start of the film but that's about it because the rest of the film i just didn't find interesting,this film just didn't have a very good pace to it in my opinion and the film also had a very dull feeling to it and made me not want to watch it but stupidly i kept watching it thinking it would get better boy was i wrong!. This film was so slow and dull i nearly fell asleep watching it and the only reason i gave this film a 3 is because i liked how the film started and i liked the performance from the lead women and to be honest with you she was the only character i cared about! and she was the only interesting one there! not to mention she fought even better than all the men did! and she knocked them out in hardly any time at all.I thought most of the fight scenes were quite forgettable,and in my opinion there were only two good ones,but i thought the rest sucked and were not edited right and frankly i just didn't care what the hell was going on. i guess this just isn't my type of film.This is supposed to be an Action film and there's hardly any action in it! most of the time we just get allot of talking!. Another reason i didn't like this film is Michael Douglas i mean the man is a great actor but yet in this film he has nothing to do,I like Michael Douglas and i think he can do so much better than this film! he was great in (the Game) and almost in every other film he's been in but in this one he does nothing! all i remember him doing in this film was talking! that's it. He spent most of the film walking around with all these men in suits just chatting away to them and that's all he did in the whole movie!. He was never in any of the fights and he should have been,it would have been cool to see Michael Douglas in a fight! but No the writers decide to give him nothing to do except Talk! and it was a little disappointing not to mention boring so i don't know what he was thinking when he agreed to be in this film.for me personally i just thought he could have been given more to do. As for the lead woman in this film she kicks Ass she sure knows how to fight! not to mention she was attractive so she was the only one that kept me watching but if it wasn't for her i probably would have switched the film off,i was able to see this film to the end surprisingly! considering it was quite boring.we have a fight on a beach at the end of the film that was way to long and after the fight the film ends in a very boring way with nothing much happening,no exciting music no atmosphere no story,nothing it just ends flatly and i was not impressed,there really was nothing to this film and i just didn't care about it,this was one of the most boring films iv'e seen this year!.

Permalink",False,"James Agee once wrote that casting in the movies was more about finding the right people as opposed to harvesting the most talent. It's a critical philosophy that I have often found to be true. Ideally, I suppose that theory could apply to the decision to cast mixed martial artist Gina Carano in the new espionage thriller ""Haywire."" The role demanded a martial artist. Miss Carano is an extraordinary martial artist, as she vividly demonstrates here. Throughout the movie, she scales treacherous obstacles, kicks through doors, propels herself off walls, and beats the living tar out of six people. Guess who performed her stunts! She is also physically suited for the part: comely and attractive, but not a gushy heartthrob. Unfortunately, she is not much of an actress. Not enough to make me care about her character as a human being, which, despite what the basic premise of the movie would suggest, is part of the whole idea.

I suppose James Agee's theory that you don't need a Paul Newman or a Meryl Streep to make a good casting choice applies somewhat to this film. However, as the protagonist, Miss Carano lacks the personality necessary to get an audience involved. The entire movie follows her character (a spy working for a branch-off from the government run by Michael Douglas) from Europe to the Americas, trying to unravel a double-cross, and in order for this to work, the filmmaker and the actress need to manufacture a way to get the audience to empathize on some level. As written by Lem Dobbs, the character is shaped to produce sympathy. Miss Carano is not supposed to be a mere fighting machine; she is supposed to have some heart and a deep bond with her father (Bill Paxton). We are also meant to have some empathy and try to figure out along with her why somebody had double-crossed her. So even though Miss Carano did spend most of the movie doing what she was hired for ‚Äì demonstrating her exceptional skills at martial arts ‚Äì I found it incredibly hard to care what became of her. As a result, the mystery, clever as it is, meant little to me by the end.

Another dubious casting choice was Channing Tatum as a fellow spy and one-night lover to the protagonist. Once again, he fails to impress me. Michael Douglas, as you'd expect, is reliably good, given his little screen time. I do appreciate the willingness of a star like him to play third-fiddle to lesser-known people. Ewan McGregor and Antonio Banderas are also effective in their small, personality-restricted parts.

""Haywire"" was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who made the best movie of last year, ""Contagion."" Dissatisfied as I am with his new project, I'm not shelling him out too much blame, as his beautiful style, consciously artsy photography, and natural flow of images are the saving grace of the movie. His only big lapse is a shootout midway through the picture, when he hefts the camera up on a crane, giving us an extreme wide shot in which tires are popped, somebody is shot, and a car is riddled with machine gunfire. I appreciate his willingness to try something new with a typical action movie sequence as far as photography and misc en scene are concerned, but the results in this one particular shot seem trivialized. He does better when he photographs the physical fighting, including a great shot where Miss Carano and Michael Fassbender (as a man hired to kill her) throw themselves over a couch during a brawl and the camera tilts down from overhead to follow them as they careen to the floor. Mr. Soderbergh is one of the most interesting of contemporary directors and even though ""Haywire"" is a misfire, I really hope this guy reconsiders his plans of early retirement. I don't think the world can afford to lose him when people like Michael Bay are still running amok."

Permalink",False,"It's a film that in the beginning seems extremely incoherent and that's no mistake¬Ö it is! The disjointed musical score by David Holmes doesn't help one bit either. As far as performances go, well Gina Carano did a reasonable job as Mallory Kane; I know she did most of her own stunt work which is quite impressive, but her acting skills may still need a little work. We then have the likes of Channing Tatum as Aaron, Michael Douglas as Alex Coblenz, Antonio Banderas as Rodrigo, Ewan McGregor as Kenneth, Michael Fassbender as Paul, Bill Paxton as John Kane and Michael Angarano as Scott who all played their parts well, but over all, for me, it didn't quite work.

I have come across several of these films with a decent cast but I well know that this is no guarantee of a decent film. Yes, the fight scenes are pretty spectacular, but no more so than those in the 'Bourne' films. I found the plot far too complex and this wasn't helped by the characterisations which I found it very hard to engage with. It does all tie up quite neatly in the end, but it touches every single base on the way there. The film is only an hour and a half long and it seemed a lot longer than that by the time the final credits rolled¬Ö This is not a good sign I'm afraid and so this one does not get my seal of approval.

Permalink",False,"As another reviewer has pointed out, the plot of ""Haywire""- that standard one about a secret agent betrayed by their associates and seeking revenge- could be that of a Steven Segal thriller. Except for one thing. The agent in this case is a woman, and I doubt if Segal's acting talents extend to convincingly impersonating a member of the opposite sex. (Actually, it strikes me that Segal's acting talents rarely extend even to convincingly impersonating a member of his own sex, but we'll let that pass).

A young woman named Mallory Kane meets a stranger named Scott in a diner in Upstate New York after he intervenes in a fight between her and another man. Fleeing from the scene in his car, she tells him who she is. It transpires that she works for a company that handles ""operations"" on behalf of the government. To translate that sentence into less euphemistic language, she is a member of a mercenary outfit that kills people whom the government wants dead. For some reason never made clear, someone, somewhere also wants Mallory dead, and she tells Scott how one of her associates tried to kill her during a mission. The rest of the film tells the story of how Mallory thwarts all attempts to kill her and how she takes her revenge on the conspirators.

Gina Carano clearly shares Segal's talent for the martial arts, and is certainly easier on the eye, but unfortunately she also shares his lack of talent for acting and makes a singularly uncharismatic heroine. Mallory is also a singularly unsympathetic heroine; the film never really gives us any reason to sympathise with a woman who is no more than a ruthless hired assassin. The film features a number of big-name stars, such as Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas and Ewan McGregor, but all of them appear in what are little more than cameo roles and none of them make much of an impression. Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender have more substantial parts, but both have given much better performances than the ones they give here, Tatum in ""The Eagle"" and Fassbender in ""Jane Eyre"" and ""A Dangerous Method"".

Steven Soderbergh first came to public attention as the director of the quirky, auteur-ish, independent film ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" in the late eighties. Since then he has moved more into the Hollywood mainstream, and although he has occasionally made some excellent films, notably ""Erin Brockovitch"", he has also made some dull and formulaic ones such as ""Ocean's Twelve"", which was not so much a movie, more an excuse for a bunch of A-list stars to take an agreeable European vacation. I would, however, rank ""Haywire"" even lower than that piece of tedium. With its often confusing plot, unlikeable heroine, hackneyed theme and mediocre acting this sub-standard action-thriller is the worst Soderbergh film I have yet seen. 3/10"

Permalink",False,"I applaud Soderbergh for trying to redefine the spy thriller. It's a daring experiment along the lines of the ""Bourne"" series, or even ""Taken"". However, he didn't succeed.

The plot is a rather flimsy one, about how a military contractor Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) once betrayed by someone on the inside while on assignment. The movie then follows her around as she tries to figure out who betrayed and why, getting rid of anyone who gets in her way.

On paper it sounds like a thrilling action movie, however the poorly written dialogue doesn't give the amazing cast any good material too work with. The plot is very poorly thought out. While the movie tries to explain why the betrayal took place near the end of the film, the motive is hard to believe.

The acting is rather subpar in ""Haywire"", considering the big names that are involved. Again, it's more the fault of the screenwriters than the actors. The action is very focused on hand-to-hand combat. There are no big car chases or explosions. Worst of all, even the best parts of the film, the fighting, is ruined by the terrible score (soundtrack). The music takes away from the drama of the life or death fights and does not add to the film at all.

Lastly the film is shot and lit a particular way. The film ends up looking too red and orange. While sometimes this oversaturation works like in ""HEAT"", it doesn't work well in this case. The film ends up looking quite cartoonish, rather than more serious. It reminds viewers of hipster Instagram photos in the worst way.

Overall, it's not a terrible film. However, there are many better films to watch. Not worth the time or the money, unless a huge fan of Carano."

Permalink",False,"Question: how can a movie that stars such acting talent as Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbinder and Antonio Banderas be so disappointing? Answer: because the director Steven Soderbergh - another distinguished talent - has been mesmerised into centering his film entirely on someone with no acting experience and deploying a writer, the British-born Lem Dobbs (actually Anton Kitajlly), who has created an unoriginal narrative and limp lines.

I see why Soderbergh was impressed by Gina Carano who is an attractive martial arts expert, specialising in a form of kick-boxing called Muay Thai. The fight sequences are seriously impressive. But it was a mistake to give her such a major role so soon and not to find a script that made better use of the supporting actors and a stronger storyline. The bleached colours, odd music, and terrible ending don't help either.

Permalink",False,"It's unfortunate that this film, which could have been a great vehicle for Gina Cerano, lagged. It's also unfortunate that Gina Cerano's acting ability is not at all on display here. Channing Tatum, who gave quite a good performance in The Eagle, shows us why people doubted his own abilities early on. The film is carried by the more well known actors. Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas, but their parts are too small to make a difference. Do they actually believe in Gina Cerano? Or were they well paid to get Gina a shot... You have reasonable skill as an action hero, but your acting leaves a lot to be desired. Try watching Daniel Craig sell a roll... you might learn something...

Permalink",True,"SO, If u would ask If I would watch it again I would say no. I seriously backgrounded a batman begins soundtrack on top of a conversation to feel something. When the Dialogue is staged and there is script you gotta use Music!! Music's absence is necessary in a movie, but not deleting it from the face of the Earth.

ANyway. Other than that, it felt real(realistic).(Although it felt so realistic that we could all hear the ""cameraman's breath""), part of the dialogues sometimes, were played in a way that was ""Too Much"" and they weren't so much believable! And yes I said ""boring"" one or a few times. And yes I've read almost all the first reviews on IMDb about this movie before watching it.

The actress for me was fine. I really couldn't find her so lame as everyone describes. I've seen bad actors and I wouldn't call her that.

Since I am a composer I wouldn't recommend this movie cause of that absence in many parts. And I guess it's a director's choice.(obviously)

Guys seriously, even the end credits music was so bad that I said maybe the End Credits should spare the music. Total Silence.

Plot was ordinary but well put in a row. I could actually use this movie as a project in my university school, maybe for putting some music.(That was my second thought.

And that was just my opinion. Use it well!! ;-)

Permalink",True,"Haywire, the latest, but not necessarily the newest film from Steven Soderbergh, having been on a shelf, looking for a distributor, for a good long while. It wasn't exactly worth the wait, as it is a confused, mixed bag of old tricks, but it is also not entirely without interest. Arriving on DVD and blu-ray after receiving a lukewarm theatrical response from critics and a cold shoulder from audiences. It strives to be a standard B-level thriller, really wants to be a John Le Carre-esque character based study in foreign intrigue, all when it actually should be a vehicle to showcase Gina Carano's talents, which is not acting, but martial arts proficiency. As such, Haywire fails on all accounts.

The storyline is strictly blah, it's the kind of recycled espionage potboiler plotting that we've seen far too many times before. Scripted by Lem Dobbs, this is really lazy writing for such a talent who has taken more than his fair share of genre efforts to greater heights. His credits include the imaginative Dark City, the routine, but clever De Niro-Brando mash-up The Score, and his excellent past collaborations with Soderbergh, Kafka and The Limey. The dialogue here is flat and does nothing more than to push the story to it's expected conclusion, a lot of fine actors are left looking for something to say.

When it comes to Carano the actress, she is just okay, lacking essential charisma, but able to pull off a certain authority in the role. This is not, as so commonly reported, the MMA star's first film role, but it is her first substantial one. I do see a future for Carano in film, and not just as the 21st century answer to Cynthia Rothrock, but maybe more in the realm of supporting roles, I have already heard that she may be cast in the next installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise.

An excellent supporting cast is left to save the picture, but are mostly left floundering. When I first heard about this picture, two years ago or more, I had a sinking suspicion that Soderbergh had assembled a top flight all-star supporting cast in an attempt to buy credibility. My suspicions, I think, have been confirmed. Still a cast like this, including Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregory, Bill Paxton, Michael Fassbender and Channing Tatum, among others, doesn't disappoint, they easily rise above the material. Fassbender in particular, with Douglas still is in command even in small roles, but also Paxton in his first big screen appearance since 2004.

Soderbergh has, over the years, proved to be something of an uneven director. While he has made many a good and even great movie, he also seems to have a certain affinity for hackneyed material. Soderbergh can be a daring, original and evocative filmmaker, except he also directed the three movies in the Oceans trilogy. He also likes to show off his additional filmmaking talents, here he is not only the director, but also the editor and cinematographer, he does all these jobs quite well, but perhaps he is wearing too many hats, or could it be that his head is bigger than I realize.

Haywire begins and ends with the same word, and pardon my crassness, but the word is ""shit"". I wonder if this was maybe Soderbergh way of commenting on the film, sending a subliminal message to the audience. By doing so, I doubt he's giving an apology, just confirming his frustration in the material and promising that the next one will be another Contagion, wait a minute, Contagion was actually the next one.

Permalink",True,"First let me say, I love Gina Carano. I saw this opening night with my girl, who also loves Carano. I was really excited to watch her beat some ass while being so god damn sexy. But..., roughly 20 minutes in, my girl and I were so f***ing bored that we decided to fool around. Even that couldn't keep us in the theater for the entire movie. Anyways, Carano's acting was..., bland. I did enjoy her fight scenes because I've trained BJJ and Judo for almost 20 years now and I loved how technically excellent her grappling and overall fighting was. But..., that also made everything seem very scripted. It's just not possible to transition as smoothly or use certain techniques in the situations she used them. Overall, this movie just seemed to drag on. Granted, it was full of violence and what not, but after awhile it just felt redundant. Again, I really wanted to enjoy the movie cuz I'm in love with Gina Carano but..., it was so f***ing boring.

Permalink",True,"I watch a lot of films, I guess many of us here do; I know that there are films made that are not perfect, but they entertain and we watch them and at the end we say 'that was alright'. I wish I could have said at least that much about Haywire. I really wanted to enjoy it - so many big names, a strong female lead, a director who has had a hand in the 'Oceans' films and 'The Informant!'. 'The Informant!' was different, broke out of the blockbuster mould, and was interesting - not perfect, but enjoyable. 'Haywire', however, is best summed up by the final line, the final word of the film, uttered by Antonio Banderas: 'Sh#t'. Lets start with what's right with the film: Channing Tatum, his acting is OK. And....erm.... Sorry, I am really struggling here to think of positives. Oh, and we watched it through to the end, hoping for some brilliant twist or something to make up for the general pantsness that went before. Nothing came. As for what is wrong with it.... *deep breath* the soundtrack, it turns up out of nowhere sometimes, hangs around in the middle of some dialogue, dips out then comes back. It sounds like the leftover Cds from the Oceans films and I suppose is there to make the film feel cooler, more hip than it is. It doesn't. Gina Carano is not an actress. Oh, she is evidently an expert fighter but even that seems overly choreographed at times and staged to show her flinging her feet up on to walls (kinda like how Van Damme films had shots of him doing the splits, in his straight to DVD films). As for the fighting, it seemed overtly gratuitous - with Gina being punched in the face in a way that is not designed to knock her out but in an uncomfortable brawling fashion, which is neither slick, nor impressive. The guys fighting her want to kill her or incapacitate her which pummelling doesn't really seem to achieve. Once you get past the first couple of fights they remain uncomfortable and samey, with her strangling the guy between her thighs/bicep/elbow/whatever - don't get me wrong its not the violence that sits badly with me as I am no stranger to Tarantino films, its just how its delivered in these films. Kinda like she asked her co-stars to 'punch me really hard'. This may be a sweeping stroke of a judgement but I think this film will only appeal to people who like watching people fight and not in a particularly stylish martial artist type way, but brawling. Moving on, some parts of the film seem just ridiculous and make the film look like it was made by amateurs. No offence to amateurs. At one point Carano runs off to hide as the bad guys arrive and re- appears with zebra print facial cameo paint and extremely neat cornrow plaits. All the best black-ops combat experts do this maybe? Ummmmm.... Do you know what, I could go on and on and on but it would just be a descriptive list of flaws and I only have 1000 words... sorry, I wanted to like it, but it was just, as Banderas said (one more time with feeling): 'Sh#t.'

Permalink",False,"I saw this an hour after emerging from W.E. and the first point to take pleasure from is that Steven Soderbergh can direct! He may not be high on the list of living directors the general public can name (alas, after Spielberg and Scorsese there aren't many) but you'll certainly know of his collaboration with George Clooney and many of his films: Contagion, The Informant, Traffic, Ocean's Eleven, Twelve & Thirteen¬Ö When I first saw the trailer, it looked like a fairly typical action flick with an attractive woman kicking ass rather than a man. The cast that I knew (Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Antonio Banderas¬Ö) added weight and Soderbergh's name convinced me to take a punt.

Mallory Kane (mixed martial arts fighter Gina Carano, Crush in American Gladiators) is a black ops soldier hired out by her dastardly boss to do very bad things (i.e. kill people) for governments that would prefer not to know about it. After rescuing a hostage in Barcelona, she is sent on a job to Dublin with barely enough time to unpack. She discovers she's been double-crossed and becomes a little bit narked.

Haywire comes in at a little over 90 minutes but felt substantially longer than that, which isn't a great sign. Kane is a tough cookie, a skilled fighter and knows it's a case of kill or be killed but Soderbergh has her entertain us with repetitive unarmed combat that smashes up the house and provides an overture of grunts and gasps when, surely, all she would do is shoot the creep in the back. It's a pity he doesn't have the balls to direct her do so and then concentrate on a sharp plot.

The film hangs on Carano and, unfortunately, she's not a great actress. She has, perhaps, two expressions and they work well but mostly her face doesn't move with her mouth and after one fight too many I was hoping the bad guys would blow her away and we'd have a real twist. We didn't. And I still don't know why she took the college lad with her and told him her life story instead of just stealing the car and creating her own, private mayhem. Maybe it isn't just the events on the screen that were haywire.

It's far from Soderbergh's best and I don't imagine I'll remember much about it in March, let alone at the end of the year. Watch it but save your money and do so on DVD.

The PQ was very bland as well as the AQ. Over-all the presentation was dull and lifeless.

We did watch the movie throughout, however it is not one that I ever plan on watching again. It was all over the place and difficult to watch.

Being a female agent means you get paid less than your male counterparts, even though you always have to go undercover as prostitutes.

However, the femme fatale in this action movie isn't feuding with her superiors over wages.

Hire out by her boss (Ewan McGregor) to retrieve a journalist imprisoned in Barcelona, Mallory (Gina Carano) executes her job with ease.

Later, however, she is famed for the journalist's death. With no options, she goes after the men who hired her: a government official (Michael Douglas) and a Spanish emissary (Antonio Banderas).

Along the way, she also uncovers evidence alluding to her own agency's involvement.

Despite its leads inability to act, she can certainly deliver brutal beatings. And supporting that break-neck action is a semi-decent tale of deceit.

However, the best way for an agency to prevent a patsy from retaliating is to revoke their covert-ops discount at the gun store. (Yellow Light)

Permalink",True,"It has been a long time since I've seen the qualities of great actors wasted to an amateur film like this. No matter what the directors reputation is. They've tried to clone Jason Bourne into the main character Gina Carano, without any success.

Some fans may support the move by saying that all the gaps in the story and the poor scenes are meant to be funny. I didn't laugh at all although I do laugh very easily. :D

Poor scenario you ask? --spoiler alert-- The streets are swarming with cops and special forces. They are all out looking for a young woman. Mallory finds herself a green sweater in a car and gets automagically ignored by all the cops. And no, it's not a MI6 cloaking device. Mallory gets stopped but may proceed because the girl they're after doesn't have a green sweater. This is something we've seen happen many times but in this movie I simply don't believe it.

Chasing scenes were mostly longshots of mallory climbing a drainpipe, climbing the stairs or running thru the streets.

I would almost suspect this: The director of this film adores Gina Carano. He took the first script he could find for a female character, sat down with some Hollywood friends to make this tribute to her. Is the story credible? ""Doesn't matter!"" Is the acting OK? ""Not important"" Is Gina looking gorgeous? Now you understand the quality of this film. ;-)

Gina Carano is beautiful and a legitimate female BA who makes the Angelina Jolie's of the world who try and play characters like Salt look ridiculous in comparison. That being said, her acting ability leaves a lot to be desired. That plus the weak development of the plot and characters take away from the outstanding action sequences. Also, I am not a big fan of the new movement in Hollywood to try and throw an 80's vibe into modern films. It comes off as corny and makes the movies feel cheap. Nonetheless, the movie is still worth watching and, even though I may have been a little harsh on the grading of it, I would like to see them continue the movie into a series and see how Carano can grow as an actress.

To have an end fight scene with Mcgregor was hopeless... he's no fighter and Soderberg was compensating for that like an amateur director. There was too much of an extreme between the fight scene in the beginning and the lame sequence at the end. And the gawd awful waste of film capturing Carano running and driving... I mean, what gives?

The plot line was just unbelievable predictable for an approach which was suppose to contain elements of surprise at the end.

I don't know, but I feel like the producer decided to create the movie as a parody with top billing cast and director, and instructed them to make it as bad as they can; and see whether the viewers would still claim that it's great.

And they'd have a great laugh about it later - Emperor's Invisible Dress Syndrome

Permalink",False,"Once again we must ask how a cast as fine as the one assembled for this mess of a movie signed on to be associated with it. Surely there must be a reason because if they had read the script (which could have been more than two or three pages of lines in length!) they would have seen that there is no plot to speak of - just a series of poorly executed incidents, each they response to a newly identified character whose background is so ignored that we are left without a clue as to how the characters are interrelated. Lem Dobbs is credited as 'writer' and the big surprise is that this is a product of Steven Soderbergh's direction.

The plot is summarized as follows: 'Beautiful freelance covert operative Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is hired out by her handler to various global entities to perform jobs which governments can't authorize and heads of state would rather not know about. After a mission to rescue a hostage in Barcelona, Mallory is quickly dispatched on another mission to Dublin. When the operation goes awry and Mallory finds she has been double crossed, she needs to use all of her skills, tricks and abilities to escape an international manhunt, make it back to the United States, protect her family, and exact revenge on those that have betrayed her.'

The supporting cast, most of which are so ambiguous that we forget their names, is carried out by such fine actors as Michael Angarano, Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton, Maximino Arciniega, Maximino Arciniega and some other very talented but misused actors. Even the special effects are poorly executed. Apparently this film was created to feature the MMA (that's Mixed Martial Arts for those who don't follow sports) champion Gina Cardona.

Permalink",False,"Haywire was a big disappointment considering to be from Steven Sodhberg and containing A-List actors. Mallory is double-crossed by her agency whom she was working for. Now , she must watch their step closely before taking any chances and unravel the truth.

Steve Soderbergh , director of Ocean's Series , Erin Brokvich, is not in form this time. The direction was weak along with the storyline which we have seen on screen multiple times before. When I saw the trailer , I was pretty excited about this flick as it had some cool action sequences. But I was disappointed with the end result. It was a pretty boring movie with a waste of talented actors. The screenplay was full of potholes that sometimes I was wondering what was going on. The only silver lining was nice action stuff from martial art expert Gina Carona. Being her first film , she was quite confident in terms of her acting , her dialogues delivery and her action sequences. Cinematography was eye- catching capturing the beautiful locales of Barcelona and Dublin. Background score was pale. Art direction was decent.

Overall , a complete waste of time with nothing new to offer except for some nice action scenes by Gina Carona. She has potential in her and she will might make it big ."

Permalink",False,"This film is poor, the direction leaves you wondering if the actors had any input or just took the money and did as they were told. In the beach fight scene McGregor is running away from Carano, he has a whole beach to run across, instead he runs to a 15ft rock and tries to climb it, cue more badly choreographed fighting. The fight scenes were very mediocre, which elevated them above the script and the characterization, the lack of believability of any of the actors left me not caring if, or when, they got shot, or how many times. It was one of the few movies I have watched where I wasn't bothered that the ending was weak, I was just glad it had ended. I cannot understand why it scores 6.5 on IMDb, I defy anyone to come up with one redeeming feature for this poor poor film.

Permalink",False,"I was so hyped to see this movie and when I missed it in theaters I couldn't wait for the blu-ray. Well I picked it up yesterday and watched it¬Ödamn it. I was kinda let down, the fights were the best part and were nice and gritty and awesome. But the in between was so freakin slow, they could have cut half of her running and walking out of the movie. Seriously the movie could have been called ""watch Gina Carrano walk and run"". And the 70's music was stupid. Worth seeing, regretting the blu-ray perches would be an OK walmart $10 bin movie buy. I give it a 5 cause the fights were good and it had a good cast, just the director should have left more on the cutting room floor and made the movie a little more fast paced.

Permalink",False,"I knew next to nothing about the film before watching, having only picked up keywords like ""Gina Carano"", ""Super-soldier"", and ""revenge"". I certainly wasn't expecting something in between Drive and a Bourne movie. The casting is good, direction oftentimes excellent, fights not too overdone, choice and use of music interesting but hit and miss.

The settings and story are gritty and realistic, and the concept of cold war-style betrayal cat and mouse games moving into the private sector is interesting and works well. It's obvious that Soderbergh has been significantly influenced by the last ten or fifteen years of American Independent movies in terms of pace and angles.

Unfortunately Gina Carano can't act. Her (altered, apparently) voice is completely monotone, and she's as expressionless as Arnold in his heyday. This doesn't work well with closeups and slow-paced conversation about mostly trivial subjects.

With a different lead this movie could have been a gem - though it would almost certainly have been less well known. As it turned out though, it's mediocre and will only wow you if your expectations are as low as mine were."

Permalink",True,"The problem with a lot of audiences today is that they're used to being spoon-fed everything so they don't have to actually watch a movie to know what's happening in it. This one you have to watch. Most of the first half of the film is told in flash-backs and if you're not paying attention you won't be able to figure out what's going on or why. Yeah, it gets boring in parts and it jumps all over the place because of those flash-backs but that's one of the things I liked about this.

This is Gina Carano's first starring role and she shows a few flaws but I'm not sure if it's because of it being her first or because of the direction she had in this movie. She's a great fighter and has several well choreographed scenes that show off her talents but where she fails is showing any emotion. As a trained ""agent"" you'd think she could handle herself in a party atmosphere but she seems out of place there. There's also a scene where she leaves her father alone with people she knows could, and probably would, kill him. Since there's no back-story showing her past or how she got her training I can only conclude that the director and writer simply wanted to show off her martial arts skills and didn't care about any other aspect of her character. Hopefully she'll get better, more fleshed-out roles in the future because I think she could be a great action movie star eventually.

This certainly isn't a great movie. The big name actors are used too sparingly to be called co-stars. The lack of any depth, in any of the roles, along with some bad music cues, bad character decisions and only implied conclusions to the main adversaries shows poor writing skills and bad decisions from a usually good director. I give it a 5 out of 10 simply because of Ms. Carano's presence in the film. Anyone else would have probably dropped this down to a 2 or 3.
